9,35437,Overview,4.5,"This is a lovely cafe, beautiful cats and very peaceful atmosphere. Very nice drink and cakes. They do all they can to make sure the cats are happy and comfortable - but unfortunately this takes priority over everything else and this can cause some issues for vulnerable customers.   Lighting level is quite low, and there are lots of items around that could cause issues for people who with visual issues. Again I can understand why this is good for the cats, but it’s not good for us.    It’s all on one level and you can get to most of it using a wheelchair (Part of it is up a step). The gates to stop cats escaping are quite hard to negotiate, some staff will help you (others just turn away and sort coffee cups out but other customers helped us)   Be prepared to move furniture/cat equipment to get around in a wheelchair.  I have no idea if you are meant to - no one has ever offered to help or challenged us so I guess it’s ok :)   Accessible toilet is ok - one of the standard ones for people who can transfer. But we couldn’t get in there as turning circle to get to door was full of cat contraptions.  There is a changing places loo in the Arndale two minutes away fortunately.   Some of the staff are really kind and helpful, others not so much.  We don’t expect the entire world to revolve around us - but there are a few small things they could do to make it more accessible. It’s a shame as it’s such a beautiful idea and it could be a fabulous therapeutic place to chill. ",cat cafe manchester,positive,1,1

Then we headed to the dolls house section.  The ramp was not flush to the ground and at the other end was not flush to the floor inside, again requiring my carer to lift and tip the wheelchair.  Once in, not all houses are visible because they are too high.  The wheelchair map wasn't given to us and when we found out about it, staff made a song and dance about getting it for us.

183,21663,Access,2.0,"There are several methods of entering the garden centre: - Main entrance, this is level access so is perfectly fine for anybody in a wheelchair, walking frame etc. -Front plant display, there is a display of plants to purchase directly off of the car park. There are several aisles to chose from but all but one have steps several inches high which there is no way I could negotiate even with the help of my PA. There is one single aisle with a ramp leading up to it which I could easily roll up but part way up there is a large pot hole. The owners have tried to make an effort to fill this by adding a block of wood which sadly does very little to make it possible to negotiate with a wheelchair. -Cafe, there is a wooden ramp leading into the cafe which is very easily accessible. From this entrance you have free access to the whole cafe and the lower level of the gift shop, to get to the upper level of the gift shop and the garden centre there is a very steep ramp. There is no way I would be able to push myself up this ramp and to be honest it was a struggle with my PA and I both pushing. Once in the garden centre there were places where there was a single step or a gap into a greenhouse or from one area to another. The staff had obviously realised that these were problematic to someone in a wheelchair so had tried to “bodge” a ramp from whatever was lying around which were inappropriate so had broken and not been replaced or were not big enough so had fallen into the gap they were trying to cover. In the plant area occasionally there was an obstacle in the way such as a trolley waiting to be unloaded or a big plant or tree, which meant I couldn’t get passed so had to turn around and find another route. The gift shop was very tight to get around and I was constantly very conscious of all the beautiful but very delicate items for sale there. As previously mentioned the gift shop is on two levels with a very steep ramp between the two. The cafe is very tight in places but there are enough tables on the periphery that were accessible to someone in a wheelchair and the staff were exceptionally helpful to ensure we were seated and comfortable. There is also a beautiful outside seating area with children’s play area for the cafe which can be accessed by a wooden ramp.

Unfortunately, the rock was shrouded in mist appearing briefly before disappearing again. The popularity of the café was evident by the number of occupied tables. We were lucky, as just before we came in, a table became vacant.  As our party included 3 wheelchairs, and 2 of which being quite large  it was felt that the space was just too limited. Carers need to check out the table to ensure everybody is seated comfortably alongside whoever is assisting them.   This café is not suitable for large wheelchairs.

385,28327,Overview,4.5,"Edinburgh Airport has been striving to improve services to assistance passengers for years, and I think it is beginning to show.  Departures: You can go directly to the assistance reception if you want assistance from start to finish, but you need not deal with them if you don't want to. If you prefer to be independent through the airport, simply go and get a gate check tag for your chair from the baggage drop area and take yourself through departure procedures. You will be fast tracked through security even if you arrive without a member of staff, then you can make your own way to the gate area which is where you wait for security. You are then collected and taken down for assistance into the plane, there is no need to sit anywhere special and you are included in all the information given to other passengers. Staff have been very good at asking what way I prefer to be assisted.   Arrival: I am usually met fairly promptly and the wheelchair is brought to the plane. Beware that sometimes you get into the lift and then they drive you to the terminal and you get out again. If you are on a very nearby gate, you will go down in the lift and and straight out again. They don't always remember to tell you, so they stand there wondering why you didn't get out again already!

545,43362,Access,5.0,"Vieux Nice is a relatively small, mostly flat and mainly pedestrianised area. The shopping area gently slopes at the furthest points from the sea front. There is a maze of narrow streets and squares, so it’s fine at quieter time but in the busy summer season it may feel quite crowded. The tall, historic buildings have ochre, yellow and red facades, making the area very photogenic. This is also a residential area so look up and you might see someone’s washing on their clothes line. There are no benches in the area, but there are lots of cafes is you want to rest. Most of the cafes have some outdoor seating and it makes it a great place to people watch.  Directly behind the sea front is Cours Saleya, market place. This is a large rectangular, flat padestrianised square. It hosts a daily flower market held in the mornings, up until about 12 – 1pm, so I suggest getting there by mid- morning, as when the stalls have sold their produce they start to close up. Monday to Saturday there is also a food market and on Sundays an antiques/ flea market. Even if you are not into shopping the market is a must see. The flower stalls are impressive with their seasonal displays. The food stalls sell local home grown fruits and vegetables plus there are cheese stalls, olive oil stalls, and ones selling olives, herbs and spices. Look out for Chez Thérésa's stall in the market which sells slice of socca (a large, chickpea pancake, a regional dish) which is delivered by motor bike, see photo from my previous visit. The gift stalls sell high quality, local products and crafts, including stalls selling prettily, coloured soaps in an assortment of floral fragrances. The stalls are quite spaciously laid out in rows. Surrounding the Cours Selaya are restaurants and bars which stay open until the evening and it's a great place to people watch. If you visit Cours Saleya, watch out as they wash down the stall area regularly, which can make the pavement a little slippy at times.  Behind Cours Saleya there’s lots of local shops, cafes, restaurants. Mostly in narrow streets. This is a place to wander around and explore. There are some lovely take away cake places, my favourites are Boulangerie du Palais, 21 Rue du Marché (look out for their pig cakes), and Boulangerie Blanc, 10 Rue Alexandre Mari, both with a single entrance step and Patisserie LAC, 12 Rue de la Préfecture, which is also a chocolate shop and step free. Maison Auer, 7 Rue Saint-François de Paule, directly opposite the Opera House (see seperate review). There is a small step into this beautiful chocolate shop and if you visit remember to take a look at the ceiling in the room at the back (I put some photos of the chocolate shop on my Christmas Nice review).   Look out on Rue de la Préfecture for Loggia Communale, with a small display of historic stones and sculptures, see photo. There are several picturesque square including Place Rossetti, where Cathedral Sainte Reparate (separate review) is and several restaurants.

I had no trouble with access, there were many helpful staff, the ramp was well designed, the gallery was largely empty, so I was able to see many more paintings than usual, and look at the smaller works for as long as I wanted. It is really a good opportunity to see these rooms, which do include some very famous renaissance and Scottish artists, without the usual crowds. Tickets are free.   My only problem was with using the disabled loo, ordinarily I would have used the modern one on the lower ground floor, but this is closed off from access from the gallery. I visited with my scooter, which is very small, 52cm wide and 1m long. The door and corridor to the loo was really only wide enough for this, and while the scooter did fit inside the loo there was no room to turn around. The doors were very hard to open, but here the staff were very willing to help. My only negative was that not only was the emergency cord tied up, it had clearly been cut so it couldn’t drop to the floor.

The hotel was wheelchair accessible including the rooftop bar which could be accessed using the lift. There was also a swimming pool which had a chair that enabled people with mobility issues to get into the pool (see photos).  We booked a double room and a king suite that had an interconnecting doors (see photos). The king suite had a wet floor en-suite bathroom. In it was a shower which had a flip down bench to sit and wash on. Alternatively if you cannot transfer onto the bench or stand up there is enough room to for a shower wheelchair (see photos). The mattresses were very soft which made moving and handling tricky.  The hotel restaurant was accessible and the food tasted great. In the morning the breakfast staff were happy for a member of my family to bring me back a selection of breakfast goodies which I could then eat in my bed.   The location of the hotel was perfect for us. Away from the busy inner city noise and traffic but still close enough to visit the city sights etc. The metro station foggy bottom is a short distance away from the hotel which made it relatively easy to explore the city centre. Being on the edge of the city encouraged us to hire a wheelchair accessible car (see photo) and travel to Arlington cemetery, mount Vernon and Alexandria.

It contains so much information inside such a small building, I was shocked by how much history I soaked up on a short visit. Beatrix Potter is now my favourite historical hero and before my visit I knew nothing about her life.  The entry fee is £5 per person, which is not made clear on any signage and you are only told once you try to move from the gift shop into the museum. I was a little taken aback as I had assumed it was free and I was also told sternly ""no photos!"" when I took my phone out to check the time.  We went through the double doors into the museum and started reading the wall features and looking the items on display. I didn't realise until after a few blocks of texts that we were actually moving around the small museum in the wrong direction and I was reading about Beatrix Potters life in reverse. It wasn't clear to myself or my carer where we should have started reading.  In any case it was so interesting and it is nice that this history has been preserved. I feel like the knowledge I gained was worth the entry fee. There wouldn't be much to do for children or people who can't or don't enjoy reading as the display is extremely text heavy and more like you have stepped into a book. It's not interactive in any way. It's very bright, white and orderly.  There is a library upstairs which I thought would be interesting to see. We used the wheelchair lift which was easy to use and the staff showed us how to use it safely. I was surprised that so much care had been taken to make the building as accessible as possible and was really happy that I could visit the library. The library is a collection of older books and you can look at as many as you want. I think I should have made a day trip out of this as book preservation really interests me but I didn't have time to look around.  The volunteers do have two friendly little dogs who run around and greet you uostairs so if you are afraid of small dogs or have an allergy I would bear this in mind too.

Last year we went we were literally the only people in the accessible campsite - it was a huge ground with two portable loos.  This year there was about 10 tents and 3 portable loos - 2 that were really wheelchair accessible. It would had been good that if the accessible campsite had a sign. I also liked the way they published set times and a map before everyone arrived online.   Though this year there was no confusion of where we got our waistbands - though I did have to go and ask somebody at the gate.   I'll be honest and say I had a baby wipe bath as the showers only had cold water and from what I could see there was no accessible showers.  The arena itself was good but could be improved. The accessible seating area at the main stage was not used, only by toddlers as a play thing, it was only raised by about 20cm and it would pretty much had been impossible to see the stage - but the thought was there.  The whole site was pretty much accessible but at night it got really dark and cold, some lights would had been good.

1147,38953,Overview,4.0,"I was late coming to opera, which opened up for me with the provision of surtitles, where the words sung in their original language are translated into English and projected onto a screen above the stage so they can be easily read.  My carer and I had gone to see an opera in 2016 that I was thoroughly enjoying, until just after the Interval.  The staff had expressed themselves unhappy about me sitting on my rollator seat in the allotted wheelchair space, in case the view of the person behind was blocked, although nobody complained.  So they let me use the theatre's wheelchair, which proved lovely and comfortable, and also proved not to belong to the theatre.  It was taken from me shortly after the Interval, not only upsetting me but distracting me from the opera itself.  Then the surtitles failed.  My disabilities are such, this, combined with the distress I had already been made to feel, left me confused and I could not get back into the story.  In frustration, I E-mailed Venue Cymru to request a refund.  This was initially denied, but I was eventually offered tickets for a performance of Othello (as an opera) later that year.  However, it transpired I was given a wrong performance date, and couldn't go as a result.  This involved me in yet more effort but the matter was eventually sorted and I and a different companion got tickets to see Le Vin Herbe, a re-telling of the Tristan legend.  We attended the 4th April 2017 performance - and nothing went wrong.  I have a Hynt card issued by the Welsh government that allows me to take a carer along free of charge and the Welsh National Opera are really good.

1228,31942,Access,4.5,"We entered directly from High Street Kensington and it was step free. There is also an entrance from Holland Park, but I didn't use that.   On the concourse on the way to the museum entrance look at the pavement, as the names of the Commonwealth countries are dotted about, as a reminder tot he building previously being the Commonwealth Institute. Also on the way to the entrance you will pass a separate museum shop, which is step free. There is also a water feature but the space is wide enough to avoid getting splashed and just outside the museum there is some bench seating, with most of it not having a supportive back rest.  There are 2 sets of automatic entrance doors and the ticket desk is immediately on your left when you enter. The Kubrick exhibition is immediately in front and is all on the ground floor with step free access. On the ground level there is also the shop, accessible toilet and a stepped seating area with no back support, which I was only able to access sitting on the front row.  I had looked on the website before I visited and saw that wheelchairs could be reserved, so I pre-booked this. I was asked to collect the manual wheelchair from the ticket desk and it was waiting for me on arrival. My experience with the wheelchair was rather unfortunate. After being in the exhibition about 10 minutes the left foot rest came out. My friend but it back in for me but it came out again about 10 minutes later and we were unable to fix it. I returned to the main entrance and explained to the member of staff what had happened and asked if I could return the wheelchair and have my crutch back, I had asked and they had looked after it while I had the wheelchair. The member of staff was unable to leave her location and had to radio another member of staff, who came quite quickly. However I had to wait a few minutes for my crutch to be returned and that was quite difficult as there was no where to sit. I re-entered the exhibition and continued with using my crutch.   While I was going round the exhibition in a wheelchair I observed that my legs were unable to fit under the display cabinets and this meant I had to view the objects in the case side on. Also the cabinets had black casing which added to the difficulty in viewing the objects, this could have been avoided if the cabinets were see-through. I'm only an occasional wheelchair users so not very competent in steering, but I found I often kept catching myself on the sharpness of the corners of the display cabinets. Where there was text this was often too small a font and too high up for me to read it clearly while I was a wheelchair user, also the contrast between the text and the background was hard to see due to the colour of the writing.   There was very limited seating in the exhibition as it was only in the areas that were showing film clips. They were small dark cinema style booths with a single bench seating with no back support. There are no subtitles for the video clips. The exhibition is fairly large, there's lots of things to see and we were there for over 2 hours, and also there were fold up stools available some additional firm seating areas, which make transfers easier would have been welcome.  I do not know if this exhibition was typical of the museum's other galleries, as the Kubrick exhibition has been traveling the world and I'm not sure how much is identical to what it would be like in other venues and how much had been adapted to fit in for the Design Museum.

Unfortunately on busier shows some people had booked the seats around the wheelchair spaces without needing the wheelchair space itself which is not the fault of the cinema however I would recommend booking in advance because of this. I was able to book online and was sent an email to show on arrival via my phone screen so we did not have to queue at all.  My only issue would be the temperature in each screen.

On arriving we were very concerned as our first impression was that of a budget type hotel which did not impress us at all, but decided that having made the effort,  we would check it out and offer you a review.  WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE !  Inside, it’s a delightful hotel, we were really in awe, and pleased we did persevere. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY YOUR FIRST VIEW OF OUTSIDE AREAS.  The Crowne Plaza Marlow hotel is ideally placed in the Thames valley and close to Chilton hills, with easy reach from M4, M40 and M25 motorways, and it’s set in 5 acres of countryside, with views over its lake setting. Free parking, with 3 disabled bays available, a 168 bedroom 4 star hotel, built in 2002, and renovated in 2020, (but for us, the exterior deco and overall look was disappointing, a little off putting, but what a pleasant surprise inside ) with 3 floors of bedrooms, and inside you will find an AA rosette Glaze restaurant, which serve a very good Indian food menu, the Aqua bar lounge area, a conservatory with terrace seating with lawn views over to lake.  OUR REVIEW FOR PART ONE A pleasant roadside drive with well maintained grounds leading up to hotel (photo 1) with a woodland setting for its nice carpark (photo 2), then we saw the hotel, and oh what a disappointment (3)  Our first thought was to drive straight out, it looked so drab. But having made the trip, we decided to review it anyway. 3 disabled bays stand by the main door (4) and there was a pull handled door for wheelchair access (5) the other is a revolving door, but it’s all on the level.  Inside, oh what a contrast ! The reception area was breathtakingly highly polished tiled flooring, very appealing (6) and the seating area, which we called the meet and greet area, again very comfortable and very attractively decorated (7). The reception desk was in a huge open area, plenty of room to move around, and looked so nice (8). We found the toilets close by (9) but no disabled to be seen (10) but both mens and ladies were clean, shining, and very nice modern design, and ladies close to mens (11) that lead towards the bar.  This was a beautiful area with its piano leading towards the bar, (12) of which the floor was unusually laid but looked delightfully shiny and added to the appeal of the area. The bar had an ambience about it (13) looking inviting, so we relaxed in the comfortable lounge and enjoyed our drinks (14). We glanced into the restaurant, which again looked inviting (15) with an Indian menu on display. The hotel is run by very friendly polite Asian people, so if you like Indian food you will enjoy it here.Our overall look at the delightful restaurant, with its beautiful tiled floor, which gave it so much character (16) and a doorway led us into the conservatory, again inviting you to come and sit in it, (17) and enjoy afternoon tea, with very comfortable furniture (18) and a push handled door to take you out onto the terrace (19).  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS After the disappointing frontage to the hotel, inside was so elegant and tastefully decorated, the floors were highly polished and shiny, it was a delight to be inside the hotel. We would certainly recommend this hotel, just don’t be put off by the outside appearance. The staff were extra friendly and supportitive, it was so nice to talk with them all.

1354,54614,Overview,4.0,"This hotel 2 years ago was part of the Hilton group, sold on to become M40 J15 hotel and now taken over as the Delta Marriott Bonvoy hotel, recently opened late 2021. Sadly, we were disappointed to note that no expense has been put towards bringing the exterior of hotel to an acceptable standard, especially as you arrive at hotel, then close to entrance rot is evident on many wooden areas, and generally it’s an unkempt outside areas, and we find Hotels of this description can be most off  putting, as to us, first impressions do count.  However, once inside it’s quite a nice hotel, clean throughout, recently refurbished, and looks inviting, that is if unlike my husband, you notice that a lick of paint on the woodwork areas would be most welcomed, but it should not put you off using this hotel, and if it’s a quick visit you need, somewhere handy to stay close to M40, then this would suit you well.  A large car park awaits you, with 11 disabled bays just to the side of hotel. (photo 1) A path leads ahead towards the main entrance which is easy to manage (photo 2) but it does pass a very unkempt wooden structure badly in need of maintenance, but it’s been like that for many years now, perhaps to be seen to in the future, but the picture hides just how bad it is.  The main entrance approach is very plain, and uninspiring, (photo 3) and then the swing doors are not wide enough to get any chairs into, so you have to use one of the two side doors, which have pull handles,  (photo 4) but almost impossible to open on your own. (Just in case you have to use) there is a small brick paved ramp to get on or off the hotels path.  (Photo 5) shows a pleasant reception area which awaits you, BUT PLEASE DO LOG YOUR CAR IN, you register details on the screen by the desk for reception. Then ahead of you is the bar lounge, and at far end is the bar itself, (photo 6). where you book in for breakfast. It’s a very pleasant area (photo 7) and relaxing to sit in. There is a spacious area for breakfast, clean and tidy ready for you to enjoy their breakfast.  It’s a buffet style help yourself arrangement, even for your hot tea or coffee, or cold drinks which you have to pick up and serve yourself, but with all the usual drinks available (photo 8) and the many buffet bars are well stocked and  cleanly presented with plenty of choice. (Photo 9) while cereals, croissants and freshly baked delicious rolls are available. (Photo 10) and a good selection of hot food provided at the far counters.  For evening dinner it is served in a small separated restaurant with a ramp for easy access to it (photo 11) and the restaurant is very warm and cosy looking, a very nice area to enjoy your meal (photo 12) There is a few nice seating areas to then relax in ( photo 13) perhaps to have a coffee or a drink later on and just behind this lounge, the reception area leads you towards the lifts and bedrooms (photo 14) with spacious corridors to the bedrooms (photo 15) and alongside are two lifts (photo 16) in which a scooter or powerchair could get in and spin around. Back by reception there are disabled toilets available, but with push doors, (photo 17) to get into the separate  mens and ladies disabled toilets, which are large enough for any chair to move around in, and are clean and tidy, with pull cords and grab rails  (Photo 18) shows the general mens public toilet, not the disabled one. Close by there is a gym available, with separate lockers and changing rooms (photo 19) and a good selection of weights and treadmills ect, and the whole area is very clean and tidy (photo 20).  Our final thoughts If you ignore the outside spaces which is rather unkempt, you will be pleasantly surprised when you get inside hotel. It’s cosy and relaxing to enjoy either a meal, or just to sit with a cup of tea or cold drink. We would recommend this hotel to you, bearing in mind it’s just a basic type of a motorway stopover hotel, perhaps a bit better than that, but it’s comfortable and clean.",delta hotels by marriott warwick warwick,positive,1,1

1367,32406,Overview,3.0,"We were staying in County Donegal and wanted to find an accessible beach, so I did a search for beach wheelchairs and found that there was one you could borrow at Marble Hill Strand. The information was on the county council website here: https://www.donegalcoco.ie/services/environment/blueflagbeachesgreencoast/ .     The beach wheelchair is kept by the Shandon Hotel, so we phoned them as instructed and booked the beach wheelchair for the day. Both on the phone and when we got to the hotel, the staff were pleasant and helpful, although we got the impression it had been quite some time since anybody had enquired about the wheelchair. And this was probably because... the Shandon is not actually near the beach! With some effort, we partially dismantled the beach wheelchair and just about squeezed it into the car with one of the back seats down, and then we drove to Marble HIll Strand, where we discovered that only one small section of the beach has an obvious concrete ramp down to it, and that is cut off from the main stunning beach by rocks and the sea. However, when we asked if there was any other way to the beach, a lifeguard tipped us off that we could drive down the main coast road to the far end of the beach and go down a private unsurfaced road, which was pretty sandy and bumpy, but not impossible for our standard family car. We were able to park the car - again with a bit of trepidation - on what was essentially a grass-covered dune off the private road, and then, with a lot of muscle involved from my partner, reassemble the beach wheelchair and bump me in it down onto the beach a few metres away.  This was all a bit of a palaver, but it was absolutely worth it, because I rarely get to go right onto such a fabulous wild beach with dunes, and we had a lovely time.",marble hill strand dunfanaghy,negative,0,1

On arrival through the entrance gates, there is a white rectangle in the ground.mif your chair fits this, you can fit in the lift. Considering the age and historical nature of this building, I was totally surprised how much has been done to make it accessible. I would say avoid buys days/times if you can as some parts need you to be escorted by castle staff to access and if you go off peak  you have to wait less.  I was in a power wheelchair, having just changed from using a manual and mobility scooter. Some places you need very good control to maximise your ability to turn through the narrow spaces etc. Note a good Venue for the new to using equipment as some places are narrow and twisty and you need to be able to navigate round people eg the dolls house room.  Or back up and down a narrow ramp as there's only space for one user at a time, and it's the only way in or out of the house. However we will go back another day as my children weren't well which meant we had to end our trip early, but staff were amazing. It IS HILLY and STEEP and has COBBLES, some of the outer rooms have steps, so I didn't worry about accessing them, but worth knowing to help other expectations, and my companion was able to access help when we got stuck, or check out what I wasn't missing :)  I previously visited this years ago (in the year after the fire) and from my memories as an I disabled person, I was put aware of missing much :) ",windsor castle windsor,negative,0,1

1569,33509,Overview,4.5,"If you have youngsters with you, then this is an ideal visit, with lots for them to do, a very nice play area, and lots of farm animals to see as you walk around the farm. There is a very nice farm shop to buy fresh produce from, and it’s simply called The Farm, set in beautiful country side around Snitterfield, close to Stratford apon Avon.  As you drive in (photo 1) along the driveway you pass the pig farm, very clean and well looked after, no smells here, then the garden area, which you can stroll through. The car park is large and laid with hardcore pressed chippings, (photo 2) and easy to push a wheelchair along. The two disabled bays are very close to shop entrance (photo 3) which is all on the level, with automatic sliding doors (photo 4). Just inside the door you will find the fruit and veg section (photo 5)  again on the level, with stone or concrete floors, with plenty of room to move about. There is a reasonable selection of both fruit and veg, and good quality (photo 6). This leads you now to the fresh bread and cakes section, with an excellent choice, but although it’s not baked on the premises it seems it’s delivered fresh every day. Next to this is the wine department (photo 8)  As you move around the shop you will find plenty of space (photo 9) and it’s very easy to take your wheelchair, or even a large power chair.  You then come to the butchers, (photo 10) with lovely looking fresh meats on display, then the pies section (photo 11)  and on to the cheese counter (photo 12)  which has a really nice selection, but it’s brought in from local manufacturers and pre-packed, but very good cheeses.  The large cafe is next, (photo 13) with an outdoor seating area as well, close to activities for the young to enjoy, and the cafe has lots of room to move around in, (photo 14) with very wide spaces, it looks inviting, spotlessly clean, and ideal spot to enjoy your coffee and cakes. Coming out and back into the shop, you arrive at the world food section, (photo 15) where you buy your chutneys and sauces, not a great choice, but again, plenty of room to move. Just off that it a little area where you can buy crockery and bits and pieces, (photo 16) it’s just a fascinating place to look around, ( but it is a bit tight for wheelchairs, so may need care here. )  but you will also find a choice of plants which  are well looked after.  The check out is then by exit door (photo 17) plenty of room again.  However, we must say sorry to you, because we forgot to check out toilet facilities , we know they are there, but as we did not need to use them, we forgot, but if the rest of the farm is anything to judge by, then we feel the toilet would be well looked after for you. Our final thoughts We have enjoyed our visits each time we have come here, it’s always clean and tidy, never cluttered, so you can take your power chair here with no worries, the farm is doing its best to help disabled, and we are pleased to recommend a visit here for you. The produce is always good with a fair selection, we personally buy the fresh crusty bread and a few cheeses to enjoy with it. Outside there is a decent well looked after play area for children, plenty to amuse them, and there are farm animals to take them, ( or yourself, )  to see as well. An ideal Hour or so visit, so if touring around Stratford apon Avon, or Warwick area, why not pop in, and you will enjoy the countryside views anyway, this area is a delight for driving around.

This may be because sunset is the preferred time to go for the position of the sun and the way it lights up the Alhambra. At midday I was looking straight at the sun.  I went up on my mobility scooter from central Granada following the road that the bus takes. It was steep, rough because of the cobbles and hot in the midday sun. I enjoyed seeing lots of this old town area on the way. But, I’ll be getting the bus next time.  While up there, we had a drink at a restaurant on the nearby Plaza de San Nicolas. They brought out a small complementary plate of fried aubergine with honey which was delicious. We moved to another plaza for lunch which was the usual menu of Spanish food and I had the Tortilla which was pretty good. All of these places were accessed only by driving on cobbles.

1882,21455,Overview,4.5,"We have visited the zoo (Now WildHeart Animal Sanctuary) many times. I have visited whilst able bodied, in a wheelchair and using a mobility scooter. Whilst able bodied we paid the car park fee like everyone else. Once I became disabled and had a blue badge we decided to park across the road in the council car park which is free to badge holders. On our last visit, on exiting, we saw that the zoo car park is now free to Blue Badge holders, so one move in the right direction. There is a new entrance but it is still a steep slope and only one door was unlocked. It was not wide enough for either my chair or scooter (Which is average size) so it required someone to open the other door. This took some time. When paying for tickets, I wasn't asked for any documentation and have never been asked to show anything. But we do always carry this info with us. The zoo paths are as the other reviewers have described, broken concrete and deep gravel. In a wheelchair, a route around needs to be carefully planned. Some areas are too sleep or deep for someone to manage to push a wheelchair up or through. A scooter copes better but the deep gravel in the lion viewing area is far too deep even for Bessie (My scooter) However the lions can been seen around the other side which is where they normally hang out anyway. If they are on the rocks near the viewing area, they are high enough up to be able to see from a bit further back. Whilst most of the paths are manageable, don't expect a smooth ride. But some areas have been worked on so hopefully it will all get a makeover eventually. I agree that the fencing makes taking decent photos hard but this is the same whether standing or in a wheelchair as the fences are quite high (Thankfully) There is an indoor disabled toilet in the cafe. This gets used by anyone and everyone who is in the cafe. I used it once but it had a rather pungent smell that wasn't pleasant so I avoid if possible. There is another outside with the 'normal' toilets. This is also shared with baby changing but I've only had to wait once. The door doesn't close properly and I'm never quite sure if the lock actually works. The room is full of spiders, so I make my visits as brief as possible. I have some mobility so if I think I'm up to it I'll use the ladies toilets which are up 3 or 4 steps. Despite the zoo not being particularly wheelchair friendly, I always manage to see all the animals except the koi fish as the glass is always filthy and even standing up I'm not tall enough to see over the tank.

I was pleased to see another wheelchair-user on the pier crabbing with her family and friends (this is very popular there - you can hire buckets and lines to fish for crabs off the pier). The reasons I haven't given the access a higher rating is because it wasn't easy to take a look inside the lifeboat station at the end of the pier due to a high lip at the door, and because I I couldn't go onto the beach.   The beach is a fair way below the promenade/pier level and is mostly reached via steps.

When I gave my name I was told I was not on the list. (This although I had booked and pre-paid for my dinner). The waiter went to get their manager and then I was offered a seat. I accepted a seat in the garden. It was warm enough to sit outside for Christmas dinner. However, I then waited 30 minutes, before I caught the attention of one of the members of staff and asked why no one had come to serve me. I was informed they assumed I was waiting for someone. I explained I was on my own and that they could have asked me or checked my booking. In either way I would expect better service at a 5 star hotel as I would have expected at the least to have been offered a drink while I was waiting. After that service improved remarkably.

In the screens I've been to - 3 and 5 - the sound is much better. But the sound proofing is in adequate. Recently whilst watching Mary Poppins Returns there was a constant rumble from an adjoining screen showing some block buster.  Then let's talk about accessibility. Screens 3, 4 and 5 are accessible. They are not on ground level. But there is a wheelchair lift to take you down the equivalent of 10 steps. So far so good. But be warned, it is quite a walk to a disabled toilet on this lower level.  I first visited in November and refurbishment was still on going in the two upstairs screens. I assumed that to comply with accessibility requirements Reel would put in a lift to upstairs. Wrong! The two upstairs screens can only be accessed via the stairs. No good for me. (Ambulant disabled) Let alone someone in a wheelchair   I queried this when I visited. The young guy on duty was clearly embarrassed. ""I'm sorry sir. All I can suggest is you contact us beforehand and we'll let you know if the screen is accessible.""  Such a pity.

The townhouses were built around 1780, and are now category A listed buildings. In 1840, number 19 was redesigned to become the headquarters of the Caledonian  Insurance company, and this is used today as the main entrance into the hotel, with its original stone carved name proudly on display as you enter the hotel. (Photo 2). During 1939 they sold their premises to the George hotel, who had bought no,s 21 and 23 in 1860, then expanded over the next few years. In 2009 it was voted the best hotel in Edinburgh, after being taken over by the principle hotel company, then sold on to Intercontinental hotels in 2018. The hotel stands on George Street, an up class area of Edinburgh. The first view of the hotel was very attractive with shrubs and flowers in many flower boxes. (Photo 1). The entrance is on the level (photo 2), with its old original sign as an Insurance company. We were greeted by two very friendly members, the manager and receptionist, (photo 4) and invited to sit in the reception lounge while drinks were ordered.(photo 3).   COVID 19 restrictions prevented us from certain areas, so an incomplete review. From the reception lounge onward, it is all steps (photo 5) so only someone with a bit of mobility would be able to use the facilities, and that’s sad, because it certainly looks a very nice hotel but we are deprived of being able to see it all.. The hall led us along to an elegant restaurant (photo 6)  and next to this was “The Printing Press bar and dining room, (photo 7) and we enjoyed a very nice lunch (8).

I asked why it wasn’t done when we paid and why can’t someone just allow the children on a ride and a staff member bring us the passes. That would be positively discriminatory ifwe give you the passes before seeing proof that the children are disabled. A child in a big adapted wheelchair and a child using a walking frame and the receipts from gaining access as carers were obviously not enough. After that hiccup 🙄 the rest of the day was brilliant. The staff put the girls on first on al the rides and even one where they would’ve had to use their feet to press peddles in a police car they even had a special police car the staff pushed them around the track in. We didn’t have any problem getting around anywhere even with the mobility equipment (apart from a metal crunching crash when the girls collided while racing down a slope in the Trafford centre afterward lol I had taken my daughter to the changing places toilet at the Trafford centre on the way in as I didn’t know they had one inside Legoland so I cannot comment on the cp facility.

There was no obvious disabled parking bays at the visitors centre at the entrance so my dad dropped us off and parked in the car park. Inside the centre there were security checks and toilets. Before watching a short film about the history of Mount Vernon and George Washington we had a look at the miniature replica of the house and the stained glass windows (see photos). After the film we walked outdoors to George Washington’s house(see photos).It was busy and we had to queue before getting inside the house. Despite it being April it was a little chilly. The ground floor level is wheelchair accessible but the upper floors were not. As a consolation there was a little booklet with pictures showing the contents and use of the upper floors. After viewing the house we could have gone to Washington’s tomb but decided not to as it was quite a distance away and the weather was still a little cold. Instead we went to see the slave quarters. It was wheelchair accessible and all the information boards where low enough to read (see photos). Then we went back to the visitors centre where there was lots of information ( in different formats eg text, audio and visual) about George Washington and his life from birth to death.  Inside the visitors centre fast food was available and the dining area was wheelchair accessible. We had pizza 🍕. There is also a spacious large accessible gift shop. Although there were a few inaccessible areas and parts we didn’t go to the visit was very interesting and well done. If you are interested in American history it is definitely the place for you.

They told us that they've tried several mobility scooters on the site but they couldn't cope with the steepness of the site, but they were still looking. Even getting to the house is hard going, as is the terrace and upper gardens. There is no wheelchair access to the upper floor of the house, and numerous steps make even the ground floor tricky. The shop and restaurant (easy access in a wheelchair) are on a level with the entrance and loos.

We booked an accessible room and gave them advance notice that a wheelchair user would be staying. Unfortunately whilst the lift at the disabled entrance worked well the doors to the hotel were all locked and unbeknown to us the bell for disabled customers to ring to notify staff that they had arrived was out of order. We waited half an hour in the wind and rain - we eventually called reception and they sent someone 15 minutes later. We also had difficulty exiting the building- the door was simply too heavy for us to open and there were no staff available to help. One of our party had to go to the concierge desk - they eventually came round to help.   We spoke to the Duty Manager and he could not have cared less. He said the doors had been closed because of the poor weather and had no explanation for why the broken bell had not been fixed or why there wasn’t a sign saying it wasn’t working. A couple (not wheelchair users) also tried to use the entrance and he seemed more concerned with them and their experience.

At first, I thought it was a great spot as there wasn't a lot of people around and there was a retractable tape barrier around the accessible area. Once we got positioned we realised the balcony railing was right across our eye-level which meant we couldn't see the stage. This was very frustrating. We had to bend our necks down to see under the railing, which I couldn't do as it hurt my neck too much.

All floors are level access and accessible by a lift. You need a key card to use the lift which you can get from the bouncers. It's good that they have a key card because it stops able-bodied people from using the lift.  In the club rooms it can get very crowded on club nights so I tend to just sit in one place. It's difficult to drive through the crowds without running over someone.

2890,328,Transport & Parking,2.5,"Whilst there was ample parking for disabled badge holders, there was no lines on the car park, which meant there was no guarantee of space being kept for the wheelchair on return. Whilst there were examples of cars parked rather close to other cars, fortunately for me my space was near the edge of the car park, however had I been further into the parking, I could envisage some major problems getting back into the car.  It was a long walk from the disabled parking to the main entrance as the full length of the parking had a physical barrier, therefore you'd have to leave the disabled parking, and then double back and walk the equivalent of the full length of the car park in the opposite direction to reach the entrance gates. So whilst a car can be parked as little as 40 metres from the entrance, you would have to walk 180 metres to get from there to the entrance.

2896,13396,Access,4.5,"Just the fact that someone has bothered to build ramp access up to the static caravan is a fantastic start, because a lot of the trouble with camping for people with impaired mobility is not being able to clamber up into campervans or get up from the floor of tents. But with this place you can stay in the caravan and come and go just like everyone else.   Indeed, in some ways what you get is better than everyone else: one of the staff members told me he thought the accessible caravan is the nicest one on the park, because it's been adapted from a rather tightly-packed three-bedroom caravan to one with two bigger bedrooms and a bigger bathroom, so it's more spacious and comfortable for the visitors. Also, it's in a great location on the edge of the caravan park so the views from some of the windows are straight across the fields to the mountains.  The bathroom has a loo with rails and a shower with a (non-wobbly) wheeled shower seat and hose you can hold. The kitchen was also reasonably spacious for a caravan, and I was able to do some washing up sitting sideways on my scooter.  Almost every other building in the Glen Nevis Holidays complex was accessible too, including the neighbouring bar and restaurant and the supermarket in the campsite down the road. The only slight shame was that the laundry room on the self-catering park had a big step up to it so I couldn't go in.  One more thing to recommend: there's a mile-long accessible path along the river opposite the self-catering park (cross the bridge near the youth hostel), so you can even get properly out into the countryside with your scooter or wheelchair.

The corridors to the accessible rooms were lengthy with several doors. The lighting seemed rather low in these areas.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible room we visited had a slight threshold which was tricky for me as a powerchair user but possible fine for other wheelchair users.  Once in the room it was bright and light with plenty of lighting. There was room to pull alongside the bed and a space to turn in the room.  The accessible bathroom was a wet room. Getting into the bathroom required negotiating a mini ramp which for me was not the greatest experience due to the tightness of the ninety degree turn that had to be made.

It’s an old building so corridors were a little narrow.  My room door was a standard size and not widened for a wheelchair, also an old fashioned key access which was a little high. Once inside the room was pretty spacious, as we had twin beds there wasn’t a lot of room for a wheelchair between them due to the sofa bed.  I’m sure the staff would have moved it if asked.  An important point was lack of plug sockets. Only two in the room which were located on the wall opposite the beds, no USB ports.  Luckily I always have an extension cable in my bag (I use an oxygen concentrator and CPAP machine overnight) and a power pack for my phone - I need it beside me in case of an emergency.  The room did have a flashing fire alarm, but I was never asked if I needed assistance in an emergency and there wasn’t a escape plan on my door.  My room was next to the fire exit however.

I was very disappointed leaving the restaurant, they had put an extra table covering most of the back entrance/exit doors (the wheelchair accessible one next to the disabled parking). I had to ask another customer to move and I scraped along the door.

3369,47797,Overview,5.0,"Room 204 has a wet room and, like almost all accessible rooms at Premier Inn it is a good size with plenty of room for a wheelchair user to move about freely. Width of main door: 86cm. The room is located on the ground floor of a separate block from where the reception is and the automatic door to that block is operated by placing you room key card on the sensor.  The king size bed was made up of two single zip and lock beds and, at a height of 49cm it was okay for my wife to transfer from her wheelchair. The mattress was comfortable enough, and two firm pillows and two softer pillows were available to us.   The window looked out to a hedgerow, which helped to block out the traffic noise from the M5, just over 200 metres beyond it. The outer double glazed window could be opened to a degree, which afforded us with fresh air but, when closed along with the secondary sliding window meant there was no noise from outside to be heard The blackout curtains were effective, plunging the room into darkness. The A/C comes from a standalone wall-mounted unit, effectively cooling the room to 19ºC. The fan was quiet with the only noise to be heard from it being the draining of the excess water.  There were enough electrical sockets around the room but none at the sides of the bed; this wasn’t a particular problem for us but could be troublesome for a guest that needs to plug in a CPAP device or other essential device during the night.  I’m sure though that the hotel would be able to provide an extension cable. The basic Wi-Fi was weak, with a few dropouts. Our mobile data (O²) was weak.  As is common with most of the hotels in this chain, the accessible bathroom was a good size, with a sliding door that opened to a width of 82cm.  The thermostatic shower was easy to control and the water pressure was very good; it remained at a constant temperature whilst showering. We often find that the shower area in PI wet rooms doesn’t have a shelf on which to place shampoo, body wash and so on.  It can be very difficult for a disabled person, when seated, to reach necessary items when the floor is the only place to put them. This shower did have a soap dish, so half marks for that, but a bigger shelf is needed. The bathroom though was showing signs of wear and tear; the shower seat was well past its sell-by date and my wife found it to be very uncomfortable.  I would describe the room as being in the old style with a couple of additions, such as the large screen TV with the HDMI input socket below. It was pleasing that the room still had the old style wardrobe unit, which we prefer to the ones in the updated rooms; it offers more storage capacity.  The room also lacked the vanity mirror of the newer rooms, which is always set too high for a wheelchair user.  One major problem in this room is the height of the coat hooks which, at 168cm from the floor are totally useless for a wheelchair user; see photograph.  This problem could be easily rectified; they are fixed to a wooden panel, which could be lowered to the appropriate height. Take note management!   The hotel only has a breakfast room, which we did not use.  There is though a Toby Inn, which is not affiliated to the hotel, next door and within walking distance; we didn’t use that either.

I was feeling nervous about mixing with people at an event like this but the Covid safe system that the staff employed, along with being in a tent and having an open air dance area, made me feel as reassured as I could have been at a public event.   Capacity was limited and distancing was maintained around tables but this didn't affect the atmosphere at all and actually made it better for our party.

3435,38349,Overview,3.0,"The main entrance to Temple of Boom has a step in the door, so wheelchair access is via the entrance used for vehicles. This entrance is a large archway, with double gates shutting it off from the public. The door through this gate has a step in it, but remains open so that someone can step through and open for me (if a member of staff hasn’t got to it first, which is unusual). The pavement outside Temple of Boom is poorly maintained, with potholes and uneven kerbs, but this pavement is not owned by Temple of Boom.  Once through the gate, there is a short slope into the main courtyard.  On the right is the bar and toilets. There is a concrete ramp into this building, and double doors plenty wide enough to allow a wheelchair through. An accessible toilet is available, complete with grab rails and emergency cords, but full changing facilities are unfortunately not included. The key to this toilet can be obtained from members of staff, who are all very friendly and accommodating.  On the left is the room where events (concerts, wrestling shows etc.) takes place. There are two entrances; one has a small lip down into a narrow corridor which is surpass-able in a wheelchair, but if preferred the goods entrance is more accessible, with level access and a wider doorway. Food can be purchased from a bar in this room.  There are several nearby carparks with disabled parking spaces, and quite a few bus stops available in the area for travel.

It has one of those curtains made of plastic strips, but one end is left clear (which I only noticed after struggling through the strands of plastic). Once inside, all of the various stall are accessible from a wheelchair. Some of the counters are slightly high in places. Unbelievably, there is lift access to the top floor. Sadly the ramp to get on the bottom of the lift is  way too steep for comfort & not for the faint of heart, but once you're up it's fine.

3517,13941,Overview,4.0,"This is a delightful half days visit through beautiful scenic woodland and open pastures, and a trip that a disabled person can manage and enjoy.  We Start the trip in the small town of Kinver which lies in South Staffordshire, in the district of Stourbridge.  The earliest record is found in a charter of 736ad, and it’s present church dates from the 12th century. It’s High Street was laid out in the late 13th century, while it’s main  Pub, the White Hart dates back to the 14th century.  KINVER was known for its sturdy woolen cloth, and it was also a stop on the road from Chester to Bristol, where the White Hart benefitted by the passing trade route. The river was used to power Slitting mills during the mid 1600,s, and with these mills they Slit bars of Iron into rods to be made into nails. Sadly these mills closed by about 1892. There is a local story, but completely unfounded, that the family of Dick Whittington lived here in the area.  We then moved across to Kinver Edge, with its broadleaved woodland, famous now for its landmark of the rock caves, carved into the sandstone, and lived in until the 1960,s, some of them restored to show us how they lived in the 1930,s, where at one time 11 families lived here. The caves date back to the 18th century, believed   to be used as a home from 1770.  An able bodied person can walk up the hill to the caves to see its gardens, orchard, and allotments, now being restored, and there is a tea room and toilets, with an outdoor seating area.   Sadly, for those of us disabled, there is no way we can get up to see them, but the paths around the hill allows us a chance to see the rock face, as our photo shows.  Now though, we can enjoy Kinver woods, sometimes called the Royal Forest, with almost 19 acres of wood containing many broadleaved trees, such as Birch, Oak, and Sweet chestnut. To the South you will find coniferous woodland.  In 1917 almost 19 acres of these woods were given to the National Trust, and it now has a circular path, but not really ideal for disabled people at the moment. All in all, some 200 acres of land, with 40 or so miles of footpaths and bridleways cover the area and surrounding countryside, and here you may see Adders, Common Lizards, Badgers and the Red fox.  It truly is a beautiful woodland, and we wish to now offer you our review, to see if we can encourage you to go and see for yourself this delightful area. We hope you will enjoy your trip, but if you feel you will not be able to travel that far, why not read our review, and if you like it, please tick the “I like “ button, which may encourage others to read the review and consider taking the trip.   KINVER is a small town in the area of Stourbridge, (photo 1). It has just one small street, but a nice place to start, and it may draw you to want to see some of the small shops, and a few coffee shops. The Clock Tower attractively stands by Kinver drive (photo 2) which leads up to Kinver church.  Just on the edge of the street is a small tea room, which looks inviting , a Miss Marple tea room. (photo 3).  A short drive away , we parked in the one disabled bay, to admire the woodlands  (photo 4)  it is possible to get a view of the famous Kinver Edge rock, (photo 5) and it’s old inhabited sandstone caves. Unfortunately it is impossible for a disabled person to get up to the caves. KINVER woods is an ancient woodland of an unknown date, (many speculate of course) with many a pathway of hard compressed soil, so on a dry day an ideal friendly route for us. The middle path (photo 6)  allows a short walk to another car park that your carer could perhaps easily manage for you.  The Autumn colours were just beginning to show their beauty at this next car park (photo 7) on an early November day. Depending on how you both feel, it is possible  to attempt another mile or so to the next car park, (photo 8) or return to pick your car up at the first car park, then make the journey by car on a scenic narrow lane to  the car park (photo 9). The next car park is along this lane with easy access into the woods (photo 10). From here you can return to the first car park if you attempted the ride, a scooter or powerchair will manage this quite well, (photo 11) and again the photo shows quite a level hard core path.  Our final thoughts Very enjoyable few hours, starting off in Kinver with perhaps a coffee break at one of the very few “watering holes” On a dry day a ride through Kinver will raise your spirits, as these woods are delightful whatever the time of year.",kinver edge and the rock houses stourbridge,positive,1,1

A major bonus was the tour given by a man who had actually lived in one of the traditional houses there as a child in the 1970s and early 1980s, and he told us all about local customs, food and drink - even offering round samples of poteen, the potent Irish moonshine. As far as access goes, it was a bit tight at the entrance/shop area, but I was easily able to get into everywhere else on the site on my small scooter. There were wheelchair-accessible loos in the village site and the snack bar across the car park that were both a bit tatty but big and clean, and a highlight of the visit was that my scooter coped OK with the path across the beautiful sand dunes near the museum.

The Rumblin' Tum is really accessible as the entrance is flat from the street. There's 2 car parks almost opposite the cafe with 3 disabled spaces in one of the car parks and also at least 1 disabled space in the other. The car park is free & you use your disabled badge in your car whilst using the disabled bays.  When we visited the tables nearest the counter were available but I would advise to phone up to book one of these tables if you are in a wheelchair cause I wouldn't have been able to easily get to any other tables (without asking other people to stand up and move their tables/chairs) due to the space. The staff are friendly and moved the chairs so that I could have a space for me & my wheelchair at the table.  The meals are very well priced especially for the area & portions are really big! First time we visited I ordered a sandwich & salad plus a side(bowl) of chips & curry sauce although I should have just got it as a small side! The second time I visited I ordered the chicken burger & chips. Plus I ordered a coffee & walnut cake to takeaway. Both times the food was delicious! And it was only about 10 minutes for the food to be served and it wasn't too quiet either. If you don't wish to eat in you can order to takeaway! There aren't any disabled toilets in the cafe but there are public toilets right next to the car park, almost opposite the cafe (opposite the McColl's shop); there is one disabled toilet accessed using a radar key(I bought mine from my local council).

4215,24124,Access,4.0,"It is recommended you book a time-slot in advance to climb the o2 (dome times you can also find discounts online, or combination tickets with other attractions). If walking over the o2, you require to be able to walk unaided, without a walking aid, and be relatively fit. (I am relatively fit, and still thought it was a fairly steep climb, though you can rest as you need to). It is also at a height, and you are exposed to whatever the weather conditions are on the day. You can't really carry personal belongings, phones or small cameras must be carried in a pocket which can zip. Small medication eg inhalers, can be carried, you're advised to let the climb guide know if you need anything like this.  Glasses and hearing aids which are worn securely are allowed (check they are secure!!) There are lockers where you can leave your belongings. I would also say you need to be able to follow instructions - you are attached by climbing rope at all times while climbing, but you are responsible for threading this along the route. You go up with a group of people, there are Guides, who were great, and they really kept an eye that everyone was OK.  But, they also do wheelchair climbs! I didn't see this happening. They have a special wheelchair for the climb, their staff are not allowed to help you transfer into this, but they have a hoist so if you/your carers can use this. You need to bring your own sling. They also have a large changing room with changing plinth.  You can book for one person doing wheelchair climb but up to 9 friends/family can also book to walk at the same time (1 carer place is  included in that number, the carer is free).  The person in the wheelchair will be taken on the climb with four 02 guides, who use a pulley system.

Each evening, between 5pm and 9pm, the moat of the Tower of London is illuminated with thousands of individual flames in an act of rememberance. The Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) light the first flame and then a team of volunteers light the rest of the flames, During the ceremony music is played, a new choral work, with words from War Poet Mary Borden’s Sonnets to a Soldier. The display ends at 9pm each evening.  There are 2 ways to view the event. Firstly there are tickets which provide access to the moat. These tickets are now sold out. There are excelllent access arrangements for people doing this and deserve 5 stars.  There is also free public viewing from Tower Hill and the Tower concourse, this is what I did on the Monday evening, and this is what I will comment about in my review. There appears to be no special arrangments for disabled people viewing from the free viewing points, as all people have to join the same queue.  UPDATE 08/11/2019:  I contacted the Tower of London to ask if they could improve the accessibility for people in the free viewing areas by allowing those who need it not to queue up. I would suggest asking a steward about accessibility if you are unable to stand in the queue. The next day they replied saying "" Thank you for your kind words and for providing us with such detailed feedback of your experience at the Tower Remembers. I have forwarded your message on to the event organiser so they can review this process for the remaining nights and future events. "" I hope this helps people who are visiting later this week.  UPDATE 13/11/2018:  Following on from contacting the Tower of London I received a 2nd email on 12/11/2018. This one was from their visitors' centre. Their reply was ""We learnt much from the incredible public response to it, which included huge numbers of people coming to Tower Hill to see it.  I am very sorry that you did not find the access area until later in your visit after you had queued. Stewards at the entrance to the queue barrier should have been looking for and telling people about the area.  We had some stewards specifically dedicated to doing this but the sheer volume meant that we missed you.  I can only apologise for this. I will certainly be feeding your experience into the review process for the project.""

We did hope to get into the garden, which the online guide says is wheelchair friendly. It may possibly be. But the access to the garden is over large  loose stone chippings, so we couldn't get through the gateway to find out.   Rollator also couldn't cope. Blue badge parking was by the entrance. Cafe and shop and courtyard were accessible. Outer  edge of courtyard has flagstoned path. However, this is partly obscured by tied open barn doors,  and as we negotiated around the doors we we got the wheelchair stuck in the loose chippings.   Disappointed, but at least we hadn't travelled far from our holiday accommodation.  ",house of dun garden and estate montrose,positive,1,1

The other point of note is that the bays aren’t marked out with lines are clear demarcation so beware of vehicles parking too close to you if you need wheelchair access to the doors of your vehicle.  I think it fair to warn people that Fort George is a place that does involve being able to walk or wheel some significant distances albeit with places to stop, rest a while and take in the view.

There is a revolving door which has stickers on it with symbols of a wheelchair user, persona with a mobility aid and a pram all with red crosses through them. While I see that they have done this pictorially so everyone can tell, as a disabled person, having the image that represents me crossed out feels a very negative way to tell me not to use the door. The accessible door which says it's automatic, has a sticker of a wheelchair user, two people, on with a walking stick, a parcel and a pram.  Then there is a small foyer which has a member of staff to assist and hand sanitisers . Then there is an automatic door into the main reception area.  Information desks are lower and there is a choice of chairs or sofa seating. Patients stay here until they are called through for their appointment.   I exited on the Grafton Road entrance, and I noticed that there is a small café area (sorry no photos as there were people sitting there). The Grafton Road entrance is also at ground level with no ramps. In front of this entrance is a large very spacious covered area which is very handy.

While I was walking up a man appeared in a golf buggy and offered to drive me up to the villa's entrance. He told me when I was ready to depart to make my way to the shop and ask them to call him and he would take me back down, which he did.  The villa is in the process of some renovations at the moment, so my review is how I found it in February 2020.  From the gift shop entrance there is another slope and then a small flight of stairs without handrail and a ramp to the villa. There is a manual door to enter the villa. This leads to an internal courtyard where there is a information desk, at standing height, to show your tickets and to collect the audio guide which is included in the admission price. The ground floor, cafe and toilets are on the ground floor and all are step free. There is nowhere to sit and rest apart from a few  benches in the central courtyard, some of these are very low but there are higher ones against the walls.    Upstairs is only accessible by stairs. There are 2 sets of stairs. Both only have a hand rail on the one side. One staircase is reasonably wide and the other is a spiral staircase, see photos. I think you were meant to go up the wider staircase and desend by the spiral staircase. However, I used the wider staircase both ascending and descending. Upstairs there is a small cinema, leading off the wider staircase. It's hear the top of the staircase and there is a single step into it. It has free standing chairs with back support. The film is in French with English subtitles. There are not as many grand rooms to see upstairs as some rooms have collections of china. The best thing about upstairs is the verandah which overlooks the gardens. Here there there is some seating.  The cafe is on the ground floor with step free access. It has free standing tables and chairs.   There is a door out to the French Garden. This is the largest garden with fountains and classical music show every 20 minutes. There are some steps or a ramp to access this part of the gardens. Off the main gardens are several smaller gardens which are only accessible by steps. Some of these steps have no handrail and are also warn down and uneven.

So when my train arrived I expected nobody to be there to meet me but I was wrong! Scotrail have never let me down when it comes to the staff! They helped me off the train and I was trying to get to the disabled parking bays quickly as I was meeting someone (I'll leave you to come to your own conclusions), and I got lost again but credit to the scotrail staff as there are always staff there who want to help you have the best start to your day. So a member of staff walked with me to the entrance door. The only criticism would be that there are not many drop down kerbs in the car park.   On my way back, I missed my train but I spoke to the staff who gave me options in order to get home. I ended up with a bleeding nose so one of the kind staff members got me a tissue, a glass of water and he also took me to the platform to wait for my train. I would say that the signs which tell you what platform you are at was too high and unless you want to strain your neck then it just better to guess.

This soon became apparent it was not able to cope with so much more railway expansions, and a further alteration had to be made, and work began in 1892. It was a Hugh task, now to cover 23 acres  of ground, and it included the new entrance from Waverley Bridge, which had started in the 1873 plans, and a new ridge and furrow system roof was built to lay as low as possible so it would not spoil the city,s skyline. Then the first and second class waiting rooms were built, ( but now, sadly due to the COVID 19 problems, the first class lounge has been closed during 2020/21, and it remains to be seen if it will be reopened. ) Finally, the new station was opened in 1921. Over the years further improvements have had to be made, (bearing in mind the Listed status now held ) so any work has to have Listed building consent. In 1994 the railway was privatised, and by 2004 new projects were put in place, including lengthening of the platforms, and between 2010/2020 the roofs glazing was replaced with 27,000 new panes of glass. (Photo3) It is now one of the largest of all British stations. After having wheelchair assistance to get us off the platform at Waverley station, and along to the concourse (photo 1) which is all on the level, but very busy although we found everyone very friendly and helpful, including a number of passers by, who were very nice in allowing us to move around very easily, and my wife pushed me along to the lift (photo 2). We then rode up and across Waverley stations glass roof,  (Photo 3) exiting we moved along the Bridge walkway, and a long push for my wife, which would take us eventually to the way out for Princess street, to Another lift (photo 4) which took us up to the level needed for Princess street. (Photo 5).  A paved walkway (photo 6) took us along to Princess street (photo 7). All the main bus stops are along here (photo 8) which lead to Edinburgh castle. (Photo 9), and we had quite a view to the castle itself (photo 10). Crossing over Princess street, there are a number of hotels and restaurants. (Photo 11).  Our final thoughts. We enjoyed the train ride to Waverley station, arriving on time, and assistant service was there waiting for us, who took us along past all other platforms, we had arrived at the far end platform, so a long push for wheelchair, but it was easily handled for us, and it was no trouble using a number of lifts to get us up onto Princess street, so overall, an interesting journey, and we would suggest that if you are going to Edinburgh, you consider using the train service, as we found it so convient.",edinburgh waverley railway station edinburgh,negative,0,1

4800,25855,Access,5.0,Access in and around the building:  The main entrance has a traditional revolving door. Alongside is a small ramp built into the entrance and a wide access door. It was easy to get through and a concierge was quickly on hand to hold the door.  Once in the building the reception is in front of you. There were plenty of staff on hand.  The building is on several floors. One of many lifts leads from reception to the upper floors. My powerchair is quite large at 68 cm wide and 116 cm in length so I used the service lift – not that I knew it was a service lift until later.  The wide corridors to the accessible bedrooms were amazing. Once had enough space for a seating area and a piano! Apparently this stems for from the days of ladies in the grand ball gowns not wishing to touch another lady’s gown as they swept along the corridor to the grand staircase.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible bedroom was a surprise in that the door opened to reveal so much space. The room door had a clearance of 86 cm so plenty of room to wheel in.  There were no tight corners and tricky turns to be done here! With access to both sides of the beds and a large seating area it was great.  The accessible wet room was spacious and had a door the same size as the room door; again no tight turns. With an integral shower and plenty of space around the toilet it worked well for me.  The two accessible rooms are identical.   Access in the dining area:  The hotel offers several items for dining or getting light refreshments. Peacock Alley offers a lounge style area where you can relax and admire the old station architecture or just watch the gentle movement of the station clock as time ticks away.  The adjacent Brassiere provides breakfast and other dining options during the day. The hotel’s Pompadour restaurant offers fine dining and great views. I visited all three during my visit and they were all easy to get in and move around. Furniture could be moved to make access easier and the staff were magnificent.  Access to other facilities:  The hotel does have a spa and swimming pool. I ventured down to visit these and whilst not going as far as swimming I can confirm that there is an accessible changing room!,waldorf astoria the caledonian edinburgh,positive,1,0

I had my crutches with me as I can't walk very far at all without sitting down, but the staff lent me a wheelchair and let us park further down where the boardwalk starts.   The very first birds we saw included 3 beautiful male Bullfinches and 1 female, Blue, Great and Marsh tits, Greenfinches, Chaffinches, Goldfinches, Goldcrests and Nuthatches.  The reserve is an enchanting mix of woodland, marshland, rivers, dykes and reeds. It truly is a beautiful place and I can't wait to go back as soon as possible.

5068,44851,Overview,4.0,South side Scran  The Southside Scran (see photo) opened in a December 2018. We went at the end of January. The bistro is wheelchair accessible. Inside the dining areas are on split levels. We sat at a table that was at pavement level. It was tucked around the corner and so away from any drafts from the entrance door. We were lucky as there were only a few other customers in that particular area and so it was relatively easy to move the wheelchair around. If there had been people on the  surrounding tables it might have been a little tight for space.  The lower dining area is approximately 4 steps down. I am not sure if they have a ramp which would allow access to wheelchair users. I would suggest that when booking it would probably be best to ask for a table that is at pavement level. The food was delicious (see photos) and the staff were lovely and helpful. There is a disabled toilet near the entrance. We drove to the bistro and parked just outside after the bus stop.we went on a Thursday evening but it may be more difficult at different times of the day and different days of the  week.

Once in the room there was plenty of space to wheel in, move around and get alongside the bed.  The bathroom was accessible and included a bath not a wet room. There were plenty of grab handles and it was well laid out. Obviously, not suited to everyone having just a bath. It was spacious enough for me to be able to wheel and turn a full 360-degree circle.

He offered to help find something more appropriate. 5 minutes later and guided all the way we were handed over to even more helpful staff and shown to seats at the back of the auditorium at stalls level. My new  rollator folds closed and was able to stay at the side of my seat but the lady would have kept it safely for me if I'd needed to.

Each entrance is level access but I felt the ground was a little bumpy whilst going around the back near the garden plants.  Outside in the garden section I found the width of the aisles to be okay for my wheelchair however, inside in certain areas the aisles were quite difficult to get around. Especially in one section where more fragile items were on sale including candle holders, lanterns and vases. I didn’t buy anything whilst I was there so I cannot comment on the height of the tills.  I visited the café whilst at Brechin Castle Garden Centre, it was my first time eating out since the second lockdown and I was a little nervous. We sat outside though, the tables were nicely spaced out and at a good height for a wheelchair user.

5411,39946,Overview,4.0,"Cowley, recorded in the Doomsday book, simply means “cow pasture” and it stood by the river Churn, which runs past lakes in the Manor before joining the river Thames a lot further down river. A church, which stands in the grounds, was built in the 13th century, along with an old manor, both becoming the property of the Dean and chapter of Westminster, after King Henry V111 got rid of the Abbey that stood here.  In 1695 a Manor House was built, and over the years has been in the care of many tenants, until the church gave the lease over to a Mr James Hutchinson, who in 1850, using stone from the old house, built a new house on the site, now part of the present building. He then built the Victorian water garden and its cascade. The Cowley Manor we see today was the work of Sir James Horlick, (of Horlick Malt) who extended the house and laid out the grounds.  It is believed that Lewis Carroll visited the village of Cowley quite often, using the grounds as part of his Alice in wonderland story. If this is so, then maybe that’s why the hotel as we see it today, is regarded as being rather quirky and different, it’s certainly is so as you look around. After the Second World War, the property fell into disrepair, and remained so until bought in 1999 by Peter and Jessica Frankopan, who then restored the manor. This was the first of their four hotels they own as part of “A curious group of Hotels” and a different hotel it looks , with 31 bedrooms standing in 55 acres of grounds with grade 11 gardens.  OUR REVIEW OF COWLEY MANOR. Situated in the hamlet of Cowley, which holds a few houses of typical warm Cotswold yellow stones along its winding lane, your journey here will begin when you arrive at a picturesque tree lined impressive gateway and drive, (photo 1) with many species of trees from around the world, and moving along, over to your left, you pass the first of the small lakes, Lodge lake (photo 2) and the river Churn, leading ahead to the next lake, the Boat house lake, with its bank of well tended grassy slopes (3) before turning a corner to arrive at the old Cowley Manor (4).  Towards the front entrance (5) you pass the car park, and just two disabled bays in the corner, and then you have a small step to get up before you can enter the hotel.  We were greeted at a highly unusual reception area, (6) which would thereafter highlight the quirky hotel we were about to see, and this led us into a very shall we say, more modern and different bar area, colourful to say the least (7). We found it difficult to describe the main lounge (8),  bare, yet holding its own character, but we did enjoy a very nice cup of coffee (9).  Beyond, a pleasant wooden staircase and hallway (10) guided the way into what we assumed was the library (11) and then a games room (12). The last room past the reception, we enter the breakfast room (13) with pale Ash wood panels, which provides a continental breakfast included in the cost of your room, but you pay extra for any type of hot meal you would like. Now we don’t know why it’s a popular hotel, we are working on that, but it was certainly well booked, and although we requested a few days before if we could join them for breakfast, they sadly had to decline our request because of being so full at that time of the week.  If the weather holds promise on your day here, you may wish to enjoy breakfast on the small terrace area, (14) overlooking the third of the lakes, still fed by the river Churn, known as Upper lake, home to a few ducks. Now this is a very dog friendly hotel, your canine friends may join you wherever you  want, and there were certainly a lot of well behaved owners guiding their pets around the grounds, and actually this was nice to see, for it is a delightful park to walk around.  The only way a disabled person could get around the grounds, was to leave by the reception area, and down that small step, and the first building you see is the old Anglican St Mary’s church of the 1200,s restored in 1872, (15) with dressed limestone, Ashlar Cotswold stone tower and chancel, with a stone slate roof, now a  grade 11 historical building.  Across from the car park is the level compressed path for the gardens, (16) lined with  many decorative trees and shrubs, leading down to the third pool, (17) which is held back by the impressive wall of the decorative carved frontage of the cascade below, and  gratefully, in use today (18) running on down into a small pool (19) before reaching the pool beyond, and from up here, we had our last view of the unusual and quirky Cowley Manor (20).  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS. What can we say, other than different, glad to have seen the hotel and grounds, but it’s not for us, but it has its supporters, so don’t mock it, but we are pleased to say that it is at least a very dog friendly hotel, and it’s welcoming, and many families were enjoying with their canine friends the hospitality and freedom to roam and run. If you are into a different style of furnishing then you will enjoy your stay, ( do take a look at the many websites offering room deals here so as to note the way each room is furnished ) but it is wonderfully landscaped with long walks available.

5733,51092,Overview,1.5,"The only reason for 2 stars only, is because of the difficulty to get to the Spa building, but otherwise it is a very lovely place to take advantage of this quiet Spa and pool building. Sadly the Spa is not disabled friendly unless you can manage a longish walk along a path of chippings,  as pushing a wheelchair would be very difficult, but we include the review here which may benefit your family members while visiting this lovely old medieval hotel.  The Spa is set in its own area, situated in enchanting gardens and delightful pools, and 26 acres of woodland walks and pasture land. With its modern facilities of a large swimming pool, sauna, hot tub, steam room, and modern Gym, it still manages to hold its charm and elegance, and blends in well with the medieval hotel itself, which is surrounded by open spaces and woodland walks, first introduced as a hunting lodge in the 13th century, now with 26 acres for you to wander through, taking along your canine companion in this dog friendly hotel.  A delightful well maintained Moat surrounds this hotel (photo 1) and a paved pathway from the car park, (photo 2) leads towards the hotels main entrance, (photo 3) which is on the flat, then a double door awaits you to pull open. This leads you to the hotel reception, and a hallway (photo 4) which will lead to the separate Spa building.  The path crosses the moat (photo 5).   After going out of the hotel, you have to go down half a dozen steps (photo 6)  and there is no ramp available, and a long hard slog would await the carer to pull you over the deep chippings. Sadly, even though the Spa is set in beautiful settings and a lovely old building, (photo 7) we cannot recommend this for disabled people.  For an able bodied companion, there is a very attractive large swimming pool available (photo 8) and a hot tub., as well as a sauna. The Gym has a good selection of equipment including weights (photo 9) and treadmills (photo 10). To cool off after your training, there are delightful woodland walks (photo 11) passing many lovely pools, which lead to pasture lands (photo 12).  Our final thoughts Sadly, not for a disabled person, as far to difficult to reach the Spa and pool, steep steps, heavy going dragging you across chippings that pass a lovely little pond, nicely laid out area, and wonderful woodland walks.  So we cannot in any way recommend the Spa to you. (BUT DO SEE OUR REVIEW OF NEW HALL HOTEL AS THIS IS A DELIGHTFUL HOTEL IN ITSELF)   ",new hall hotel spa sutton coldfield,negative,0,1

This recently-opened hostel has step-free access to all areas, with good-quality bathrooms for its accessible rooms and clean, spacious accessible loo in the dining room area. The real winner for me is always when I manage to find a family room with accessible bathroom.  During the day, you can visit the landscape discovery centre side of the building, which has a shop selling souvenirs, outdoor clothes and local maps, activity rooms, a lunchtime cafe and a green roof with a rooftop nature walk.  There are a couple of reasons I haven't given this five stars, though. The first is that we couldn't get a room with accessible bathroom on the first night of our stay, as it turns out that the accessible rooms aren't necessarily reserved for disabled people - they're also popular with families because they have five beds and an en suite bathroom. I went ahead with an ordinary room for just the one night, but the loo was hard work without rails.  The other thing is that when we did move into our accessible room for the rest of our stay, we loved it but I did wonder how it would work in there for someone using a larger wheelchair, because there was a point in the bed layout which was quite tight to get through even with my small three-wheeled rollator walker.",yha the sill at hadrians wall hexham,positive,1,0

The entrances door and internal doors were all level access and wide. There were no unexpected thresholds or lumps and bumps to get over. The three bedrooms were all large enough to wheel into and the 'dedicated' accessible room was great. It had twin automatic profiling style beds, a fabulous ceiling hoist covering the beds, the bedroom space, and on into the wet room. There was plenty of space - we had two wheelchair users in the room at one point with bags of room.   The main hall links the rooms and was wide, bright and light' the natural finish of the timber adding much to the atmosphere. The main wet room was large enough for a 'party' and it was great to discover a Closomat loo! The other bathroom was equally spacious and conventionally fitted. That said, I was able to wheel in and could use the loo and hand basin easily if I wanted to.  The main lounge had plenty of windows with great views and a doorway out to the veranda. You had a choice of dining tables in that you could sit out and enjoy the view from the veranda or opt to sit inside around the large wooded table. The kitchen was integral to the room but with so much space it felt quite natural. With dropped counter, mobile units, knee space under the cocker and the sink as well as lowered oven it offered everything I'd be looking for as a wheelchair user if I decided to have a Jamie Oliver moment!

On the first they denied that an ambilift existed and insisted that I was manually lifted onto the plane. On the return journey just one day later, the lift appeared!   Arrivals: The staff came to collect me from the plane and immediately started grabbing and pushing my chair without asking or saying anything to me. I had to grab the wheels and hold firm for quite a while before they agreed to let go. They were also very cross that I wanted to carry my bag, even though this was something I am perfectly capable of. The staff grabbed the bag anyway, and squashed some of the contents. Not thrilled! Once they had taken me through the secure area where assistance is required, they disappeared without a word.   Departures: I was sitting saying goodbye to my German friend at the check in area a full two hours before departure and the desk staff called me over to say I was late for my flight and I had not let them know I was here. I asked to go through by myself and they kept telling me I must wait for assistance staff. They kept trying to take away my boarding pass which is on my mobile phone so I didn't want this taken away to an unknown place by unknown people for an unknown purpose. After some back and forth of them telling me I was not allowed to go alone through security, that someone had to come and ""drop me"" (a scary prospect!) they came and took me through security, even though this area was perfectly accessible. Again, they grabbed at my bags and pushed my chair without asking until I refused to go anywhere until they stopped. He eventually let go of my chair but made off with my bags. Straight after security is where you have to be taken out through a side door to avoid the steps, so they could have waited here for me to give assistance. You are taken out through one door and in through another and then it's all accessible again, but the assistance people won't be leaving you alone!!

Probably designed to avoid the wind and rain on a more dreich day.  The entrance is a wall of glass but having automatic doors you quickly see where to go. Heading inside the space is large and cave like. I did find the lighting in places to be a bit dull but soon cottoned on to the idea of just follow the crowds!  Getting tickets and sorting out the best way around was soon resolved at the ticket desk. The staff were quick to describe what was on offer and the order in which to see things. Very quickly, once I said I was visually impaired, an audio guide was produced and the staff showed me the buttons and described how it worked. With guide in hand I was all set to explore.   The exhibition was first and was set out so you followed the line of cabinets, pictures and displays, following the audio guide as you went. Part way round you had the option to pop into the theatre space and watch the film expand on the story of Culloden.   The lighting around the exhibits at times was the brightest but that probably to preserve the exhibits. Getting toward the end of the exhibition you come in to a large more open space and there are doors to go out in to the battlefield.  Once outside on the battlefield it was a little easier in so far as there were two lines of troops. These lines were depicted by the fluttering flags of the English and Scottish armies. The paths were clearly defined and easy to follow. Every so often there were plaques describing things, stones marking clan graves, and other features.

There was a revolving door and an accessible entrance next to it. When I arrived I got  manual wheelchair from a number which are near to the entrance.  On my visit I stayed on the ground floor visiting the Frida Kahlo exhibition and restaurant. The entire route was step free. Getting to the exhibition involved going through the gift shop, the aisles were wide enough but it was busy.  The Frida Kahlo exhibition was very popular and sold out on the day we visited. The exhibition focuses on her as a person and her image with a collection of personal artefacts and clothing. There is only a small display of her art work. We had timed admission and there was no queue when we arrived. The exhibition was laid out in a series of rooms. The first was a long, straight corridor with paintings and photographs on both sides of the walls. The exhibits were at standing height but the labels were at a lower level which was perfect for me in a wheelchair. The other rooms had items on the walls plus display cabinets which were at wheelchair user height. I'm glad I used a wheelchair to get around as there was no fixed seating inside the exhibition. Frida Kahlo was a disabled artist and one of the rooms focuses on her health and disability. On display is her prosthetic leg, decorated corsets which she wore after her operations and an assortment of medication. There are several photos that includes Frida's wheelchair. Interestingly when I was in this room people were very aware of my wheelchair and proactive about moving to let me see the exhibits, while in the other rooms both before and after I was often invisible.  At the exit there are manual doors but a member of the public was there and opened the door for me. Exiting via the gift shop there were two unmarked slopes, both of which caught me by surprise and I nearly needed up rolling into members of the public.

Being old fashioned and a bit of a traditionalist, the Gallery it’s contents and exhibitions were not my cup of tea, though I was surprised and inspired by much of what I saw, experienced and able to appreciate. The NG of Scotland have made a really big statement on inclusion and accessibility by opening on this DAD a fully equipped Changing Places toilet to compliment their other disabled access facilities. The former John Watson School for girls is large, spacious and well laid out over 3 floors, the ground and upper being divided into halls and rooms for exhibits of paintings, sculpture and laid out works.  On the ground floor usage is made of the corridors as exhibit space leading to a well provisioned, well stocked shop, sales of exhibitors work   and accessible resource areas - this is where the PAMIS sensory storytelling took place.The lower floor is where the toilets are located and a wide accessibility cafe, there are lockers, a buggy and chair area available. The catering provision is Heritage Portfolio so the standards, range of foods of quality and service are high, as was the case. Overall a popular venue for its large outdoor areas, water features and it’s packed events guide throughout the seasons and the year. The cafe and the Gallery were populated by children of all ages and stages and there programmes for younger one and those a bit Oder that are learning, experiential and thought provoking.

6361,25250,Overview,3.5,"The accessible entrance to this venue can be found round the back, and is a single, manual door that isn't particularly heavy. Immediately to the left is a platform lift to go down into the venue. The platform lift does require rotating 90 degrees between getting on an off, but is large enough to accommodate this, even for a powered wheelchair. The tables and chairs are spaced far enough apart to move between them, and the majority are at a comfortable height to reach from the wheelchair. Most of the chairs are easily moved to açcommodate wheelchairs too. Some of the bars and street food vendors have high counters, and with the music it can be difficult to communicate with staff. However, the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming, and seem well trained at handling disability. I wasn't there for too long so didn't use the bathroom, but I believe the disabled toilet lacks full changing facilities. There are several bus stops and taxi ranks close to the venue, and the train station is about half a mile away, making it easy to get to on public transport. However, nearby car parking is extremely limited.

6587,8280,Overview,2.0,"As Edinburgh grew into a vibrant city, in 1890 the Caledonian railway company extended its line, and built an exclusive high end station at Princess Street. , and it’s main attraction would be the wonderful boutique hotel, and after almost 4 years of building, the Caledonian Hotel proudly opened its doors in 1903. As railway travel declined, the Princess Street station was closed in 1965, and demolished almost completely around 1970. However, the hotel itself was saved,  and later expanded to increase the size of the hotel. In 1995 it was made a Listed building, class A, and in 2000 it was sold for around 44 million pounds to the Hilton group. It was later renamed as the Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh the Caledonian. When it was sold again, in 2018, it cost 85 million pound, and this made it one of the most luxurious hotels and an Icon of Princess street. Today, this former railway station offers some of the finest views of Edinburgh castle, and across the road from Princess Street gardens. It was here we hoped to offer you our review. Due to COVID 19 restrictions we are unable to give a full review, but we were allowed access to some areas though. We caught a bus from Waverley station on Princess street, to get off three stops later, (photo 1), to go to the Waldorf Astoria hotel, the Caledonian, (photo 2).  The appearance was very pleasing to the eye, and there was a ramp to enter the hotel (photo 3).   A beautiful reception desk (photo 4) stood next to two highly polished lifts, (photo 5). The lounge bar of Peacock Alley was beautifully decorated (photo 6) certainly had that wow factor, then a lovely staircase led up to bedrooms (photo 7). What a hotel, elegant, beautiful, and certainly worth seeing, an ideal hotel for disabled, although bus stops mean a little walking has to be done, but everywhere in  hotel seemed to be wheelchair friendly enough. Then a long walk took us to Queensferry road for our bus to take us back to Princess street. (Photo 8). Our final thoughts. We were disappointed not to see more of the hotel, but the parts we were able to see was spotless, shiney, elegant, and you certainly felt in there that you needed to dress up. But my wheelchair and I were warmly welcomed, and we already felt we would recommend this hotel, though it would be pricey (example, from £370 a night and upwards, during September 2021). But my, would you enjoy your visit.",waldorf astoria edinburgh   the caledonian edinburgh,negative,0,1

With one crutch I really struggled to use the toilet as it was one of those narrow one toilet rooms.

6644,29416,Overview,4.0,"This 17th century Coaching Inn, Greswolde Arms, was originally named “the Mermaid Inn”. It was later bought by the Greswolde family in the early 1700’s, and remained with the family for the next 200 years. The oldest part was a timber framed structure, with steep gables. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was extended and renovated to expand its coaching trade, as this was a major stop on the Birmingham to London route.  It is positioned nicely in the lovely old picturesque High street of Knowle, Solihull, (see our REVIEW for Knowle, Solihull) having played a main role in Knowle village over the years. Lady Byron, wife of poet Lord Byron, enjoyed a visit here, and the Beatles stayed here in 1963.  The 3 star hotel has a carpark (free for guests) with 33 modern decorated bedrooms, With one being a disabled room. It has a beer garden, and is a dog friendly hotel.  READ OUR REVIEW  The walk across from carpark is level enough and only a short walk, (4) and looks inviting, with many attractively filled tubs of mainly evergreen shrubs (5) with plenty of outdoor furniture to allow sunny warm day visits (6). There is a ramp available to the left of main entrance (7) and then it’s all on the level for you. A plain simple reception desk invites you to book in if you have an overnight stay (8)  With the bedrooms quite close to reception (9) and these are of a reasonable size, very clean and attractive enough looking (10). The bar awaits you (11) small but in an interesting corner of hotel (12) which heads you into the large open spaced restaurant (photo 13) with simple wooden table and chairs (14) and quieter spots can be found with space to put wheelchairs (15). In a corner spot is the entry for toilets (16) which has a disabled toilet (17)  which is basic,  clean, well maintained, with grab rails, and you could spin chair around in there. Then it’s back outside again following your coffee break, or something more appealing perhaps, and we suggest you take a short stroll along High street, before returning to car park.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS An attractive looking place that invites you to go in. Spacious inside with room for wheelchair to move around. No lounge however to simple sit and relax, you have to sit at tables. Friendly, but nothing outstanding, but still worth dropping in for a visit over a drink or two, or for a meal.",greswolde arms hotel solihull,positive,1,1

6697,13505,Access,3.5,"There is flat access via two different entrances, with a variety of terrain types.  Explained with reference to photos:  Photos 2-7 show me entering the north east side of the site via Pepys Court, which is at the back of the housing estate. There is an option of steps or a flat access road, the road is concrete but very textured so it rattles you about a bit. But my scooter performed admirably. I assume the texture is to give traction to cars in flooded or muddy conditions.  You then go along a packed dirt path, over a wooden bridge, and through a narrow gap round the edge of a gate. This gap was fine for me in my boot scooter and I should think most wheelchair users and small scooter users will find it manageable. If you have a very big scooter you may struggle.   Once you are in the site, there are tarmac paths around blocks of long grass meadow and quite easy to get around on wheels. There are benches to sit on in the north east side of the site including picnic benches, but no benches with back support.  Photos 8 and 9 show me crossing from the north east side of the site to the south west side. This side of the site is a grassy playing field and in early March it was quite muddy! I had to get off my scooter and walk it in some places as the scooter was just spinning its wheels in the mud. In summer I expect it's much drier.  Photos 10-14 are taken from the wetland habitat in the south west side of the site. To get to it you either have to cross about 30m of grass if coming from the north east side, or about 80m of grass if coming from the Riverside Bridge entrance. There is a long shot showing the Riverside Bridge and its wooden ramp from the wetland habitat. The wetland habitat itself has a mixture of boardwalk and dirt paths. On my scooter I found it very manageable.  Photos 15 and 16 show the wooden ramp used to access the south west side of the site from Riverside Bridge. I'm not good at judging slope but it's less steep than some I've used, pretty confident it's less than 1:12. Scooter had no problems with it. There are also steps with a hand rail.  The last two photos show views from up on Riverside Bridge. The bridge itself has no steps. The slope is longer and shallower than other local bridges like Cutter Ferry and Fort St George but I imagine it would still be quite demanding to do in a manual wheelchair.",logans meadow cambridge,positive,1,0

In the grounds, there is a mixture of surfaces, including concrete, gravel, cobbles and grass. I took my Freewheel, knowing that this would help with the uneven surfaces.  The estate is vast! The road and pavement go round in a circle, taking in all of the areas, which are pretty well signposted. The paths down to some areas are quite steep, so some wheelchair users may need assistance both up and down. The day we went was quite hot and I was concerned about my assistance dog with the heat but there are plenty of shaded areas as you go between areas.  The furthest place from the entrance is the village/town. It took us a good 20 to 30 minutes to get there. Many of the shops and all the houses have steps in and so I couldn't access everything. The cafe was accessible though, up a good ramp from the top of the park and it was well laid out with plenty of space.   There were a lot of things I could access but also quite a lot I couldn't but I had expected this and was quite happy just to do what I could.   The road back to the entrance would have been a long trek uphill and it was a really hot day, so we were glad of the accessible bus. We used it twice. The first time, we asked a member of staff and they radioed for it, but the second time, we just waited for it to come round on its regular circuit. The lift on the back was great.

6879,33435,Overview,3.5,"Access here is mixed but it has a couple of access features that most other local beaches don't, and it's a lovely beach for a day out.  First, while the car park is 200m from the beach, there is a road that runs right down to the sand. So if you have limited mobility but you're in a party with a driver who can do the walk, you can have them drop you off 10m from the beach. From there it is a slightly sloped tarmac road and then directly onto the beach sand, no steps. And no miles long slip road or switchback cliffside path! Joy!  Note that the 200m walk to the car park is on quite a steep hill.  Second, there is a beach wheelchair. I have seen it on display to be borrowed and have seen it in use but haven't used myself.  The biggest drawback is toilets. No public toilets! People tend to ask in one of the two restaurants but I have not checked for flat access and I know at least some of the entrances have steps. When I went last time I was lucky enough to swim and so let's be honest, I just peed in the sea.  As mentioned, flat access to restaurants is dubious, I would not rely on it without phoning ahead. (I'll check it myself next time and add detail.) In the summer there is a kiosk that sells ice cream and chips and things that you can eat on the beach. This is up a short slope but I think no steps. And if any member of your party can get there, they can bring stuff for all of you. Otherwise bring a picnic.  If the access situation works for you, it's a great beach for a day out. Sandy, sheltered, small to medium sized. There is rental of double kayaks and paddle boards, though I haven't used them since I got sick so don't know how they handle disabled users. Also deck chair rental. The shelter of the harbour means the sea is normally less rough than at most beaches in the area, and it's a sandy beach with a gentle slope. Great if you want sea swimming in a gentle setting or if you've brought kids.",polkerris beach par,positive,1,1

We need the overhead hoist. we had the hospital bed and a single bed in the room. the opal room is very nice but not much in the way of storage space at all. restricted space also with second bed. the overhead hoist strip is quite short and runs from over the hospital bed to bathroom where it stops. There is a separate, unconnected, strip in the bathroom so you will need to lift into chair from bed, wheel into bathroom, then unhook and lift again into bath, and same on way out. A bit of a faff when wet. Also as the hoist trip is quite short when not in use it sits just outside bathroom door so tends to get in the way.  good shower. easy to clean up. did not use jacuzzi bath. tried the electric shower chair which was good.",the rings cupar,positive,1,0

6942,56155,Overview,4.0,"The accessibility is overall good. There is enough room for a powerchair pr scooter to get through the door and move around inside to a table. The accessible bathroom is big but the staff have made it inaccessible by putting an IKEA changing table in the doorway. It is freestanding so you could ask them to move it if needed.  The food is very nice. It is also affordable and there are lots of menu options to make your visit in cheaper such as all you can eat. If you are doing an all you can eat deal have a look at both menus as they both have different foods on. The slightly more expensive one has more choice and has bigger portions. If you do all you can eat or any of the X number of dishes for a set price then all of your party have to choose the same deal. This is so the people you are with dont choose one dish each for £3 and then take advantage of one person paying for all you can eat.  The decor is very tired with blocks of old tiles propping open doorways and a broken fan stuck on a shelf. It can be a bit depressing if the restaurant is empty and therefore not lively.  It is very clean and you can see right into the kitchen which I like. I've never had a bad experience regards to cleanliness or food handling.  I did once order olives which are always pitted but recently they have stones twice in a row so I would be careful for bones and stones if you are at risk of choking.  I live locally and pretty much every time I have been there is at least one wheelchair user as it's the only local place that is fully accessible as far as I know. It's also great for lots of food on a budget.  Unfortunately the only vegan options are Greek salad, hold the feta, or hummus and bread. I recently developed lactose intolerance and won't be able to visit so bear this in mind. There are quite a few options for vegetarians who eat cheese though.",la salsa horwich,positive,1,1

7009,31109,Access,1.0,"There's level access into the shop, and once you're inside you will - if you're a wheelchair user - find it uncomfortably cramped and tight, very very hard to get around the aisles with ease. Some of the shelving units are unstable, on one visit I knocked one with my powerchair and it fell ON me, as well as tipping its contents all over the floor. I was lucky not to be injured. This is all very annoying and unhelpful.  There is a platform lift to all floors. This lift is operated by holding down a button at around nipple-height if you're seated, and it takes some strength and effort to keep the button pressed. If you have any hand or arm weakness, you will find it very hard indeed to operate the lift. In addition to this difficulty, the lift sometimes gets stuck and then the door will not open.   On my most recent visit, the lift broke down between the basement and the ground floor, with me inside it. I was stuck inside it for a long time. The staff tried valiantly to hand-crank the lift back to the ground floor, but without success, so they hand-cranked it to the basement, where I was then stuck for another long time until the fire-brigade were called to carry my heavy powerchair up the stairs, an astonishing feat of skill and strength.  When it comes to paying, if you're paying by card, and you're a wheelchair user, you probably won't be able to use the credit-card readers, because they are fixed to a tall frame in front of the till, well out of reach, and (unlike most such devices) cannot be removed from their cradle.

It will be well worth the short walk back to reception for your carer. The grounds are very well cared for, evergreen shrubs provide wonderful photos, ideal for special occasion memories.  This time, if approaching front of NutHurst Grange, take the right hand drive (photo 1) which leads to a large car park (photo 2), but again we suggest your driver takes you first of all to the reception and leave you inside the hotel, while they return to the main car park.

The path led to the terrace garden (photo 5) and four steps led to reception (photo 6). Later on, after settling in, from reception there is a very scenic walk (photo 7) which led past beautiful gardens (photo 8) and ahead was a large manicured lawn with a variety of trees and shrubs (photo 9). A few yards away is the delightful looking functions building (photo 10) where your special occasion, such as weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, are catered for (photo 11). In the far right hand corner there is a ramp available (photo 12) that takes you down to the formal garden (photo 13) with trimmed hedges that highlight the statues (photo 14).

7328,27404,Access,5.0,"The main entrance to the museum is on Beaumont Street. There is a short flight of stairs with a handrail or a ramp for step free access. At the entrance there is a revolving door and on either side are push button doors.   The museum is step free. There are lifts to all floors, but not every lift serves all floors, which is slightly confusing. It's not ideal but staff were very helpful in pointing me in the right direction so it wasn't a problem. The lifts are not particularly large, it was crowded when there were 4 people standing in it. The lifts are busy so I usually had to wait a while for the lift to arrive. There are also stairs but I didn't use them.  I went specifically to see the Pompeii special exhibition, which was on the third floor. The exhibition has been extremely popular and is often sold out, so when I visited it was very busy. I had requested a fold up stool and this was extremely helpful as there was a lot to see and I wanted to take the time to read the information panels. The exhibition was well laid out with mainly vertical glass cases. There were some benches without back support or arms throughout the exhibition.   When I arrived at the museum I went to their self service café in the lower ground floor for a sandwich. The food was displayed on counter and shelves, both suitable for people at standing height. The café had a lot of free standing tables and chairs. The café area has a number of pillars. It was very busy when I visited.  After the exhibition I went to the roof top restaurant on the 4th floor for afternoon tea. The restaurant is waiter service. There are free standing tables and chairs. There is also a step free outdoor terrace, which I didn't use.  ",ashmolean museum oxford,positive,1,0
7329,23146,Overview,5.0,"We often have problems finding suitable holiday accommodation as we require an electric profile bed with cot sides, hoist, wet room with wheel-in-shower chair and a designated parking spot for our Wheelchair Access Vehicle (i.e. Van). Normally this is like “Gold Dust” to find, but Our Bench have it all covered.  We had a wonderful week in Bench Cottage. The Accommodation was very clean and modern and had all the extras and essentials (e.g. grill, cork-screw, can-opener, microwave cooker, hair-dryer, washing machine, tumble dryer, rotary washing line, etc.) that often get forgotten about by some self-catering establishments. It was really home from home, the bungalow was fantastic, all that was required was catered for, and there was ample turning space for the wheelchair user.  Bench Cottage is a well-designed cosy bungalow which is excellent accommodation for the severely disabled wheelchair user. It is situated in a peaceful quiet location in the New Forest, just a short walk away from the village pub, village chippy and convenience stores. Initially our first impressions was that the accommodation was too far away from Lymington to walk, but it only took 20 minutes to reach the town by electric wheelchair, and we did this on numerous occasions. The place is ideally situated for visiting New Forest attractions and places further afield like Bournemouth and Portsmouth. There are lots to do in such a wonderful area and our week was not enough time to do all we wanted, so would wholeheartedly recommend Our Bench and look forward to booking again in the near future.

7332,28974,Overview,1.5,"This review is for the main Corn Exchange venue, not others located in the same area.  The attitude taken by this venue to accessibility is disappointing.  When I visited for a busy event, they had coned off 2 of the 6 disabled parking spaces.  There are two sections to the building and to move between them you need to be escorted by a member of staff  out onto the road and then left to wait until someone comes to open a fire exit at the top section.  The ramp to this section is so steep as to be unsafe and leads onto a cobbled lane.  Although the footpath is not cobbled, it is blocked at one end by a large sign advising visitors to the adjacent Chinese restaurant that they cannot park.  This means that to get from this section of the building to the disable parking, you need to go back to the front of the building and then through the atrium area.  I am glad it was not raining.   I never found the disabled toilet and event staff didn't know if there was one.   Both food service areas have very high counters with no accessible section.  I had to resort to shouting and waving my arms to get service.    I've raised issues at the venue before but have been told the owner is not interested in addressing any of them.

7341,11825,Overview,4.0,My dad very recently has multiple disabilities and uses a wheelchair unfortunately he was another well enough to come on this trip as planned so it is written from a carer point of view. On arrival I asked the staff many questions regarding assessibility and they were all very friendly and helpful. I noted there were 5 disabled parking spaces. There is a bus that can be requested to take you into the castle as the entrance is in a very steep hill. It is important to note if you are reliant on this then maybe call in advance of your visit as I was told the bus was not guaranteed and was dependent on the availability that day of someone to drive it. Most areas if the castle are assessibility and even more if you have some mobility and can walk over certain parts. For example in the great Hall there were 2 steps down into it and then a ramp once inside the hall. The regimental museum is not assessible as it has steep windy stairs and lift alternative.  The wall walk is narrow and at parts there are no barriers and a steep drop. I would guess this would be challenging to the visually impaired. In summary I think this would be a good place to visit. There is only so much that can be changed with an historic building and I think stirling castle has done as much as they can to make their venue open to all.

7464,15756,Overview,5.0,"I recently visited Sara’s Cottage in Truro, Cornwall, and I was so impressed with all of their disabled-friendly facilities on site. As a full-time wheelchair user myself, I could not fault their access.  Just outside the cottage is a large courtyard area perfect for parking your vehicle on solid ground. There is level access throughout the cottage, and even where there was a small threshold - for example into the conservatory or back garden patio - this was not an issue for my wheelchair.   The lounge / kitchen area was very spacious and there was a lovely welcome pack left on the side with a selection of Cornish goodies! The accessible bedroom had plenty of space to manoeuvre, as well as various equipment available should it be needed - for example bed blocks to raise the large double bed should a hoist be needed underneath.  The en-suite bathroom was possibly my favourite room of the cottage! The design was so stylish and all of the adaptions were carefully thought out. The wet-room shower had completely level access, with various hand rails dotted around for support. A shower chair / commode was also available. Extra little touches that I appreciated were the adjustable mirror and lowered sink - perfect for getting your knees underneath if you’re a wheelchair user.  The doorways were nice and wide so this was not an issue for me. I believe the cottage is also dog friendly which is always good to know!   Overall I was so impressed with all of the facilities at Sara’s cottage. The owners have clearly made a special effort to accommodate the needs of people with various disabilities - from mobility aids, to special equipment for people with visual / hearing impairments. This includes a hearing loop system, a vibrating alarm pillow and documents printed with a readable size font on yellow paper.  Situated not too far from the city centre, Sara’s cottage is the perfect rural retreat!",saras cottage truro,positive,1,1

Disabled toilets easy to get to.  3 issues NOT the venues fault that hampered my visit. Heavy awkward doors into cinema (thankfully I was on crutches and not in my wheelchair), I know they are like that to hinder light and noise but they really make it hard for the lesser abled. Thankfully my wife was around to open them for me most of the time but when I had to go (well the new Bond flik is almost 3 hours long) an unknown stranger did the honours with the door, thanks again. A “press here to open” button would be a welcome addition. This takes me onto my second issue. Walking (if you can call it that) on crutches to a disabled loo and hearing the phrase “use the disabled it’s closer” is galling. It’s closer for a reason you inconsiderate idiot. The staff member who was close shook her head and loudly offered to take me to the nearest accessible loo, big thumbs up to her and Cineworld, huge thumbs down to the idiot . 3rd issue was the hand sanitiser stations all around, pedal operated when you are on crutches or wheels becomes a problem but the foam that came out was easy to rub in, not slippy and dried quick.   These issues were not the fault of the venue. ",cineworld falkirk,positive,1,1

A truly delightful courtyard welcomes you to sit in among the flower beds, and there is a ramp (photo 4 ) is help you move around. The first little shop we visited was a gift shop, (photo 5) full of interesting knickknacks  that we could browse through, (photo 6)  and this is all on the level. (photo 7). We then went through another archway (photo 8) with quite a few little stalls to see,   all on level polished brickwork paving for easy access (photo 9). There was a sweet shop with large glass jars, (photo 10) then we entered a little shop selling cards, framed  pictures and other gifts (photo 11). Back in the beautiful courtyard, (photo 12) a picture postcard Tea room (photo 13) draws you towards it. Beside the lovely flower display the entrance awaits (photo 14). There is a small low step to get you into the Tea room, which is manageable, although we chose to leave our wheelchair outside. The entrance is all on the level and is very appealing (photo 15). There are a number of rooms for you to choice where to sit to enjoy your refreshment and the restaurant is very nicely laid with dark relaxing cane furniture (photo 16), and there is a terraced area outside, also tastefully inviting. We sat inside to enjoy our toasted tea cake and coffee, along with quite a few others also enjoying their selection.

It takes you through the history of whisky, how it is made and how each area makes whisky different in character and flavour.  It's an accessible journey, right from the moment you enter the Scotch Whisky Experience. We were greeted by two friendly members of reception who confirmed our silver tour and we waited for the tour to commence. I would say the 'waiting area' could be bigger but we were only there for five minutes.   It was the attentive nature of staff that made the visit for me. I attended with a powerchair user and the 'experience' starts with an immersive trip on a barrel that guides you through the history of whisky and what happens during the distilling process. Doesn't sound accessible, but the way the venue have adapted is inclusive. The staff member spoke us through every step of how it would work which makes you feel so welcome. You just knew exactly what to expect and that made it such an enjoyable visit.  Even as somebody who has never been here before - embarrassing as a lifetime Edinburgh resident! - I was extremely impressed by the concise yet effective tour. The whole tour was short but it didn't feel rushed. While the tasting is great - and the journey at this point is even better - the colours to coordinate which whisky you want to taste could be a bit clearer.

This must of been how they got up to the castle years ago, it is amazing a car fits through the gatehouse.  Once at the top parking could not of been close and even without need of a wheelchair I didn't envy the walk up from the main carpark.  It was an easy wheel to the main door, here was a sloping step/ramp which was tricky to negotiate (needed moe muscle). The first part of the castle was no problem and visitors were asked to move around in a clockwise way, to see everything. I was unable to venture further and shown a DVD of what I was missing. It appears that I miss a lot. Incidentally on looking out of Windows brings home how high it actually is and how close the sea is.  Once the Castle was done we headed for the little coffee shop, well shed really.  It was the old stables.  Apparently this wasn't the main cafe as that was up some steps.

We then had to cross the road and follow this bumpy path until we got to the ground, and I was expecting to be told if I could go around the side of the ground to access (Deveronvale if you're reading this PLEASE let wheelchairs/scooters around the side of the ground) because I had to go through a ""Wheelchair entrance"" which wasn't good. I had to drive through a very tight angle (call me Michael Schumacher) then there was an about 4-inch drop so I needed a strewed to lift me down. When we finally entered the ground and a member of staff greeted us and welcomed us to Princess Royal Park and told us that we could go in a disabled shelter, it had a ramp up to the door of the shelter but there were already 4 people in the shelter so I, unfortunately, couldn't get into the disabled shelter so I can't really comment. We then went around the back of the 'stand' and found a quiet spot with a good view to watch the football match, another thing I would like to comment on is the fact that Princess Royal Park has smooth cement paths all the way around the stadium, perfect for wheelchairs! At halftime, I asked the Steward to show me when the toilet is so I was surprised to find out there was a disabled toilet.

7984,1915,Overview,2.0,"This first part of the day trip is a pleasant easy start with scenic countryside views leading to the historical pretty village of Chaddesley Corbett, so even if you feel you could not manage the woodland walk, or make use of the Swan Inn, it’s still a nice start for you, bearing in mind the next point of interest on your trip will not open until 10.00am.  We started our visit in the village of Belbroughton, Bromsgrove, so set your SAT NAV  DY9  9TG for the Talbot Inn.  From here and at the junction, follow High street and sign for Blakedown / Chaddesley Corbett. There is no sat NAV for the ancient woodland of Chaddesley woods nature reserve, so follow our directions for the short drive. A few yards after leaving the Talbot and High st, TURN LEFT on Church road. Then stay on this lane for a few miles, until you reach a “Y” junction and TURN RIGHT for Woodcote / Kidderminster and then drive through woodland, it’s a nice countryside trip for you. At the next junction, TURN SHARP RIGHT for Bluntington / Woodrow, along Woodcote Lane, and drive through woodland again. Look for the roadside pull in area,  parking the car alongside the narrow woodland lane (photo 1)  The gate will allow you to enter the wide path (photo 2) for a pleasant woodland walk.  Chaddesley woods is mentioned in the Doomsday book, shown as “the woods of two leagues” perhaps wooded since the ice age, ancient flowers offer the clue, such as yellow Archangel, herb Paris, Dogs Mercury, as well as small leaved Lime. It became a nature reserve in 1973 due to the kind support of John Cadbury. (photo 3). On the east side there are ancient woodland of mainly Oak, with Hazel Coppice. It also supports Rowan trees, Midland Hawthorn which has two seeds in its berry  instead of one.  To the west, it is different, with large planted broad leaved species, and large areas of conifers. Where you have parked is the “Jubillee walk” created in 1977 to mark the Queens 25th jubilee anniversary, and you can easily follow this path on Yellow markers, and it attracts many visitors each year.  Now set SAT NAV for DY10 4SA. The Swan inn. Follow Sat NAV, and you will arrive at the gated entry for Chaddesley Corbett (photo 4) CHADDESLEY CORBETT The village is an ancient settlement, with a pre-historical mound, and there are parts of a Roman road, while it’s name is thought to mean “Ceadda’s clearing in the woods”. It is first mentioned in the Saxon charter when the land was given to the Bishop of Worcester, and also mentioned in the Doomsday book 1086, as belonging to a Saxon noblewoman. The village was known later on as Chaddesley, but following the Norman conquest, the old Manor was owned by the Corbett family, and the area became known as Chaddesley Corbett. It is a large parish of some 6079 acres, where the Dovedale brook rises in Belbroughton, and flows south of the parish. Barnet brook, which also rises in Belbroughton, waters the northern area.  Chaddesley Corbett has one main road running through the village, (photo 5) where you will find black and white timbered cottages, and red bricked houses, (photo 6) of different years. A number of delightful cottages may be seen along the main road (photos 7, 8 and 9) leading you towards two attractive Inns, The Swan Inn, and the Talbot Inn, of which we now offer you a review. THE SWAN INN The Doomsday book recorded the village of Chaddesley Corbett, and following dates show that during the reign of King Edward V1 in 1552, a licence would now be required from 1634 to run any Inn as stated “there are nun that sell ale without a licence.  The Swan became rented by the miller master, John Bate, then his son Thomas took over in 1841. It was a home brew house, the drink being mild, pale, sweetish and strong, popular in this area, but they were also licensed to sell wines and spirits. Thomas had died by 1850, and his wife Elizabeth took over as landlady, but she retired in 1873, and a William Horne became the tenant with the help of his wife Mary. In 1927 the Swan was leased to Daniel Batham and son, and remains so, with the intention of keeping it as a centre of local community use.  The Swan inn, (photo 10) has a reasonable car park, but very plain looking, (photo 11) until you step inside, to the bar area. (12) while the main lounge of timbered beams, old wooden tables and a warm welcoming stove awaits you (13).The larger bar area (14) also  has a warm stove to greet you (15), and toilets are situated by the bar reception (16).   If you now drive along the main road a few yards, you arrive at The Talbot Inn, (17) which has been closed for some time while undergoing renovations over the last number of years, and permission has been granted for it to reopen again as an Inn, perhaps late 2022, although not much seems to be happening at the moment.  If you drive a little further on, to the churchyard, (photo 18)  we can give A bit of World War One history for you. The home guard division of Chaddesley received orders to form a line of defence against enemy attack by tanks, so the men here used two large 4 foot diameter drainage pipes, filled them with concrete, placed an iron bar with a loop in it into the setting concrete, then attached a large steel chain between the two pipes that lay each side of the road, and you can still see these pipes that lie in the church orchard  ( photo 19) right by the gate leading into the churchyard (photo 20). www.Chaddesley-Corbett.co.uk/history  Thus ends part one of this day trip, and we suggest now you read part two HARVINGTON HALL AND MUSEUM.

8085,55603,Access,2.5,"We had been allocated an adapted Virginia lodge, number 1. Sadly, this disabled lodge is the very furthest possible from the facilities,right by the entrance. Every time you want to go to the bar, pool, restaurant, it’s over 800m. It also meant we had no view (other lodges get a spectacular landscape). The parking is on a heavy incline where most others are flat, so it’s very difficult to get out of the car into a wheelchair, we kept having to drive to flat ground to use the car, which undermines checking that parking is next to the lodge.    It’s also noisy, with vehicles coming and going constantly, and they often came through so fast that I was terribly worried about my daughter playing near the lodge. Being the first ones on the road, we got the fastest traffic.   We also checked about the decking area and type of furniture, to make sure we could use it. The furniture is indeed loose (not picnic table, though there is one of those also) but if you need a turning space for a weelchair then you cannot use the proper decking area, as the only bit which fits the table is by the door. We could have the furniture OR go in and out, so ended up with our chairs all in a line along the walkway with the table in the middle. We couldn’t eat on the decking like everyone else, though this might be possible if the wheelchair user isn’t involved in the food prep and can be trapped at the far side of the table through the whole meal.   I did speak to reception at one point to say the hedge was over growing the ramp area, and could they try to get it clipped back for comfort, and they acted immediately. Within the hour, the whole hedge had been clipped and tidied, so that was excellent.   We knew it was not an accessible kitchen, which was fine for us as we usually use only the oven, and my husband does all the dishes.    And here is where the biggest problem comes in - accessibility is built into the *TWIN* bedroom, they have even taken space from the double to give more wheelchair space in the twin. The doorway to the twin is widened and the bathroom pretty good, with high loo (for me, 5’5” this was a disconcertingly high loo!), toilet rails (fold up) on both sides.Only a bath with over bath shower, which is what we asked for as I take showers at the swimming pool, and a bath chair fits the bath which is ensuite to the twin. If, however, you are the disabled half of a couple with kids, there is nowhere to move around even on foot in the double, never mind with a wheelchair. The wheelchair will not go within 8m of the bedroom as it doesn’t fit through the access corridor to the double and the double (not adapted) bathroom. You end up waking the kids every time you go to the loo in their accessible bathroom. I  don’t want to have a separate room from my husband on holiday and my daughter sure doesn’t want to be in a double with her dad, so we have to try to take turns moving about. The actual floor of the loge slopes considerably, and if you are on wheels or wobbly on your feet, you will spend a lot of time falling down, being unable to adjust to the slope.   Access exists in the main building, you just often find yourself having to take different routes, and I did laugh when they said it was totally accessible, you go round the back via the gravel path - GRAVEL for wheelchair access!   The pool does have a hoist poolside and there is a track hoist in the changing area, but no bench. They also seem to have built a wall part way up the track, I can’t really fathom it, but I managed without so it was OK. The disabled change was in use by other people around 80% of the times we wanted it though, which was annoying. Avoid the times when there are swimming lessons, as you get a family in there using the larger space to change several children, in no hurry because the lesson hasn’t started yet. Meanwhile I’m cold and dripping wet. Oh, and if you do get in it’s one of those with a lock at each end, so close both and make sure to unlock both when you leave. Although there’s hoist access into the pool, it’s fixed not to give access to the jacuzzi. I managed to get in the jacuzzi by transfer, but the start button is on the wall 5m away and you have to press it every 5 minutes to put it back on.  The play area is pretty definitively inaccessible, I have an Alber Adventure full suspension off road chair, and it couldn't do this at all.

The Whiskey Experience has a flat entrance  from the pavement and an automatic door. The entrance/ticket desk is low, so can be reached from a wheelchair.  We were going on a tour, which starts with a 'Barrel ride,' we were impressed they had a wheelchair accessible 'barrel.' For this, there is ramped access into the front of the barrel. There is room for one person in a wheelchair and one carer/friend to sit in it. From the outside, it looks exactly the same as the other barrels. It follows a track to take you on a short ride explaining the history and processes of whiskey.  It is a smooth ride, moving fairly slowly, it's not scary. There are some flashing/bright lights, but say to a member of staff if this is a concern (it's also possible just not to go on the ride if you choose).  There is only one accessible barrel, perhaps having another would be good especially if you were visiting in a group with more than one person in a wheelchair.   In each of the rooms you go into on the tour, there is room for at least two wheelchairs, and at all times you are made to feel part of the group no matter your needs.  There is lift access to the different floors.  Information is presented in different ways, using technology, film clips, staff talking, sound and lights. We particularly liked the scratch-and-sniff cards which explained about the different regions of Scotland different Whiskeys come from.

(2) They are always too short, with the result that when deployed on most kerbs they are far too steep to be either safe or comfortable.   (3) There is too little headroom to enter the taxi comfortably while seated in your wheelchair.   (4) It can take a long time to deploy the ramp - they get stuck, and drivers often mislay the key needed to unlock the ramp for deployment.   (5) Once you're inside the cab, there isn't room to turn around, so inevitably you emerge from the cab backwards down a very steep slope, which can be terrifying and is certainly not safe, even when a well-meaning cab driver is guiding you with his hands on the wheelchair handles. On one occasion a driver yanked me roughly down the ramp, with the result that my wheelchair (with me in it) fell off the ramp sideways. Luckily I wasn't injured and my wheelchair wasn't damaged, but it could have turned out very differently.  NB there is one model of London black cab which offers a big improvement on the above problems, it's the 'Vista Comfort Plus' model. It has a long ramp, which is not steep, it has enough headroom and is more spacious inside. It is a MUCH more wheelchair-friendly experience. The longer ramp gives a much less steep ride into the cab and feels much safer. Unfortunately there are not many of this model of cab on the roads. ",london black cabs london,negative,0,0

The exhibition itself is about 80 minutes long and is a lot of standing (if you don’t have a wheelchair) which might be something to be aware of.

8960,50601,Overview,2.5,"After reviewing this excellent hotel in part one, we were delighted to find that they have tried hard to offer far more to their visitors in the way of entertainment during your visit here, and the present owner, Mr Rick Cressman has done well with his ambition for this lovely property. It is a 15 acre site, with the very attractive old Jacobean house as it focal point,  and has a very well laid out 9 hole par 3 golf course, while indoors you will find a very pleasant heated swimming pool, a small but well equipped gym, a facility area ideal for small wedding occasions with a lovely setting, while larger gatherings will be delighted with the large marque that will hold wedding parties and regular evening entertainment with various shows that you would enjoy.  OUR REVIEW Parking is easy enough, but only one disabled bay, but it’s not far to walk anyway.  The grounds outside have been landscaped in a natural way, with many tall old trees and shrubs to see, (photo 1) and passing Nailcote Halls Jacobean 17th century hall, an inviting path leads ahead (photo 2) towards the purpose built leisure centre (3). Entering, which is on the level, you enter a cheerful well decorated ground floor greeting area, (4) very clean and inviting, and the metal ironworks and staircase hold  promise of what’s to come (photo 5), and this room can be used for wedding day delights, or for small entertainments (6).  The disabled do not have to worry, as a small lift is available for you, just beyond the staircase (7) which is big enough to get you and your chair inside, along with your Carer (8). The room today has been set up for a wedding reception, in what is called Ricks  Bar, but Over in the right hand corner (photo 9) the door will lead to a very nice Roman bath style heated swimming pool, (10) with a bubbling jacuzzi that looks so inviting (11) and a steam room is available for your use. You will also find a small but well equipped modern gym that awaits your attention (12). The entertainment facilities here are very popular and booking is important, but it is a very nice building, well lit and has natural lighting provided by its glass roofed ceiling (13). The main path will now lead you pass the grounds (14) and the up to date converted and restored brick work of the upper bedrooms (15) towards the nine hole par 3 golf course (16) and beyond this you will reach a delightful summer outdoor seating area (17). At one time, part of the grounds held a croquet lawn, and Pétanque area, which is an interesting game that disabled could enjoy as well. HOW YOU WOULD HAVE PLAYED. It’s a type of boules game, but with this game you toss the ball into the air rather than roll it, to try to get as near as possible to a jack, BUT the ball must not touch the jack, or you loss that round. So this is ideal for disabled, as no steps are taken, you can remain in your chair while you toss your ball, and these are smaller than normal boules so are easier to grasp. Sadly it is no longer used here for these two games anymore.  The grounds with its own small pool (18) has an entrance (but mind you, with steps to get you up into the marque ). The disabled will of course have to enjoy arriving into this huge marque, from inside the hotel and the specially built entrance (19) but what a treat greets you (20) and it’s here that the large entertainment shows are held, as well as wedding day treats. Most of the regularly held shows will include a three course meal and a late night show, usually finishing by 1.00 am. Details can be found on the hotels website.  So you will gather it’s a popular hotel nowadays, and to see it at its best do please read our part one review, for we are sure you will enjoy your visit just as much as we did.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS. We really do recommend this hotel to our disabled friends, and our review of the hotel itself will show you why, but this review of what you can do and expect on a visit here should encourage you to come and see for yourselves, they really do try to please, the shows that are provided are very good, the food is well recommended, it’s quite easy enough to get around both indoors and out there when the sun is out to play, and most of all, you will be well looked after by the staff members, and they will make sure you enjoy your visit, do come and play .

Their menu isn't huge but if definitely offers something for everyone, soups, sandwiches/toasties, baked potatoes, quiches, homemade burgers and a couple of specials. Dad opted for the curry special and I decided upon a brie and onion chutney toastie, plus tea for two.  Didn't take long to arrive and was awesome, dad's curry looked enough for two and my toastie was oozing with filling. No little tea cups here, oh no a proper mug each and enough tea to fill them twice over.  The staff were lovely, the older lady in front of me was deaf and so struggling to understand what they were saying, her daughter was helping but it still took 3 attempts.  The young girl serving didn't rush her or look annoyed at all.  Tables are a little close together but there's a couple nearer the serving area that would be perfect for a wheelchair user.  Toilet was fab, spacious and clean, great layout.  The view out to the ocean and all the sea birds make it perfect. Good to see lots of local using it - shows it must be good.

9208,37312,Overview,5.0,"I agree with another reviewer that the doors are very heavy, luckily for me, the doors are open all the time to improve ventilation as a result of the pandemic which is great for easy access. I have found the staff to be lovely and will go out of their way to accommodate me as a wheelchair user. The reception area is positioned in such a way that they would be able to spot someone struggling with the door. Before the pandemic when the doors were closed, I would wave from the door to get help. Perhaps a doorbell would be a helpful improvement?  When I go for an eye test I normally phone and let them know that I'm in a wheelchair so that they know I'll need extra room. But I recently used the online booking system for the first time but have been told that wheelchair users should only book through the phone – which is disappointing. I had to rearrange my appointment due to accessibility issues despite there being no indication on the website that the room linked with the chosen date was inaccessible. Hopefully, this is something which can be improved for the future. The eye test chair is removed for my test so that I can back my wheelchair into the space, and this negates the need for transferring (which I can no longer do). If you have an eye test booked upstairs, then it can be accessed by the back door which is easy to get to by going through the alleyway – although it is quite narrow. The shop is quite difficult to navigate with a wheelchair due to the limited space. I've got to be very careful when maneuvering past all of the equipment which is quite difficult especially when I need a new pair of glasses lol.

All bedlinen,  towels, crockery, in fact the whole Kit caboodle!!  We were in the Kiel Lodge which allows dogs and they even provided the ground stake that you  attach your dogs collar to. The lodge itself is very spacious with large doors with the lounge / kitchen in an open  plan style.  Entry to the main users room is by double opening doors with a access to hoists and any other equipment you may need ! The decor is modern  with fantastic lighting first rate Smeg appliances and comfortable seating! Basically a home from home  that is anything but basic, in fact Homeland matches, if not surpasses anything I have ever seen before - it's incredible!  On first look at the pricing it may seem expensive, however if you have the 6 allowed (or 8) then it becomes a bargain.  We would wholeheartedly recommend this facility to anyone that has struggled to find a base for a holiday that is so hard too find for a disabled user. You really Must give Homelands a try !!

The chair I was provided with was fantastic for the terrain and enabled me to go wherever I wanted independently. The gentleman Frederico met me at the hotel lobby at the time arranged and as he was running late we left the chair in the lobby with reception for collection. I am quite small and of course rental chairs are generally larger than ones I require but we found it very easy to use pillows and my own cushions from my manual wheelchair to make it suitable - however it maybe necessary that certain extra cushions are taken to make the chairs fit every individual. The chair we hired was a Terra which I'd not heard of before but was definitely the best electric wheelchair I've hired abroad. It had a great range, managed small kerbs and bumps with ease, had a small wheelbase with great turning circle and fitted on all the buses easily. It definitely made the holiday a holiday for all. I'd definitely recommend Amigo 24 for any electric wheelchair hire in the future if we end up in an area that they operate in. They also hire out manual wheelchairs and mobility scooters as well as other mobility and disability aids which can be incredibly handy and helpful whilst away on holiday.

The Limes was standing here from the late 1800’s, , but the present family run Tudor style hotel was established in 2006 when Mr David Morris purchased the hotel, and with a 1.5 million pound project, added many more bedrooms, and installed a restaurant and bar, and developed the grounds, so that today we see a very nice hotel that stands in 6 acres of tended well maintained grounds with a cottage like olde worlde feel about its Tudor kept buildings that offers character and warmth. You have free parking, with we believe 27 bedrooms that offer plain simple nicely decorated rooms, and pictures found on internet show that many have showers, with a small step, good sized well appointed modern beds, and most certainly clean and well looked after. The bar lounge is a pleasant comfortable place to sit and enjoy a coffee break, or later on, a most enjoyable cocktail, which we can recommend, and the Admirals restaurant offers an extensive enough menu that will delight you, as you gaze across the garden view. An after dinner stroll across the grounds to the far pool will Offer a pleasant experience, with a walk across compressed chippings on its pathways through well maintained grounds.  OUR REVIEW Our arrival was easy enough after driving through open countryside and the gateway was a nice looking entrance, but husband not so impressed with the compressed chippings on the driveway. But there is a reasonable well maintained car park. (photo 1) while there are bays nearer the hotel entrance which disabled may use, (photo 2) overlooking a small pond and over to the Tudor style country lodge. The main entrance was not clearly signed, so not sure how to get in, it has a pull handle doorway with a small tread to get over (3) and you pass a very plain small box like affair, just a practical reception (4) which leads to the bar, (5) always a focal point of attraction. We sat in the lounge and there are very comfortable and relaxing seats in the open lounge area  6) as you order a drink or two. While waiting, we looked into the Admirals restaurant (photo 7) which looked very pleasant and well maintained furniture (8)  When weather permits a small terrace would make for a delightful break (9) or perhaps choose to sit on the lawn on the benches available (10).  A pathway leads across to pass the marquee (11) and on towards the chippings that holds the path to take you across to the far pool, while the very impressive marquee holds promise of some delightful weddings taking place here (12) which looks inviting, spacious and well looked after (13). Inside hotel, a nice small functions room is available for those special occasions (14), However our special treat was to enjoy a cocktail (15) while we admired the open fireplace and wood burner (16) which brightened up the day. A short corridor led to toilets (17) which are just basic and with minimal fuss (18). After our cocktail we ventured outside again to view the bedrooms, located in refurbished cottages (19) before departing this delightful lodge.

9741,41424,Overview,5.0,"Ripley Castle is situated in the heart of Ripley Village, it is accessible by car or public transport (number 36 bus running between Leeds and Ripon) and situated approximately 4 miles from Harrogate, North Yorkshire.  In addition to the castle the visitor amenities in the village include a small general shop, tearooms, a pub and restaurant, the Church, a large car park on the outskirts of the village, a small art gallery and two gift shops all within a very pleasant and scenic setting.  The village is level and has a mixture of tarmac and cobblestoned roads and pavements.     Disabled parking spaces (x 3) can be found adjoining the tearooms (opposite the castle entrance) or next to the castle wall a few metres from the entrance (x 3).  The terrain between these spaces and the entrance is level and either tarmac from the tearooms or cobbles from the castle wall – this section of parking also has access via a single lane, quiet road that runs adjacent to the cobbles.  The castle is accessible through the gift shop which has a level, hard surface floor and suitable door widths for wheelchair access.  The merchandise is set out to allow wide aisles between displays and the path through the shop to the castle entrance is not obstructed.  The entrance to the castle is at the back of the shop where there is a disabled toilet with suitable circulation for a wheelchair user.  A four-wheeled motorised scooter is available to reserve (recommended pre-booking) although motorised scooters are not allowed in the castle building, electric wheelchairs are permitted in the castle with prior advice.  A manual wheelchair is available for use during the castle tour.  The surface from the entrance to the castle and terrace is compacted gravel and although a hard surface would be easier this is manageable for wheelchair use.  The gardens are largely accessible with a variety of hard surface paths, signposted, permanent ramps between the terrace and the gardens and double gates with a level threshold between the general grounds and the walled gardens.  The deer park and lake walk is not advised for wheelchair users as the terrain is general parkland/grass fields, undulating and with stone steps leading back up to the terrace. There is no wheelchair access into the hothouses although wheelchair users are able to pass through the hothouse entrance to access the wooded areas of the grounds.  The main entrance to the castle is ramped and fully accessible to wheelchair users, the tour consists of six rooms of which four are on the ground floor.  There is no lift so visitors with limited mobility can watch a DVD that shows the tour information for the upstairs.   Hearing loops are available and can be requested in advance, and visitors with visual impairment are encouraged to handle objects throughout the tour.

This was about the third time i've been to this one and not in a long time... I hate doing reviews like this, it just left me shocked...nearly in tears had to go to the disabled loos to calm. Let me explain, I came into the store with my friend who also wears a sunflower lanyard hidden disabilities and immediately triped over the wet floor signs that were right in the middle of the entrance area.  (My friend had already gone down an isle)... No one asked if I was ok, even the member of Sainsburys staff who was stood doing one of them little taster things, nope nothing... when I warned it might be hazardous she just shrugged and went ok... maybe help with someone who has Autism, ADHD etc! Glad I wasn't using a cane, stick or blind!...   Although they did help when I had to chat to someone regarding something else I couldn't find. Sorry this is such a bad start, other than that the isles were large enough for wheel chairs and minus the good spaced disabled loo being the only one to use for everyone it went ok.

9780,29748,Overview,5.0,"Troon Swimming Pool offers great facilities and accessibility for people with a disability. From the outside of the building, there is clearly marked disabled driving spaces providing lots of space. Next to these, you can see on the left of the building there is a ramp and automatic door creating access to the building. The door is wide enough for wheelchair access and the ramp has a steady, safe incline. Once in the building, you can see disabled toilets and the doors to the gym and swimming pool viewing area have automatic doors at the press of a button. The reception desk is also low enough for anyone on a wheelchair to comfortably talk and interact with people behind the desk. One issue however could be that the doors to the changing rooms, both male and female, do not have automatic doors which could be a problem. This would be in the interest of customer hygiene. In the swimming pool changing rooms there is great disabled changing facilities and shower with lots of space and hoist available on request. There could however, be a tight fit pushing a wheelchair down to the bottom of the changing room as a wooden bench limits access and could cause an issue. In the swimming pool area, there are two chairs available to lower you into both swimming pools.

Helpful floor stickers direct you to lifts.   Audio announcements tell you the destination of the train and the next station. A dot-matrix indicator gives the same information in visual form.   Each train has several spacious wheelchair spaces, with wheelchair-symbol stickers by the appropriate doors. There is an alarm button by the wheelchair space, low enough to reach if you were to fall over on the floor.

But if you continue ahead instead, you reach the rather attractive old buildings of Solihull, with smaller shops inviting you in (photo 9) and here, if you have not popped in for a quick drink at the Inn, then turn around and walk back along the shops (10) before going back into Touchwood and return to your car  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS We certainly like it, we go back again and again, we just like Solihull. There are interesting shops, all the usual brand names, it’s always busy with character and well looked after, clean and inviting. You have the choice of being indoors or go outside for a nice bit of fresh air, there are big shops and small intimate shops, places to stop and have a drink, and it’s nice and compact",solihull solihull,positive,1,1

Arrival:  There are 2 disabled parking spaces near to the access ramp to the hotel.  Parking spaces are reservable, free of charge, for blue badge holders.  There is no low check-in desk, although Guest Services manager sat a lower desk so could check you in there.  No PEEP was completed or information on emergency evacuation.

Staff in the hotel, however, are extremely helpful and with make sensible suggestions to assist (eg seating us close to the breakfast buffet)  Room:  The room (5) was spacious with a walk in shower (2-3cm step)  There were handrails.  There was plenty of room to manoeuvre the wheelchair.  As this was not designated a 'accessible room' there were no emergency pull cords.  Spa:  Access to the Spa is down in a lift and along a corridor with a heavy door at one end - The step-free route is not signed so we had to ask the way.  There are no disabled changing rooms (that we could see).  The pool has steps in with a handrail (rather than a ladder), but no hoist.  Treatment rooms are through another set of doors, but the Spa therapist accompanies clients here so they can hold doors.

The cottage was provided with everything we needed and the owner met us on our arrival to show us around. There were plenty of bedrooms to accommodate us all, all furnished to a high spec and some bedrooms with ensuite so granny could have her own walk in shower. Along with central heating  there is a wood burner in the lounge to keep you warm,  but make sure you use dried wood as the bag of logs from the local garage was damp and didn't light easily or give off much heat, so a quick search of a DIY shop in Swansea produced  some lovely dry logs which made all the difference. The lounge was a little on the small side for the number of us, but there was an electric recliner armchair which granny enjoyed using. Kitchen is well equipped and spacious. The garage contained beach access equipment but you would need to discuss  use/hire with the owner.  The garden is lovely with a stream running through it and also through a goldfish pond. There are lights all around it for evening use. Plenty of seating and space to watch wildlife and birds feeding at the bird table. The driveway has a small slope up to the garage but this wasn't a problem for us.  We took our large dog, he slept in the garage, and there are fields and beaches nearby for walks The location is a quiet country road near to Rhossili village and famous beach.  The bedroom for our young boy was well equipped with hoist straight into the ensuite bathroom. Only minor gripe would be that we had to change him on the bed after hoisting him from the bath, so we had to put down protective sheets to stop the bedding getting wet. The hospital bed worked fine and he slept well. Although the weather was cold we enjoyed our stay, it worked well for our large family and different needs and hope to return again.

Firstly the lack of signage for the disabled parking got us off to a bad start and then the bays were hardly big enough to be classed disabled. The courtyard disabled toilet was a joke unless you were an octopus.  Trying to open the door, keep it open and control my mobility scooter was an art and coming out was even worse.  Thank God for helpful visitors to the ladies toilet opposite who held the door open for me. Access to most of the Castle is up (or down steps) so impossible.  The only area you can access is the Great Hall and I would say thank you to the shop and Hall staff who were very friendly and got me on and off the lift. The booklet says The Conservatory is wheelchair friendly but you struggle to find the way in, again signage is very poor!   The choice of food was poor and expensive no hot food and a choice of about 4 sandwiches. The trail to the River Island to watch the jousting was a no go one way over and so steep.  So I missed that one.

Accessible Toilets and cafes at the Lagoon and at the Kelpies visitor centre (although the cafe at the Lagoon is seasonal opening).  Only 2 real downsides for us: 1) access to the canal towpath is really steep and whilst just about possible with a lot of huffing and puffing by the pusher, it's not really that accessible which is a real shame as the canal path itself is great; 2) no chance to hire a mobility scooter which would be a real bonus.

10170,39259,Overview,3.5,"A group of us from MindforYou met here for lunch.  There were three elderly dementia guests with their carers and three staff.  One guest had a wheelchair and the disabled access was very good and the staff were very accommodating.   We booked a table in advance as we were a group of nine and it was a good job we did as it was extremely busy in the restaurant!  Perhaps it was because it was a Monday as the queue to get food was very long and we had to wait quite a long time.  However the food was lovely, although a little pricey and after lunch we walked around the garden centre.  There is a huge selection of plants, trees, fruit and vegetables to admire and indoors there is a lovely selection of homeware, gifts, clothes etc.  So easy to spend a fortune!   The only down side were the toilets which were not in the restaurant and were outside.  As we had one guest in a wheelchair, this proved quite time consuming.  There is disabled car parking right next to the garden centre but with only with limited spaces.  We weren't able to get one of these unfortunately so had to park in the outer car park which was harder work pushing the wheelchair.

If you are coming from the Millennium Bridge, when you approach St Paul's, you are directly facing the south side where the step free entrance is.  There is step free access via the lift to the cathedral floor and crypt. There is also step free access to the quire, by a user-operated chairlift on the north side, or alternatively 3 steps.   Later in 2019, 2 permanent ramps and a staircase with handrails, will be built on the north side of the cathedral, which will then become an additional public entrance to the cathedral. When I visited I saw the model and pictures for this, see photos.  I had a special tour round the cathedral and crypt area by Ann. She was amazing as I learnt so much about the history and architecture of the building. She pointed out things that I might not have noticed otherwise and she had lots of fun facts and anecdotal stories. She showed me the best place to view the interior of the dome and we also went behind the cordon and sat in the quire stalls, which was very special indeed.   On the way round we also talked about access. The cathedral offer touch tours for people with visual impairments and she showed me the Henry Moore statute, which is one of the statues featuring on the touch tour. They also offer BSL tours. There’s an induction loop on the cathedral floor and crypt. They offer braille and large print booklets for services. Assistance dogs are welcome.   When I visited the cathedral was busy, but it is also spacious so it’s easy to find a quiet spot away from the crowds and noise. There is also lots of seating in the nave. In the nave look out for the grating on the floor, see photo.  In the crypt the lighting levels are a bit lower and some of the floor is uneven due to memorials or mosaics flooring.

The accessible features on board, coupled with the enthusiastic nature of the staff and volunteers, makes for a terrific and unique experience. No two voyages are the same and this review is a summary review of all my experiences on board.   Features include four accessible toilets on board (two on deck and two 'down below), numerous bed hoists and height-adjustable beds, stair lifts throughout to all levels, height-adjustable tables and chairs, wheelchair ascender devices (to support wheelchair users to climb the mast), tactile markings, audio compass, hearing loops, and clear signage (I've probably forgotten something!). As well as all of that, the deck layout of the ship is designed so that every 'job' on board is accessible at wheelchair user height.   I found that the staff and volunteers on board have a 'can do' attitude and people focus on what you can do rather than what you can't. I've seen everyone from wheelchair users and quadruple amputees climb the mast, along with visually impaired and hearing impaired people too. I love the JST experience as it made me feel truly free.  This isn't a sailing 'holiday' as you're part of running the ship, so you're involved with everything from helming and sail setting to cooking and cleaning. Not for the faint hearted or for those who love sitting by a pool!   One thing worth noting - and the reason it's 4.5/5 and not 5 - is that neither of the JST's ship can accommodate power chairs at present. ",sts lord nelson southampton,positive,1,1

Those bits were all covered off with a platform lift to get to the stills, a lift to go up to the tasting room. The guide leading the way and explaining the stories of the whisky process and the exhibits to hand. Be it a sniff of the horns to capture a whisky aroma, a peek into the doocot to see a precious barrel or a stroll up to the Gin Cottage to see the marvels of gin production.  The visit started on an excellent footing as the doors were swung open and a warm welcome as we were greeted by a guide. A clear explanation of what was to be seen and the layout set us up for a good visit. We ventured off on a tour and were soon captivated by the stories, sights and smells.   Unusually, this was not a glimpse from the distance to see the beauty of the copper stills as a sizeable platform lift took me and my chair up to see the whisky process up close, from big mash tuns, to the stills and the slow flowing of the heads of the spirit I got to see it all.  A short distance away we entered the blending room / tasting room where a wee dram could be sampled - driving as I was I opted to take away my dram for later!  The distillery had a surprise in store for us as we expected the whisky side of things but were delighted to be able to go to the adjacent 'Gin Cottage' - literally what it says - a cottage carefully converted to house the gin production. The gin distilling and the copper was fascinating and whilst being a tool was indeed a work of art. Here too was an opportunity for a tasting; so one more sample to take away.   Our tour ended in the spacious shop where there were lots of bottles and associated gifts and wares to purchase. From here we couldn't resist the temptation of the cafe.

It should be a spectacular review and it would be if they could get the service right. I have been twice now and the service is amateurish. To sit you down and not give you a drinks menu is a schoolboy error. The staff spend most of their time by the kitchen which is out of sight from the main dining area. They forget a lot of stuff.

11348,49213,Access,2.5,"The main barrier to accessibility here is the cobble stones and dirt ground that are found at various locations around the Alhambra. These are hazardous if you are unsteady on your feet or you use a wheeled mobility aid. The larger the cobble stones the rougher the ride. Seating was very limited too. The route shown on the Alhambra map that you can get from the entrance or online is really the only route you can take if you can’t climb stairs.   But none of it is possible if you can’t walk or wheel over cobble stones and uneven ground.   I annotated a map and attached it as a photo and then described the route I took below in the order I took it.  To Nasrid Palace - At the beginning of the path is a section of large cobble stones (c. 50m) and benches. We followed the route through the Medina gardens which were beautiful and offered more views of the wider area. The gardens themselves had some steps to access them off the main path. Onwards past the church is a downhill section, which brought me to some canons. The views from here were also spectacular. However there was no dropped curb up onto the cobbled path from which to take in the views. So I had to go towards the Puerta de Justicia to get the ramp up on to it. Beyond that were the toilets, which were surrounded by more large cobble stones. From the cobbles there was a dirt path to the ticket checkpoint for Nasrid Palace.  In Nasrid Palace - This was the highlight of the visit for me. I asked a steward where I needed to go and she told me that we could jump to the front of the queue at our allotted time (entrance to this is pre-bookable only). From there we were escorted down a ramp, which I can only describe as like being on a horse. The anti-slip strips were big and I was bouncing up and down. We were taken into the Palace through a separate entrance with ramps. Once inside I was able to move through the one way system nicely on the scooter. Some of the side rooms were only accessible by flights of five or so steps so I got up and walked around one of them. There was still a lot to see without going in those rooms. We were guided by friendly staff through a separate accessible route. All in all I was impressed by how much I could access given the age and delicate nature of the building. I nearly drove into a water feature that was recessed into the floor. I can see why they dont allow pushchairs. Im sure I missed out on seeing some other areas of the Palace but I was satisfied on the day.  To the Generalife gardens - note that there is no step-free access to the Palace along the garden route shown on the map. There is a flat dirt avenue with more spectacular views. From there the route passes across the amphitheater to the toilets and then up a steep ramp to the garden level. Once at the entrance to the gardens, cobble stones begin. However, the stones are small, tightly packed and mostly even so I was able to scoot over them without much vibration. In the garden there are many benches to sit on and admire the trees, herbs and wildflowers, and the water features. At the end of the garden there are flights of steps to the Palace but no ramps. I really enjoyed this area.  To the Generalife Palace - the first part of the wide dirt road up to the Palace is steep and long, and leads to a narrow long flat section of large cobble stones. It was a rough. I don’t recall there being any seating along the way. Once at the Palace, I found a member of staff to let me in through a separate entrance. Once inside the door, the access stops there. I could still see the amazing architecture and water features from here. There are a few small individual steps from that point around the ground floor and I was able to walk around a little to look at the views out of the arches. We saw the Nasrid Palace and Alcazaba below which was quite spectacular. The space is tight with lots of people so it would be a challenge in a wheelchair, if you were able to overcome the steps. To get to other levels there are also lots of steps. I think if my time had been limited I would have thought the effort to get there wasn’t worth it.  I didn’t record anything about aids for hearing or seeing. The maps and signposts were not all that helpful because the route is different for disabled people.

11415,10967,Transport & Parking,3.0,"The large car park for Longparke is situated beside the building and has 3 accessible parking spaces right outside the entrance. The ground of the car park is covered in grey gravel which was challenging for my powerchair, especially in thicker areas. Luckily, beside the accessible parking spaces there was paved slabs at eithers sides of the space. This is great because it’s a smoother surface for people to transfer to their wheelchairs, walk on or drive on. Unfortunately, though I exit my car from the back where there’s no paved slabs but, I managed to drive through the gravel and get on to the slabs. If there were no accessible spaces available wheelchair users may struggle to visit because of the gravel all around the other spaces, also parking spaces aren’t marked so there’s the problem of others parking too close. Accessible parking isn’t easily sign posted when you first enter the car park but, it’s usually near entrances so that’s where we headed.  Dobbies Garden Centre is beside Longparke and there is a bus stop there. However, when you walk from Dobbies to Longparke, you would struggle to cross over the road because there is no dipped kerb. You would also need to walk up the road to Longparke because there is no pavement. The same problem would also occur with the gravel in the car park.

11485,52034,Overview,4.0,"The Grange was built in 1900 by Joseph Hinks, a lamp manufacturer from Birmingham, and with his wife Francis, had seven children. Joseph and his father James ran their lamp business from 91 Great Hampton street. During 1900 he leased land, and at a rather high cost, built Chesford Grange, and the family lived here until 1908. The new owner, Lord Algeron Malcolm Arthur Percy, who later became an MP.  bought the Grange for his daughter Katherine Percy, who in 1904 had married Josceline Reginald Heber-Percy. (Interesting, we have just reviewed the village of Hodnet in Shropshire for you all, which belonged to another part of the Heber-Percy family line ) The second son of the 6th Duke of Northumberland, Lord Algeron Percy had married lady Victoria Edgecombe in 1880, and he remained an MP until 1887, when he decided to make his home at Guys Cliffe his permanent home. His only son, also a Algeron Percy, who would inherit Guys Cliffe, was killed at the battle of Jutland in 1916, and later, his daughter Katherine, moved from Chesford Grange, so as to be able to look after her aged parents. Following the death of her father, Katherine inherited Guys Cliffe in 1933.  So by late 1924 Henry Pratt became the owner of Chesford Grange, and the family lived here until 1938. Later that year, the Hames family lived here, and with lots of hard work, following a period of time that the house had been left empty and uninhabited, the family lived in part of the Grange, while successfully developing other areas as a hotel and restaurant. During the Second World War, the department of war took over the house. It later  became a borstal institute, before becoming a hotel again, and it is known that by 1956 a mr Richardson was running the hotel. The Grange then changed hands a number of times over the next few years, until recently bought over by the Qhotels group.  OUR REVIEW. (THE PHOTOS WE SHOW MAKE THE HOTEL LOOK BETTER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS ) We were very disappointed to see that Qhotels group have done next to nothing to improve the exterior areas of this Grange, it’s just as we last reviewed it, and in need of a make over, and that applies also to the interior areas, it’s much the same old, same old. Certainly nothing seems to have been done to improve things for disabled, it is still hard work to get around to certain areas of the hotel.  What was once a lovely old building, but now badly in need of repair work and painting, it’s such a shame to see the place in the state it is in (photo 1) but photo  makes it look much better than it is, close inspection of photo will show you what we  mean.  There are three disabled bays available (photo 2) by the front entrance, and a brick ramp leads to the front door, a push and pull entry (3) on the level now. A wide reception area which is quite light and airy (4) and a warm welcome from staff.  Round the corner, a plain well stocked bar (5) with an entry that leads into a cafe like casual eating area. (6). We sat in a small lounge area with room for wheelchair (7) and next to this a corridor that leads to public toilets (8) but no disabled toilet seen. These are plain usual ordinary toilets (9). A nice stone fireplace with a few more comfortable seating opposite the bar (10). Leads into a very plain Lino tiled flooring were you can enjoy a light lunch or hot drinks, while over looking the terrace and gardens (11). For disabled to get to terrace, leave the bar and go down the ramp (photo 12) and then around a number of tight corners on the ramp, which will lead you into the restaurant (13) which is very plain, unappealing (14). A doorway ahead leads to the terrace (15) with Rattan seating, very pleasant area to sit while enjoying the sun trap (16).  To reach the lovely shaded garden there are steps (17) and impossible for chairs. To get back into restaurant, there are unkempt steps (18) or retrace your steps through restaurant and follow ramp and it’s turns.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS It’s a disappointing shame that it’s not a looked after property, as it’s a comfortable old place so such a shame to see it neglected.",chesford grange kenilworth,positive,1,1

11597,28795,Overview,4.0,"I took my oldest daughter as my carer. When we were trying to find the venue we found staff wandering around the local area promoting (Underbelly staff wear purple tshirts, the venues have purple entrances) so we asked for directions. The staff from that point on were attentive and knew what they were talking about which is always a plus. Once we got to the door we needed, (which were signposted with names of cows) I saw stairs and my heart sank. 2 members of staff saw us and told us that the access ramp was round the corner, it's actually a solid concrete slope rather than a mobility ramp and even that reassured me that access has been considered. The member of staff who escorted us to our seats took us through the door and round the back of the stage, it's pretty dark but the access is clear and the staff member led the way. When we got into the actual room they'd already worked out where to seat us so there was no fuss or panic. We were about 5 rows back and to be honest as the show started I was glas we were not closer to the stage as the action takes place on a screen suspended from the ceiling. My manual chair reclines but I didn't think about that and not everyone has that function.  When the performance started there were 4 people centre stage, a lady to one side on a computer and a 3 piece band on the other side of the stage. I had no idea what to expect and that's part of the Festival experience. Manual Cinema come from Chicago and at the end they took time to meet the audience and answer questions about their 'craft'. That's not something all performers do, but it's something I appreciate, I usually have questions and can't get answers. They actually didn't design the show with disabled awareness in mind, but it works. The screen being higher than heads means I could see everything without stretching or craning my neck. I didn't need to ask the people in front of me to move to accomodate me.   The stage is visible and the performers move around which adds something to 'just' the puppet type shadow work on the screen above, I was watching the 4 operators put the screen overlays on the overhead projectors to create the scenes and the people acting at the same time and then could see it all come together on the screen above. Very subtle and really effective. The lady operating the computer for lighting and effects sang too and her voice was lovely.  The musicians added drama and tempo nicely which is also great to watch. I saw Lula Del Ray which was a touching story about a girl's dreams and her relationship with her mum, her imagination and music. I like pieces which encourage thinking or self exploration so the style used was really effective for this. Puppetry is often seen as for kids, or passe, but there was something contemporary and fresh about their approach.  When the show was over again staff were efficient and helpful to make sure we were looked after, and the Venue Manager asked if everything had been what we'd expected as we left. To that point it all was.  Unfortunately, when I went to use the toilet after the show I found an area for improvement, the accessible toilet is small, I struggled to turn my manual chair to get in and out, on the way out the door and my chair had a fight 4 times before I was clear to get out. There is another toilet with a disabled sign, but it's a gents and there's no disabled toilets or adaptions to help. I did point this out to staff who were apologetic but not sure what solutions could be offered. The additional toilets in the quad outside have steps, they are portacabin style ones so I think there's potential to put an accessible one there. I'd be really concerned about taking a power chair or larger manual in to that toilet (mine is a 30"") but I was unable to find an alternative. ",edinburgh underbelly edinburgh,positive,1,1

It seems you can't use a CEA card at the machines. The lift hasn't had an upgrade sadly and is still very small and difficult to turn in, but it does the job!   There was a lower til but no one came to serve us there so I went to a normal til which was too high so my friend had to do everything for me, it's actually taller than the old tills. This would be fine if staff asked wheelchair users if they would like to be served at the lower till, as I'm guessing that's what its for.  EDIT: I went to see another film already and was served again at a high til. I asked about the lower area and asked if this was for wheelchair users, the staff member was very nice and said she guesses so, so I asked if wheelchair users can be seen there instead then as the desk is too tall and she just agreed that the other tills were too high. So it seems they are reluctant or unable to easily move tils and the lower bit is not manned.   Now for the actual cinema... SO much better! The first thing I noticed when we reached out screen room was the sets of doors were further apart which was a great improvement for getting through in my wheelchair. When you get through the doors the isle up to the seats is on a slope and there are handrails at each side. The isles are well lit and in screen 1, the wheelchair spaces are a few rows back from the screen- I prefer to be a little further back and not so close to the screen. There are little lights on the floor with the wheelchair symbol and seat number. I decided to get out my wheelchair and try out the new luxe seats and couldn't believe how comfy they were, like sitting on a cloud! There is a tray table that moves and has a cup holder, and arm rests that lift up. On the inside of the left arm there are flat black buttons, on pressing these the leg rests slowly rises and lifts your legs up effortlessly, then the back rest starts to recline. It was so comfy I could have slept there! There are less seats in the cinema and more space, it is well lit and easy to move about in.   The cinema have showings with audio descriptions. There are also showings with captions which are listed separately online. There are Autism Friendly showings on Sunday mornings specifically designed for those with sensory processing issues; the lights and sounds are lower, there are no trailers or adverts, and more allowance for increased levels of movement and noise  All screens have step free access.

11763,56217,Overview,4.0,"We have already reviewed four hotels for you that belong to the Handpicked group of hotels, and they really are delightful hotels, 5 stars the norm, so we were really looking forward to our overnight stay at Nutfield Priory. What a disappointment ! It started off well, the driveway towards the hotel looked great, (photo 1) spring flowers opening up, well cut and maintained grounds, and the old building looked  historical and grand (photo 2) the tower of the entrance guarding the hall, old chimney pots looked magnificent, we were ready (3). We parked opposite the entrance in one of the two disabled bays (4) and headed for the hotels entrance, and found a step waiting for us. (5) No ramp in sight, so my husband had to get up out of his wheelchair, and stagger up the step.  Inside we were greeted by two very friendly receptionist ,and who turned out during our stay to be very kind and helpful, and the reception area looked old but pleasing enough (photo 6) Booking in was soon done and we would be escorted up to ,our room on the second floor, and we were pleased to be told that a lift was available, which was situated behind the reception desk, through a very narrow doorway and small tight square passage (photo 7 shows the entrance behind the lamp) with a turn to get wheelchair into the small lift, where my husband continually seemed to catch his hands against the lifts edges, causing him to scrape his hands, and wipe the blood off his knuckles. A corridor led to our bedroom (8) number 25, and pleased to see we could leave wheelchair by front door (9) and the room looked very nice (10) with nice big bed for us, ( BUT THE ROOM WAS FREEZING) the cast iron radiator was not working, so we tried to sort the heating out by putting setting to high on wall panel and hoped this would warm the room up. There was plenty of room to move around (11) and in  walk-in bathroom we had soft white towels and pleased to see pull cord connected to call button (12) while the walk in shower was plenty big enough for us (13) Right, time to investigate Nutfield Priory. We took chair into the large delightful drawing room (photo 14) with lovely glass framed windows offering plenty of light, and saw the 1874 restored organ which suited its place in the historical hotel (15), (BUT AGAIN IT WAS FREEZING IN THERE) the fire, set in the original fireplace was ( not lit until the next day ) (photo 16). The side doorway would lead into the bar lounge with its small but nicely wooden bar (17) which took us to see the delightful restaurant (18) which was nicely laid ready for dining tonight. The old wooden panelled library was interesting and looked authentic (20)  and would be a pleasant quiet place to enjoy reading one of the many books and catch up with the history of Nutfield Priory.  HISTORY It was difficult to find the early history of the Priory, but we believe it was once a home built for Monks, so our history continues from records of 1849, when this original mansion was rebuilt by Thomas Fowlerwood. From 1855 a banker, Henry Edward Gurney added much improvements to enhance this mansion, until he was declared bankrupt, so the property was sold to Joshua Fielden who was once an MP in Lancashire, and he basically rebuilt the property, to include the Tower. He had 11 children with his wife Ellen, and he was known as a caring man who sought the interest and welfare of others. When Joshua died in 1887 Nutfield was held in trust for his wife Ellen, until 1920 when she sold the property.  It was then sold to a Mr Ferris, who lived here until 1930, then under the care of  Mr O Picton Davies he turned the property into what we start to see today, a very expensive hotel, and he included  nine hole golf course by the lake. Over the next few years a number of changes were made in how the mansion was being used, until its opening as a boarding school for deaf children, but this closed in 1987, and a year later it opened up as a hotel again. It is now under the care of Handpicked hotels.  To continue with our details of hotel for you, and why we were so disappointed with our visit.  It seemed to us that Handpicked Hotels have allowed Nutfield Priory to have that look of neglect, and has been allowed to go downhill for some years now. Paint has stripped off woodwork, the stained panels and doors need work to be done on them, carpets have threadbare areas and joints are separating and look tired. The general appearance is not up to the standard of other Handpicked Hotels we have visited and reviewed for Euans guide in which we gave top marks for, so having paid so much money and so looking forward to staying here, it was quite a shock to see the place so neglected. And worse of all, the whole building was SO COLD, there was no heat on anywhere, and we froze in our room. We were of course given the usual rubbish, our maintenance manager checked the heat this morning and it was working,) just how  many times have we heard that, and other guest were also deeply concerned that we all had to feel so cold. It’s not cheap to stay at Handpicked Hotels, so all in all, a big disappointment for us personally.  Out next visit for the groups hotels will be to Rookery Hall, and we do so hope that will bring back our confidence in handpicked Hotels. Mind you, may we say thank you to the young receptionist on duty that evening, she tried so hard for us to get warmth, she took the time and trouble to spend an hour hunting around the hotel to find heaters for us, and kindly brought up two heaters to our room, so that on waking the next morning we had a warm room, so thanks goes to her for her effort on our behalf.   OUR FINAL THOUGHTS About our part one review of Nutfield Priory hotel.  Leaving our disappointment behind, this could again become an interesting and historical hotel, it’s got a lot going for it, and if you read part two and our part three, you will see that we have offered far more favourable remarks on our visit here, but it’s just at the moment, until management get the hotel back up To a standard we expect from Handpicked hotels, then we shall not be recommending you visiting or staying here.",nutfield priory hotel spa redhill,positive,1,1

What I found was brilliant: it was a fully accessible venue, laid out over an open street plan with grassy areas to sit and accessible toilets. All grassy areas had edgings around them, but they also had ramps situated at strategic points to ensure wheelchair users could access the grassy areas for some sun worshiping (it was a cracking day!). The main stage (the only stage I visited, so I can't comment for others) had a BSL interpreter for all acts and interim crowd entertainers, it seemed to be the same BSL interpreter all day though so I'm sure she must've been exhausted by the end of it! The ramps, coupled with the provision of accessible toilets and Mobiloo being on-site made for an extremely enjoyable experience. The only reason I've not given it 5-stars is because some of the steps didn't have highlights on them so, as a visually impaired person, I sometimes found it a bit challenging navigating those.

The path to the house was mainly paved and flat and wasn’t too rough for my wheelchair .  The house itself is currently only open downstairs all of which was wheelchair accessible. Floors are generally smooth with a few carpets which may be a little difficult for manual wheelchairs . Larger wheelchairs may also need to take care as one or two doorways where a little tight .  The cafe was good with lots of choice including vegan options however you have to access the cafe through the courtyard which can be a bit of a rough ride . Please note if you are on your own and wish to use the outdoor seating transporting your food will be difficult as this seating is located back across through the courtyard and over the cobbles.  To the right of the cafe there is the kitchen garden. For me this was very accessible with paved flat paths with gentle slopes throughout .There was lots to see and was very interesting definitely the highlight of my trip !  The main gardens are accessed via a path by the house . Upon arrival we were given a map and told to follow the red route as we were told this has step free access throughout and is suitable for wheelchairs . However the paths in the gardens at the back of the house were mainly small stones which was bumpy and not a smooth ride .The pathways are not marked clearly and better signage is really needed here. We tried to follow the map provided but we did end up on a path that was steep , extremely rocky and not suitable for wheelchairs !  The terrain and hill made my wheelchair skid and I needed a lot of help to navigate these paths. Whether this path was part of the red route or not was unclear but I wouldn’t recommend the main gardens due to the paths in general not being very smooth and at times narrow to. The price of a ticket was £11 which included the house and gardens . I did not see any discount for disabled however I think you can get a free carer/ companion in with you if you have the appropriate proof .  I visited here as I recently joined the national trust but I was a bit disappointed with this visit due to the lack of signage , the uneven bumpy paths and the facilities being somewhat difficult to visit .

When I went back downstairs to reception, after seeing my room, to talk to them about the shower, they were very approachable and went out of their way to fin a solution. They immediately checked their other rooms and also called their 2 sister hotels to see if they had an accessible room. They also suggested using the accessible shower room in the Genisis Health Suite. Initially I was not sure about this but it worked perfectly. They left a note on reception for someone to take me to the shower room when I telephoned them. This worked well. I really appreciated the staff's positive attitude to dealing with it, they were very customer focused and wanted to find a solution for me. The positive staff attitude was throughout my stay. Everyone from the front desk, waiting staff and cleaners always said hello and smiled when they saw me. The front desk always dealt with things quickly such as when I wanted to order a taxi or asking directions. The waiting staff were wonderful.

12249,584,Overview,1.0,"Friendly staff but sadly, this facility is not welcoming to those with visual and hearing impairment.    I use hearing aids and visited the building with a friend who has visual impairment. We both struggled to enjoy the experience because the building did not meet our needs.   The building was acoustically uncomfortable, excessively so. Two children were interacting with one of the installations and behaving perfectly appropriately, but the noise they generated spread and echoed off the walls. A few more people arrived and their chatter added to the noise. In total, it took just six people in the room to make it very uncomfortable for me.   There is a theatre and there is a hearing loop within it.  Great! BUT there is NO signage outside the theatre and only a VERY small sign inside, and it is on the far wall. I only spotted it because i have good eyesight and was looking. The loop itself seems of nice sound quality BUT the volume is set too low.  Another hearing aid user (who went in to check my view) agreed with this.   For those with visual impairment, there appears to be NO adjustment made to accommodate requirements.  There is a huge map, which is the main feature in the building and a digital tablet is provided to engage with it.  The font size is small and cannot be adjusted.  BAsically, it is usable for those with some degree of sight loss. It also requires people to have GOOD DEXTERITY because it is fiddly to use.   All the main installations come with written information. There is also information boards telling the story of Scotland's architectural heritage. The text is fairly small and there appears to be NO audio alternative.    I hope that facility managers will re-think their accessibiliy standards. I imagine that our every-increasing older population might find it interesting but given that most older people have some degree of hearing and / or sight loss, the building is pretty unsuitable for them.

There were two disabled bays right against the building, very awkward to park in place, as wanting to leave room for other cars to pass without damaging our car. There is drop down barrier, which indicates it’s a paying car park, but the two bays belong to hotel, and we were not charged, and did not have to register our car, but it’s a very grotty place, and difficult to turn round, as you have to go out via that narrow bridge entrance, so we were not impressed at all. Once inside hotel, we were very disappointed, it was dark throughout, ( I have tried to show this with the photographs ) badly in need of maintenance and re-decoration. It is a very old building and furniture was designed to keep that effect, which did not work and gave the hotel no appeal at all. The reception area was small and dark and dingy, very uninviting. We had coffee break in the lounge area by reception desk, and it looked dusty. The coffee itself was hot and strong, nicely presented, and we could sit and reflect that we were pleased we were not staying overnight here. The bar lounge was uninspiring, again dark and poorly lit, and not comfortable looking. The restaurant didn’t look to bad though, you might be tempted to try a meal here, but it lacked character.  The ladies and gents toilet were along a corridor, but I did not find a disabled toilet. They were not easy to get into, with pull handles which had to be pulled down, making it very difficult to get in to use toilets. Clean and tidy with one cubicle, for men, but practical more than stylish. The private function room was not appealing, and again dark.

FREE VIEWING ACCESS FROM TOWER HILL AND TOWER CONCOURSE:  I arrived about 8.15pm, so was there for the last 45 minutes of the evening. When I arrived the area was crowded. From Tower Hill I managed to get to the front of the railings and was able to look down on the installation from street level. This provided a good view, but there was a lower path with people on it so it felt a little distant. Also from street level at Tower Hill there are trees and shrubs so there is not an uninterupted view. I then walked round to the Tower Concourse. The Tower Concourse is on a slope. There are information boards here about the event, however there is no reference on them to accessibility. To view the moat from here there was a large queue, this was at 8.15pm, so I assume it may well have been even busier earlier on. The area is fenced off so it involves walking up and down the length of the concourse several times to reach the area adjacent to the moat. At the entrance to the fenced off area there was a steward, my disability is visable but she didn't offer an alternative route for me to take. Luckily when I got parallel to the exit, the steward saw me and opened the fence and let me through so I went via the exit. Looking down from the Tower Concourse there is no seats. I found a space to view and I decided to stay there for the rest of the evening and I found it deeply moving.",the tower of london london,negative,0,0

12379,34462,Overview,4.0,"This is part one of THREE reviews, do read the others for a full view of what’s available here.  Part ONE Resort World Birmingham, (includes review for Genting Hotel. Part TWO Miller and Carter Restaurant, ( our 5* star restaurant review)  Part THREE MOXY HOTEL  Arriving by train is the least complicated way to arrive here, although it involves quite a bit of walking for your carer. For train details (See our review, just search for NEC, then on location type in Birmingham, look for National exhibition centre, then look at Disabled Traveller for more details.   If arriving by train or car, again more on this below, on section Parking and Transport  options. DO READ THESE for advice.  PARKING COSTS. During December 2021 and until further notice, it will cost you £2.50 for two hour parking.   IF YOU GO OVER 2 hours then it will be £16.00 ouch However, if you spend £20.00 anywhere in World resort, say on shopping, or restaurants, take your parking ticket with you and get it stamped at the shop or restaurant, and you will then only have to pay the £2.50 cost of ticket.  Oh that’s better, and that lasts for 12 hours parking for you.  It’s a nice place to go and see, right by the NEC halls, and alongside a lovely lake,  there’s enough to do and see for a short visit, or simply to enjoy a longer stay with restaurants to fill you up. Our photos will guide you as to how to spend your time here, but it’s certainly interesting to check out. Having arrived by train you exit the NEC by the bus stops (photo 1) with a view across to Resort World (photo 2) then you can chose which path to follow to get you inside (photo 3).  Arriving by car, you park by the  “shops sign”. (photo 4) and take the lift up to level “0” (photo 5) and come out to walk along by shops (photo 6) then walk along towards the lift and escalator (photo 7) and here your enquiries can be answered at the Guest Services desk (photo 8).  Close by are toilets (photo 9) and there is a disabled toilet for you (photo 10) which is roomy, with grab rails and a pull cord.   The Resort has its own Hotel entrances (photo 11) the Genting Hotel (photo 12) and the reception desk is a classy elegant space (photo 13) with a nice place to sit and relax (photo 14) and at the far corner you will find disabled toilets (photo 15) which is spacious enough, nicely tiled, and of course clean, with grab rails and pull cord (photo 16).  But this is an unusual Hotel, it’s used just for your bedroom facilities, all meals are taken in one of the Resorts restaurant of your choice, your coffee breaks will have to be elsewhere, but it’s handy and well looked after, so perhaps that may not matter to you. You simply exit the Hotel by reception desk (photo 17) take a lift and go up to your rooms level (photo 18) and enjoy your stay.  We were not given permission or help to be able to see what the rooms are like, but we imagine that they would be very nice, as the rest of the Hotel is, so advising you as to staying here is difficult for us.  Our final thoughts Well worth a visit, pleasantly surprised at the low costs of shopping and dining, with enough to do to pass time away. We certainly would recommend the Miller and Carter restaurant to you, excellent food and drinks, with moderate prices as well. The Genting Hotel was very nice for what we were allowed to see. Remember, it does have a cinema, a bowling alley, many restaurants, and across the road an adventure park, so give it a try while in the area.   ",resorts world birmingham birmingham,positive,1,1

Level access - he can walk a few steps otherwise uses an attendant propelled chair or a mobility scooter. Homelands has level access and downstairs accommodation and bathrooms.  They provided a wheelchair and a mobility scooter both of which suited his needs. Dad is an oxygen user - Homelands are used to this, the oxygen company delivered his oxygen compressor and oxygen cannisters to the venue prior to our arrival and collected them afterwards. Dad uses a closomat type toilet at home - there was one on site that suited his needs. Dad needs a shower seat and level access wet room - provided Dad uses a profiling bed, height adjustable with cot rails - provided with plenty of cushions.  Dad uses a riser recline chair - provided. The living area was spacious with room for the wheelchair if needed.   The outside space was accessible and afforded a beautiful view of the golf course and coast.  We were a multi generational family group and there was lots of space for us and our day visitors to join us. There was enough space that dad did not feel overwhelmed by the children who were excited and loud at times - they played upstairs in the bedrooms or on the landing which itself is a beautiful space.  We found that we had everything we needed in terms of cutlery and utensils, we did eat and prepare large family meals.  If we felt we needed a particular thing it was just a case of searching and it did turn up - e.g. oven gloves, serving bowls etc.   When we were tidying up at the end we realised that there were baby monitors in one of the wardrobes - we could have used them so will remember that next time.   The only downside for us is that the venue is situated on a coastal hill in an oldish village.  Thus the pavements are not all easy to use a mobility scooter on.  Some of the cambers and slopes are quite steep.  Dad was able to get up to the little shops area but didn't fancy the road down to the golf course as it was too steep.

Recently whilst watching Mary Poppins Returns there was a constant rumble from an adjoining screen showing some block buster.  Then let's talk about accessibility. Screens 3, 4 and 5 are accessible. They are not on ground level. But there is a wheelchair lift to take you down the equivalent of 10 steps. So far so good. But be warned, it is quite a walk to a disabled toilet on this lower level.  I first visited in November and refurbishment was still on going in the two upstairs screens. I assumed that to comply with accessibility requirements Reel would put in a lift to upstairs. Wrong! The two upstairs screens can only be accessed via the stairs. No good for me. (Ambulant disabled) Let alone someone in a wheelchair   I queried this when I visited. The young guy on duty was clearly embarrassed. ""I'm sorry sir. All I can suggest is you contact us beforehand and we'll let you know if the screen is accessible.""  Such a pity.

It is a busy road though and I appreciated having hubby with me to help decide when it was safe to cross.   The top section of the path is quite steep and has a loose gravel surface. I was okay going down but huby had to help push back up as my wheels kept skidding under me. The rest of the path was good quality - concrete. There is a fence on the side where the drop is, which looks good quality but allows someone at wheelchair height to still see the view.   The last section has steep steps and so isn't at all accessible but I felt that the view was fine from the top of those steps.  Strange access issue, I know... but I can't be the only one with both a phobia and serious allergy to nettles... the path is wide enough to get through without getting stung but they aren't exactly cut back and at the beginning of July were a lot taller than me!

12764,23256,Overview,4.0,"The nature reserve is situated just past Brusnwick village approximately 6 miles outside of Newcastle city. It is part of the Northumberland wildlife trust (NWT). There are two hides and a viewing area but these are kept locked and accessible only by joining the NWT, which costs £30 a year plus £10 for a key. There is a car park which is free, and entrance to the reserve is also free. You can reach the reserve from Newcastle city on the no 45 bus from the Haymarket bus station, getting off near Sandy lane which apparently brings you to within 450ft of Sandy lane - the reserve is down a road, one field long.  So as the reserve is split in two - part free and part for NWT members I will keep those two areas in separate paragraphs - firstly the free area.  There is a map in the car park showing routes. There are a couple of routes you can take to look around, one goes down to the lake and is fairly accessible in a wheelchair or mobility scooter, although it is a rough path and bumpy. The easiest path is down to the lake, which is fairly short ( a few hundred ft)., this path loops around to met the other path, but I found that the section after the first bridge is difficult terrain - too hard to navigate on my scooter so I turned back and tried the other path.  The next path was partially through a small amount of woodlands,  on a muddy, uneven path which led to a board walk - again requiring a step up, which I managed to get my scooter up, but Im sure this would be difficult for most in wheelchairs or on scooters.   I managed to get to another bridge and needed assistance on the other side of the bridge where the path goes partially around the lake - I would not recommend this part for anyone in a wheelchair or on a mobility scooter, its just far too rough and uneven. Personally I would only recommend this to wheelchair and scooter users going down to the lake, which is only a very short trip, but its the only area I feel is safely navigated, however after heavy rain, mud could make this unsafe. I would definitely recommend taking someone who can assist in case of getting stuck. It is a nice lake, fairly picturesque, although we saw very little wildlife, the woodlands are nice too. If all you are wanting is to get out for half an hour to an hour and be surrounded by nature then it could be a good option. There are no toilet facilities or cafe.  For the NWT access you need to backtrack up the road until you find the first field on the right, take this path to the end of the woods then to the end of the field, there is a right turn taking down the side of a field into woodlands. The path after the road and along the two fields is rough and bumpy, it drained the power in my scooter rapidly and was very uncomfortable despite being flat, but it was doable - just. Surprisingly this is apparently listed as wheelchair accessible! It was hard work on a scooter and I have no doubt that it would be hard work on a power or manual wheelchair, in muddy weather I would suggest avoiding it, and again I would only attempt it again if I have a strong, able bodied assistant. At the end of these two paths though there is a board walk which provides easy access along to the dipping pond and main bird hide. The hide is locked, but we purchased a key along with our membership to the NWT, it is accessible by a short ramp and is easy to get into for both wheelchairs and scooters. Inside there is plenty of room and they even have some spaces where a wheelchair user can pull their chair up to the viewing areas without having to get onto the benches. There are views into a large bird feeding area on one side and over the reeds and lake on the other side. There are comfortable cushions on the benches too. As usual in hides there are no toilet facilities. There is another hide apparently just off the boardwalk, also locked, which I did not manage to visit this time, but I was told it was along rough track but not far. I will check this out another time.",big waters nature reserve newcastle upon tyne,positive,1,1

Disabled spaces are at the front of the entrance,  but the surface was gravel or cobbles.  You progress through the two buildings via a series of ramps which are too steep for modern standards and in several places they turn corners across a slope.    I'm a reasonably fit user of an energy efficient lightweight wheelchair.  I seldom need assistance in normal conditions - I've even managed stretched of the Royal Mile unaided.  But I needed help several times at New Lanark, which was a problem since I went with my son.  Coming down the ramps was almost as bad - blisters on my thumbs from trying to keep in control.  I wouldn't have been much more confident being pushed by someone inexperienced.   On exiting the building the only way back to the car was up a steep roadway with traffic passing in both directions.    Access to the school house was down a very steep roadway.

Following the signs for the auditorium, it brings you out at Row P which is the only level entry, step free row of seating. There is also another row behind but there are a couple of steps to access this. Looking down there is steep tiered seating, which would necessitate walking up/ down stairs.

When we arrived I was a little daunted as it’s a very old but beautiful building that was formally a bank and had been converted into a restaurant but kept all the features such as the old wood panelling and stained glass windows. The daunting bit was a very steep set of stone stairs leading into the restaurant. We could see no sign for disabled access. One of our party went inside to enquire about disabled access and we were told to “go round the back” and someone would meet us. This was a little confusing as there were a couple of doors we passed but as there was no one there we continued around until we found a gated yard which was clearly a shared access to several buildings including the back entrance to the restaurant. The gate was opened by a staff member who let us in and showed us to the back entrance. If I had been alone, meeting others in the restaurant then I would have been unable to access it and would either have had to ask a passer by to go into the restaurant to ask for help, phone the restaurant from outside to get in or call whoever I was meeting for help, hoping they had got there before me. When we got into the restaurant someone had parked their large mobility scooter in an area that would allow access straight to our table but it simply meant that I had to go around the edge of the restaurant and through the bar area to get to where my party was sitting. Inside there were several tables in an enclosed area in the centre of the room which could have been alittle awkward to negotiate in a wheelchair but we were seated on a table around the outside which  was absolutely fine for access. We had a real issue when we left as there was no staff member available to assist us we had to get out on our own and the gate had a magnet release a couple of meters before the gate itself and we had an issue with the fact that the gate was so heavy that it took us a couple of tries and in the end a passerby helped my mother and I get out of the yard.

The patio had table and chairs, gas BBQ, patio heater and small outdoor fridge, but there was still space to easily move around in my wheelchair.  Access from the patio into the tent was level and step-free. Once inside I was shocked by how spacious it was. There was lots of space to manoeuvre around and it felt bigger than a lot of hotels I've stayed in. It also felt nice to drive across the smooth wooden floors.   The king-size bed was comfortable and was nicely decorated with cushions, blanket and hot water bottles. The bed was lower than a standard bed, so it made wheelchair transfers fairly easy. Space underneath the bed could accommodate a portable hoist if needed.  As there was no electricity in the tent, there were times we struggled especially in the bathroom at night. The small solar light on the roof didn't give off much light so we were almost in complete darkness. This made using the bathroom even with assistance very difficult and a little risky especially as I can't walk, have extremely poor upper body strength and rely on help with everything. I feel the low-key lighting is perhaps not so good for guests with mobility and visual impairments.  There are so many pros to there being no electricity. One being you get to switch off and have no distractions from the internet world, friends etc. However, this could be a problem for disabled guests who require mobility aids/medical equipment and also need to charge them.

For those not on half board, breakfast was only  around 6.50 euros and the three course evening meal 12 euros.  If staying at the hotel, residents also got a 10% discount.  Excellent value all round. Breakfast was  self service but had all that one could require -   Fresh fruit, orange juice, yoghurts meats, cheeses and so on.  There was bacon and sausages available with eggs done to order.    The orange juice and coffees were also very nice.  A meal to set one up for the day. The evening menu was also very extensive, with a lot of choices for starter main and desert courses. I admit to being a fussy eater but during my 11 nights in the restaurant, I managed to vary my main course quite easily. I felt my wife, as a vegetarian,   did not have a lot of choices but she enjoyed what she had.  I mention this to a member of staff late on our holiday and was told if we said what was required, they would do their utmost to supply. On this, we found that staff to be friendly and show interest in their customers.  On the occasions the restaurant was busy, the staff were very efficient in ensuring orders were turned around in a reasonable time.   It was good to watch them in action and they always had a smile for you and seemed genuinely interested in what you had been doing..

Thank you so much Wellcome.  The cafe is still spaced out and the shop is still closed.  There are 2 new temporary exhibitions Tranquillity on Level 0 and Joy on Level 1. The topics feel very timely as we all could do with peace and joy in our lives given the last 18 months we've all had.   Tranquillity is a very peaceful gallery with soothing background music. The exhibition is in 3 parts. The first My Body is a Temple of Gloom section and the third and final section Regarding Forests are dimly lit and the middle section called Balancing Act is brighter. The exhibition is spacious and well designed. We went on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy. It was very easy to social distance. There is seating throughout the gallery, which shows that accessible furniture can be contemporary and creative. There is one exhibition, which is a digital photo gallery and to turn the pages you wave your hand in front of the screen. We felt very mellow and chilled going through the gallery. It was nice to stop and ponder. It's definitely one of my favourites of their temporary exhibitions.   Joy is very visual. The first section depicts people dancing, the second section has a number of smaller and fun exhibits and the third and final section is called Procession of Eighteen. The gallery is again well spaced out and there is plenty of seating.  Neither of the 2 temporary were too busy and the spaced out layout means that it was easy to social distance. It was a very relaxing and stress free visit.  In between the galleries we  went to the cafe on Level 0. It was not too busy when we arrived and tables are spaced out. We both had a veggie lunch box. Really delicious and wonderful combo of textures and flavours. The food is pre-packaged but it is still freshly made and the quality is excellent. It was nice sitting there and catching up after having not seen each other since early 2020. Then we became aware that next to us a table became occupied by a group of about 8-9 people. At that point we decided to cut out visit to the cafe short and we left. I raised it with staff, see staff comments below.  We went back to the cafe later, when it was quiet for cake.

Entry into hotel  was easy enough through an opened wide door (photo 2) and direct  into reception (photo 3) which is very basic. The staff were all friendly and helpful.  However, there was litter everywhere around reception area, no one turned up to clean anywhere, the tiled floor could do with a mopping. and it was same the next day. The lounge and bar is next to reception (photo 4) comfortable enough, but we found chairs were too close together and difficult to get through gaps, but there was a space to leave wheelchair or powerchair   The public disabled toilet is near reception, (photo 5) but floor area needed cleaning up, wide door with pull handle to get in (photo 6) but it’s nice and big, I could spin wheelchair in there and it had grab rails and pull cord. (photo 7). There entrance for lifts was wide, easy enough to move around (photo 8) and three good big lifts (photo 9) but we found using lifts frustrating. You have to put your room key into slot and  pull it out again to then press the floor button you need, but it did not work every time, I was in and out trying door key, reporting it to reception, and having key reset,  very frustrating. When you do arrive at the corridor for rooms it was very nice looking in warm wood colour (photo 10) then most unusual, you pulled your room  door open into corridor area. Entering disabled room (we had disabled room 0512 )  it had a long passage (photo 11) passing toilet, and the disabled room was very attractive, nice deco, and quite large (photo 12) Bed very comfortable and a good nights sleep given. By the entry door was a nice square area to leave wheelchair in,(photo 13) so it was out of the way. The bathroom is a good size although WC pan is rather close to sink, (photo 14) and it’s a good walk in shower (photo 15). What impressed  us as well is the excellent lighting in the room, and two long mirrows at each end of room. However there is no desk to work on you use round table instead, but it had a nice ottoman it base of bed. We both felt this was one of the best disabled rooms we have had over the years. Breakfast is taken in the restaurant (photo 16) with views over city buildings, easy enough to find room for my wheelchair, although I prefer to sit in seats provided, as I am able to stand, and the breakfast selection was ample, and well prepared (photo 17) and the seating is quite comfortable (photo 18). Our final thoughts Very disappointed by the appearance of this hotel and the area it stands in. The hotel floors were dirty and unkept. The lifts were frustrating as the card system did not always work. The disabled bedroom however was excellent, clean, and plenty of room to move about, we felt it was one of the best we have had so far. Either we are both perhaps to fussy, but we felt we would not particularly recommend this hotel, although once inside and moving about it was quite good, but not suitable for power chairs, as certain areas are a bit tight.  But it is very handy for the main railway station, and once work completed on the roadworks, it might be a lot easier to get from hotel to station, and that would be a plus for disabled people.",radisson blu hotel birmingham,negative,0,1

My husband is a full time wheelchair user and we have struggled to find lovely accessible accommodation. Sara's cottage ticks all the boxes!    As we drove down the long driveway with its beautiful wild flowers and saw the cottage we had the inkling we had picked something special. Parking outside the cottage was on level ground, no gravel and a very subtle ramp into the front door.  The accommodation is all on one level, so much thought has gone into everything.  The doors are wide and the rooms are spacious.   Lounge/kitchen was perfect with a kitchen table that was suitable for my husband to roll under perfectly. The kitchen was so well equipped and no expense spared with lovely glassware. We cooked a full roast dinner on the Sunday with ease.  The welcome pack was a lovely touch and the home made scones with cream and jam went down a treat. The conservatory leads from the kitchen and is a lovely place to view the garden and all the beautiful birds that feed off the bird feeders.  The garden was a joy and there was plenty of space to sit outside and have a bbq.  The accessible bedroom with ensuite wet room was perfect for us.  In fact I would say it was far better than many hotels we have stayed in.  The bedroom was spacious with plenty of room either side of the bed and the bed was just the right height for my husband to transfer easily.  The wetroom was brilliant , it was well thought out and practical but didn't lack style and design.  Again the extra little touches were much appreciated. There was an extra grip bathroom handle that could be placed where you wanted.  The sink was a good height, mirrors were well placed, hand held shower as well as overhead shower and good designed hand rails.  The owners live in the house nearby and were available for any questions before our trip and during our stay.  They also  have a wealth of knowledge regarding the local area.  We were very impressed with their website for the cottage, so much detail and also great recommendations for days out and restaurants.

13974,29742,Overview,3.5,"The approach to the old pub lies in beautiful scenic countryside (photo 1) around the delightful ancient small town of Henley in Arden. ( Set your Sat NAV for B95 5 HJ) and it stands alongside the Stratford and Avon canal (photo 2) in the village of Lowsonford. One of the famous buildings here is the Fleur de Lys (photo 3) originally a 17th century public house, by the same name, and was later known for its pies, baked here in the 1950,s. The pub supplied many of the counties fish and chip  shops, before expanding its sales nationwide, and then taken over by Pukka Pies, a firm based in Leicestershire. The Fluer de Lys is named after the job of a Murenger, an officer who had charge of the wall of a town, perhaps originating from the pub in Newport, Gwent. His job was to collect tolls for the repair of town walls, and these taxes were called Mirage. Following our lovely drive to get here, and set alongside the canal, the old 17th century pub looked inviting when we saw it. (photo 3) and the car park is large, on hard core, ( photo 4) so easy for wheelchair use. No actual disabled bays, but all parking is close enough. Easy access to the entrance door over paved slabs (photo 5) all on the level, with a nice shady place to sit under large canopy.  As you enter the pub, (photo 6) it has kept its character with that olde world appearance, and to get in it is all on the level. There is a seating area on the flat as you entered, ideal to place your wheelchair or scooter, i(photo 7) and a powerchair could manage, although in limited areas, but unfortunately, to get to the bar to order there are steps, (photo 8) so your carer would have to do the ordering for you, so a disabled person would not be able to get to the bar area, or even to get to the well signed toilets, as there are steps from now on. The bar has a character with a rustic appearance (photo 9) with plenty of old world wooden beams, you can imagine life here in the past. The large log burning fireplace has plenty of logs stacked ready for use (photo 10) so warming and welcoming on a cold winters day. Exiting the pub, they have endeavoured to try to brighten up the area with a colourful display of a few plabts, (photo 11) and if it is a warm day, suitable to sit outside, a disabled person could manage quite well, with plenty of tables and chairs under cover (photo 12)  but there is another area under a large canopy, by the staked hay bales, but this has large chippings on the floor, and that would be difficult. Beyond this you find a large open grass field with table and chairs alongside the canal, (photo 13) which was very picturesque, and easily enough for wheelchair to be pushed across. Our final thoughts. If the weather is warm enough and you can sit outside, it is worth the visit, the ride through pretty countryside in itself is worth taking just to get here, then it’s an attractive olde world 17th century pub, with an historical story to tell, but the inside of the pub is not at all disabled friendly with lots of steps, and we could not find a way on the flat to reach the toilets. If you can sit outside, it’s very pleasant with lots of shaded canopies if hot, or to protect you from a sudden shower or two. You will get your chair across the well kept grassland for views over the canal, so all in all, for outside use we could recommend taking the afternoon trip and enjoying the olde pub. But because of limited use for disabled we will only offer 2.5 marks. We did this trip as part of our historical canal trip, which we will offer you a full detailed review of the days trip itself in our final review for the whole trip, combining everywhere we visited, which makes for a delightful day out, and one you can manage quite well.",fleur de lys henley in arden,positive,1,1

It also looks great! It is always perfectly clean. The last time I went to the new premises the door was open but this time it was closed, I managed to follow someone else in, otherwise I would have needed help with the door. The access is smooth and step free.   On entering you look ahead to the waiting area, and to your right is the reception desk. There is hand sanitiser but I bring my own as its easier, so I didn't use this and it looked a little high. I went to the far right of the waiting room where there is a space next to the sofa. There is a table in front of the sofa and there's a chunky cube stool next to that, this partially blocked the area I was sitting, but I was able to manoeuvre around it no problem- although staff did offer to move it. My power chair is quite long and has a rear wheel drive. The waiting room is spacious and has beautiful wooden flooring which my manual chair would have glided easily on! The reception desk is low so you can see staff easily for checking in.   Once I was called in, this time I was taken to a different room, the hallway is quite narrow so turning into a room was a delicate manoeuvre! This wouldn't be a problem in a manual wheelchair, but something to be aware of for bigger chairs. I was taken into room 3 which was much smaller than my previous time in room 1. Room 2 and 3 are only divided by a partial wall, there was also no room to bring my chair up side by side to the dental chair. I asked if someone else was in as I have been shielding and I didn't feel comfortable having dental work in the same space as someone else is. I didn't have to say this though as Rhu was walking through and told the girls I could go to room 1, before I was even fully in, which I was relieved about. Rhu is aware that I have been shielding. The staff were friendly and helpful, none of this seemed like an issue to them which is always a relief when things need changed slightly! Room 1 is great for wheelchairs, and I believe room 1 and 4 both have doors so there is no other patients in the same space. In room 1 there is plenty space and is also must easier to get in as you go in a straight line from the waiting room. I can line up my chair easily next to the dental chair.

14215,36569,Access,4.0,"The exhibition is on level 1 and the easiest step free way to get to the exhibition is to arrive from Belvedere Road/ Waterloo Station, rather than from the River Thames entrance. If you are facing the Royal Festival Hall from Belvedere Road walk across the courtyard and make for the far right hand corner of the building, walk round the corner and follow the building round to the main entrance on the left. There are several doors, but I think they are all manual opening. The step free entrance to the exhibition is on your left immediately after the doors. As the exhibition is by timed admission this is the area to wait until your tour starts. The exhibition has 9 different rooms. The door frames from one room to another are very narrow. The website says that only wheelchairs less than 80cm wide can fit and motorised wheelchairs do not work on the uneven surfaces. Pre- booked Southbank Centre manual wheelchair are available for hire. Their website says turn up 15 mins early if you want to borrow one. I used one and although only an occasional wheelchair user and not very good at steering, I found it generally very easy to self steer apart from a few of the doorways (due to the narrowness and angle in relation to the design of the room). There were a couple of places where there were ramps, my friend really struggled to get me up the 1st ramp, so after that when there were ramps I  got out of the wheelchair and walked, but I'm mindful that not everyone will be able to do that. There was also one room where there was uneven surfaces and it was a little difficult to self steer. The exhibition itself is excellent, but in terms of accessibility there's a couple of small things which could have been better designed, there are a couple of rooms where there is video footage and this is with a small, low level TV screen which depending where I was sometimes my view was blocked by other people, so I'd suggest making for where the screens when you go into the room. There are cases with archival documents, costumes, etc and some of them due to the small size of the rooms, the layout and the other people made it a bit difficult for me to view everything easily from my wheelchair. The first room is dark when you enter and the lighting gradually increases. The exhibition has fmGenie wireless communication system designed specifically for use by people with a hearing loss. At the end of the tour there are steps to exit but I was escorted by the tour guide to a step free exit which involved going outside for a minute or two and re-enter the building where the tour started so I could return the wheelchair and collect my crutch.

Unfortunately, these do sometimes get used by the abled-bodied - particularly if it's a comedy night - and especially by lazy or tanked-up men who can't  be bothered to walk a few yards or wait in their own queue to use the loo. Several good wheelchair spaces in the front stalls - or the front row of the circle if preferred or for standing/unreserved gigs. There is a restaurant and a café which serves lovely curries on most comedy evenings or snacks or sharing platters for other shows.

14331,45614,Overview,5.0,"The Palace of the Parliament (otherwise known as 'The People's Palace') was built during the Nicolae Ceaușescu administration, although ironically, Ceaușescu himself never actually got to enjoy the Palace as it was intended due to being overthrown as the leader of Romania in 1989 and then executed, along with his wife, on Christmas Day of that same year. The building itself is a magnificent structure, and can proudly boast to be the second largest administrative building in the world - falling short only to the Pentagon in the USA.   The Palace has an incredibly regal looking balcony from which it was originally intended that Nicolae Ceaușescu would address the Romanian people from - however, a fun trivia fact is that the first person to speak from that balcony was in fact, Michael Jackson, during a tour of Romania! The Palace of the Parliament was also the scene of a very famous Top Gear episode, in which they drove super cars around the basement of the building. Other facts about the building include that it took 20,000 larbourers to complete the building, costing in excess of €3Bn and using only Romanian materials.   In terms of accessibility - the Palace of the Parliament can be accessed from the upper level of the building, with level access and automatic doors to make for smooth entry. Those visiting the Palace do so on an organised tour, and when entering the building from the accessible entrance, you will then meet with your tour party at one of the first points of interest on the tour itself - meaning that you do not miss any of the action. Once inside and on the tour, all aspects of the tour are accessible - with lifts available in order to get from floor to floor.

14529,26182,Overview,2.5,"Having grown up loving the annual Festival in Edinburgh it's been upsetting to see barriers to access...changing that takes time and a lot of effort. I LOVE how much is being done. I went to the box office to collect my tickets and they told me clearly where the access lift was and where to go. They also told me to look out for staff members on the way in case I had any trouble...that reassured me it was ok to ask which is always a worry. Teviot is a large University building with lots of space for various performers.  At the entrance there is a huge sign stating where is accessible with wheelchair symbols at the top...all of it can now be accessed. The access lift on outside of building is a short journey and a member of staff made sure we (my daughter and I) were ok. We then went inside and again it was clear where we were to be. We were incredibly early and there's not masses of space for waiting, the corridors are used for those exiting the previous performance and I hate feeling I'm in the way, through a door to one side it was possible to wait until the event before us had been cleared without feeling awkward...phew. The staff manager came through on her way to another location and asked if myself and a mum with a child in a wheelchair were being looked after, I love when people pay attention to that, it shows they want it all to work. Once we could go into the event the performer actually greeted us as we went in, which is quite unusual in my festival experience and again we sat in the space for chair users. Some of these spaces which are not purpose built are quite small and we had to move to let people slide into the row, there was space to do so but it's worth noting. The performance was larger than 'intimate gigs' probably are, there were 36 others with us, but small enough everyone could see the 'stage' and hear what was happening. We saw Eshaan Akbar:Not for Prophet and he was hilarious. I'm often offended by comedians who poke fun at others from disability to religion and although he did pick on religion is was in terms of what HE'S been through rather than moking someone else. I could relate to what he was talking and joking about and when he mentioned impairments I thought I was going to be upset, only to discover he is deaf in his left ear and uses a hearing aid. He covered topics like immigration, parental relationships, growing up, work, and spoke candidly about the importance of finding ones identity in 2017 when the world appears to be losing it's own. I left still smiling and have already spoken to friends to say not only are the venue and staff great at what they do but that things are improving and that the attitude and atmosphere is changing too. It's taken a long time, but it's gathering pace which is exciting to see. I'd have no worries about returning to Teviot for an event and I'm delighted to see that not all comedians take joy in belittling others, a breath of fresh air on all counts I think!

The park has one of the top best Spa’s, which features 8 pools, with soft gentle relaxing music played to coax that feeling of well being, and as you look around at  what is available you will see that this is truly a first class Spa. For a start off it has two inviting swimming pools, the heated indoor pool is for adults only, with loungers and beach chairs to help you relax in its quiet pleasant surroundings, while the outdoor Heated pool invites all ages to come and enjoy the facilities, which includes a pool bar.  You can also enjoy a spa bath, thermal cabins, award winning treatment rooms, and a modern fitness centre. It is just quite a wonderful experience to see what is available for you, and you will find that they will help and support you all the way, they are encouraging disabled to come and enjoy their facilities, and we really do recommend this as a Spa that all should go and enjoy, words will never be enough praise for Pennyhill Park.  To really see what we mean, then do go to their website where more details and photos can be seen.  OUR REVIEW OF THE SPA AND HEALTH CLUB. The Spa and club has been seperately built away from the main hotel, in a truly delightful setting, and for the disabled we will just point out that if it’s a manual chair you use, then you will need the help of your carer, as it’s uphill on your return to the car park or hotel itself, but don’t miss the chance to see what can be done by people who care for others.  Alongside the main hotel car park by the main entrance, an intriguing village like setting invites you to come and see what it’s all about (photo 1) and the archway calls you on to explore what lies ahead (photo 2). There is a downhill slope ahead (3) that may call for your brakes to be applied to save your chair running away with you, and this will help your carer anyway.  (It would be wonderful if management could ever consider laying down a disabled bay down by the Spa entrance via the path, so that disabled could drive down and thus enjoy this magnificent Health club.)  The entrance to the Spa has a number of steps that may concern you (4) but there is a wide path available that runs over to the left (5) and this will take you along to a pull handle door to get you inside the Spa (6). The passage ahead is very nicely decorated in subdued colours and furnishings. (photo 7) that guides you to the reception desk (8) and the very friendly staff who await to guide and support you. Just explain that you have been encouraged to come and see what is available here, and ask if you may be shown their facilities. It’s all on the level on the ground floor, with plenty of seating (9) with inviting views across to the outdoor pool and back towards the main hotel. You will see a lift awaiting to take you down to the lower level (10) and to the most magnificent heated pool that beautifully lies in marbled stoned flooring, (photo 11) with a bubbling jacuzzi that calls you forward (12). The showers alone are wonderfully tiled (13) and the heated tiled loungers are waiting (14) but I don’t  think my husband will manage them, if he  got down I doubt if he will get up again, so let’s move on before he is daft enough to try. A sauna looks more inviting, and oh my, was it hot in there (photo 15) and what impressed him was the amount of different steam rooms that are available (photos 16 and 17) after which you step out and drop into the plunge pool, and that is cold believe me (18) then a quick wash down (19) before stepping outside to the heated swimming pool, with delightful cane furniture to slip into while enjoying your surroundings (20). He took many, many other photos of this magnificent Spa and health club, but can only show you so much, so please go into their website to see more of what a Club should be like.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS. Absolutely divine, this really touches the heart, but as you have thought, expensive, but surely you feel as we do, you get what you pay for. The whole experience of being kindly shown around their facilities by a very helpful, enthusiastic young lady,  was a pleasure, and a place never to be forgotten.  If you live in the area around Ascot and Windsor, or visiting the hotel on a day out or perhaps staying overnight, then do try this wonderful Health club, it’s a memory you will treasure.",pennyhill park bagshot,negative,0,1

14850,10707,Overview,4.5,"Along with many other museums and galleries in Spain, the Guggenheim offers specially adapted tours for visually impaired people on days when the museum is closed to the public (Mondays).  Earlier this month I went on one of these as a sighted guide with Travel Eyes, a travel organisation which pairs visually impaired and sighted travellers with each other on a huge range of adventurous and cultural holidays. The touch tour at the Guggenheim was part of a 4 day city break and the cost was included in the holiday so I can't say what this would be, but independent travellers are able to book the tour.  We began with a touch tour around the building - or rather around 3D scale models of the building. Guggenheim Bilbao is housed in a visually striking building, and its construction is very unusual.  We were given an introductory talk about its historic and architectural significance accompanied by small scale 3D models, which really gave the visually impaired visitors an understanding of how the building's appearance. Each element of the museum and the external sculptures were represented in small scale, and we were even given samples of the construction materials to handle - sandstone and titanium. Next we went out into the huge atrium, where the steel skeleton can be seen and felt, and our guide showed where the titanium scales lapped into the building from the outside.  All this before we'd even started on the artworks!  Our guide had chosen exhibits for their tactile, visual and auditory aspects.  Visitors with visual impairments were given latex gloves, and we were then guided inside a huge steel coil and  encouraged to shout at the walls, to listen and feel the echo returning. There was a tunnel of maribou feathers which enveloped us as we walked through, and a huge waterfall of digital light, with streams of words constantly falling - the same words were engraved on a third exhibit nearby.  Our guide spoke only Spanish so you would need a good interpreter, but the only real downside was that the tour only lasts 2 hours. Some of our group returned the following day to visit the rest of the gallery.  The welcome we received and the efforts of the Guggenheim team to meet the needs of visually impaired people, were outstanding.  Nothing was too much trouble.

My father is wheelchair bound currently which meant we required help and proper disability access to it. The staff couldn't have been better with us assuring us in advance that they had a ramp into the restaurant (albeit a mobile ramp).  They helped us out of the taxi and had the ramp awaiting. They could not have been more helpful and indeed respectful. In terms of the food - I'd recommend the steal frites (although I'm pretty sure most guys would go for that anyway). Being thin it's easy to over cook the steak but it was both tender, juicy and served with confidence which was most enjoyable. They have a good selection of food, drinks and access to disabled toilet all of which are very important for disabled people.

14876,46528,Overview,1.0,"most of the restaurant is accessible, but the single wheelchair parking bay is the furthest from the door on the edge of the road access to the drive through.  a lot worse than this is the joke of a toilet. to access the toilets you have to pull open a heavy fire door into a vestibule little bigger than a wheelchair, inside here are 5 further doors, open any one of these and you cannot open any others apart from the entrance. to open the ""Accessible"" toilet you need a radar key, but the lock is set so you cannot get the key out of the lock while the door is open, so you have the choice of using the toilet while leaving your keys in the outside of the door where anyone can take them or let themselves into the room with you or begging a member of staff to come and let you in, while you go back to the restaurant and wait, then the vestibule is so small you have to juggle everyone's positions to get into the toilet.  when in the room itself it is tiny, not enough room to turn a wheelchair or have someone to help you unless you leave the toilet door wide open, with no privacy, this lack of room is not improved by the inclusion of obtrusive baby changing facilities, my impression of the toilet was that it was a baby changing room that someone said ""Oh, we can push a small wheelchair in here, why not make it an accessible toilet too?""  all in all i would have been more comfortable sitting in a puddle of urine than going through all that!",kfc york,negative,0,1

14992,17899,Access,4.5,"There are two buildings, the main museum and the Mail Rail, both are in the same road and almost opposite to each other and there is a zebra crossing.  Both buildings are step free and have automatic entrance doors.  The main museum building is accessed by a shallow ramp into a courtyard area where there are tables and chairs and a display of pillar boxes. The main door is automatic and it leads into the shop and café area. Then its straight on to the start of the museum's galleries, which are all on the ground level. At the entrance there are some portable stools. Please be aware that seating inside the galleries is limited. There is a video screen which has benches to sit and watch the films and where there are interactive things to do there are often chairs. However there are no specific seating for people who simply need to rest on their way round, so I'd advise taking a portable stool if you require a seat. We visited on a busy Sunday afternoon and there were a lot of people visiting the galleries. There are lots of things to see and the museum is very interactive, for example you can have your photo taken for you to include it into your own personal stamp, which you can email to yourself, but you have to be at the right angle to do this and it maybe difficult for some disabled people  to participate in this. The lighting in the museum is good overall and display cases and information boards are at varying heights. The Mail Rail is only accessible for people who meet their evacuation procedures requirements, so I was unable to go on it. In the Mail Rail building there is a shop on the ground floor. The lower ground floor is accessible by a platform lift or staircase with hand railings. On the lower ground floor is the mail rail, an exhibition gallery and video footage area. The exhibition gallery related to the Mail Rail and transporting of letters and parcels.  Please be aware that the Travelling Post Office, which is a reconstruction of a railway carriage may start to move. When I visited there were no notices warning of this. I went inside and it was stationary. I then noticed that the floor started to move from side to side and I very nearly lost my balance. Speaking to staff I was informed that the floor is stationary until someone picks up one of the letters and puts it in one of the holds and that then triggers the floor to move. I asked if signs could be put up at both entrances to it, to warn people about the floor's movement and I was told they would arrange this.  At the far end of the exhibition gallery there is an area , which had red and white chevron signs and no other signposting. I think this is because most people will go on Mail Rail and then it will be the first thing they see when they exit the train. I only knew it was there because I had been online and read bout it and asked a member of staff where it was. In this area is the Accessible Rail Mail Show. When I first realised  due to my disability that I would not be allowed on the Mail Rail, I was pleased to read that they have a video show for people who can or don't want to ride the train. This is a very personal view, but I assumed the video was footage of the entire train journey so one could get as close as possible to knowing what it was like riding the train. However the video cuts between footage of the train ride and historical information. I felt this was more geared towards providing additional information to people who had already been on the train rather than for people who couldn't ride the train. I was already feeling disappointed that I was unable to ride the train with my friends, and then felt further excluded by not getting a real sense of what riding the train felt like. The Accessible Rail Mail Show has tip up seats, like in theatres, which means that wheelchair users can also access the space. There are subtitles for the video show and audio is accessed by head phones which are at the back of the chairs. ",the postal museum london,positive,1,0
14993,40405,Overview,2.0,"A lovely natural country lane drive through 2000 acres of open garden views created by Capability Brown, and beautiful scenic views leads you towards the gracious Tudor house of Fawsley  Hall Hotel and Spa, (photo 1). A pleasant gated driveway (photo 2) takes you towards the Hotel, (photo 3). The disabled parking bays are at the rear of the hotel, some distance away from hotels entrance and only two bays available (photo 4), so if it is raining you are going to get very wet. The entrance to hotel (photo 5) is very inviting, but there is a step to get up (photo 6)  and although this is a reasonably low step, we could not manage it without my getting out of the chair, to allow my wife  to pick it up over the step.  Once inside the hotel, we were greeted at reception and escorted into the pleasant courtyard lounge area, and a very comfortable and relaxing area (photo 7)  to enjoy our brandy and coffee afternoon tipple (photo 8).  There is a nice little terrace courtyard to sit in, but rather a high step to get into it, (photo 9) so it was not suitable for a wheelchair, unless you can get out of your chair. The courtyard now leads towards the bar and restaurant, (photo 10) but a number of steps prevented us from using this entrance, so we made our way around on the level to pass the reception area, and down an easy little ramp into the Great Hall ( photo 11). This was quite an attractive room, nicely furnished, but for us it didn’t have the wow factor. (photo 12).  Now, along a level passageway (photo 13) it lead us to the elegant Cedar restaurant, (Photo 14) and we noticed plenty of spaces we would be able to leave our wheelchair in to enjoy evening dinner.  Then you may exit the restaurant via a passageway (photo 15) that leads to the staircase for the bedrooms (photo 16) However, this is a listed building, so no lifts are available throughout the hotel, but we believe there are two bedrooms on the ground floor, but we do not know if these are for disabled use. Not far from reception we found the disabled toilet (photo 17)  and although on the level to reach this area, it was almost impossible to get the Wheelchair into the toilet, so it had to be left outside on corridor. The toilet itself was quite impractical for a disabled person (photo 18) unless you can walk a few steps.  We are afraid that you will have to miss the delightful Bar (photo 19) as there are to many steps to get up and we feel you may already be tired now having faced other steps, I know it wore myself out.  Finally exiting the hotel, you have to get down that step, to return round to the car park (photo 20) on a level path, passing garden areas.  Our final thoughts. This gracious 5* Tudor house hotel is well worth visiting, if you have some mobility, but sadly, this is not a disabled friendly hotel, even though they have done their best, and we cannot recommend this hotel for the disabled.",fawsley hall hotel spa daventry,negative,0,1

I’m not able to cook anything myself so, I don’t need to be able to use the cooker, microwave or sink. However, some visitors may be able to and would struggle due to nothing being height adujustable. There was a worktop near the end of kitchen though was at a great height for my wheelchair. The dining table was also a great height for my wheelchair and plenty of space for 8 people to sit around it. Again the living room was spacious for wheelchair user to drive around, especially with being joint on to the kitchen. I would say the only trouble I had in the living room area was that I kept pulling up the rug that was underneath the coffee table with the wheels of my powerchair. I know it’s to add to the nicely decorated house but, I feel wheelchairs and rugs just don’t go together. Beside the kitchen and living room area there is also a corridor leading to the ground floor bedrooms and toilets, and a staircase leading upstairs.  As a non-mobile wheelchair user I was unable to go upstairs to see what it was like. There was 2 bedrooms though that slept 2 people each and a bathroom shared between the 2 bedrooms. My mum was a little disappointed though that her bedroom upstairs was the only bedroom that didn’t have a wardrobe. She had to share her friends wardrobe, who was in the other bedroom upstairs.  On the ground level of Homelands both bedrooms have a H shaped tracking hoist which covers the whole room. There are 2 single beds in each room, 1 of them is an electric adjustable bed with a profiling mattress. Having an adjustable bed was great due to needing assistance from my helper, the other bed was just a standard bed. My bedroom was the biggest room at Drummochy and I found there was plenty of storage for all my things, especially in the wardrobe. There were also plenty of plugs in the bedroom for my equipment, specifically beside the bed. Beside the window in the room there was a door leading out to the garden. The only problem was we couldn’t figure out how to lock the door, I’m not sure if it was broken or if we just didn’t know what to do. It was a glorious weekend weather wise so it was really warm, at night I found it roasting and couldn’t figure out how to turn down the heating in my bedroom.  Due to it being a sunny weekend we were able to enjoy the beautiful gardens throughout our stay. It was level access out to the garden from the living room, there are double doors to get outside and there are door stoppers available to keep them open. There was a lovely patio areabeside the doors with a small BBQ and a table that seats 8 people. The garden is shared between all of the 4 houses.",homelands trust fife lundin links,positive,1,0

Although there are a few hills within the zoo, they were not bad at all.  We got the public service bus from the bus station at Paphos Harbour upto Coral Bay and then the zoos shuttle bus.  I managed this as I could transfer from my wheelchair, which was stowed in the back of the bus.  Tickets bought and armed with a map, off we went to explore the zoo.  As mentioned, we found the gradients quitter manageable and that the different animal enclosures within easy distance from each other meaning we had viewing stops as we went.  We took in the bird show which appeared to be the same as ones we have seen in other countries, including the UK.  Indeed, the two people doing the show were British.   It was a pity that some of the audience did not adhere to the request to remain seated but no fault of those doing the show.   We enjoyed seeing most of the animals, We especially enjoyed watching the rapport the  ‘keeper’ had with the elephant whilst hosing it down.  We noticed a few bits where one paid an extra 10 euros, such as feeding giraffes.  We were slightly surprised to see small children doing this whilst the ‘zoo person’ sat and reads a book.  Although we are not really ‘Zoo people’ we did enjoy the numerous animals on display and appreciate the layout of the zoo.  Other ‘non animal attractions included Cactus Gardens, a Keepers House, Natural History museum, Art Museum, Traditional Cypriots house.  Lots of attractions to spend a couple of hours at least.

Whilst I realize it may be tied in with demand, but I still find it odd that the three nights we stayed, each was charged at a different rate, with the Wednesday night being £11.50 more expensive than the Friday night.  The only other comment I would make at this point is that when I went to book online, a double wheelchair accessible room was not available yet on phoning the hotel direct, such a room was. Checking in was swift and we were soon into room 206, the same room that we had on a previous stay.   The room was very spacious, with lots of room to get around the bed.   Breakfast was more than adequate, with a varied selection of cereals, fruit, pastries on offer as well as oranges juice and hot drinks. The  downsides  of our stay (and there has to be some) was that we found the bed to be of the soft side and one of the bath towels has seen better days as a hole had appeared where it was very worn.    My main bugbear was the noise by other guests in the corridors and adjacent room at various times of the day and night. Sadly this seems to be the norm in hotels these days or perhaps it is just me getting old and less tollerant.

Waiting room is large and has room to move in.  The Doctors/Nurses come out of consulting rooms and call out the name of their next patient - although could be missed by someone with hearing difficulties, the doctors do usually come into the waiting room and have quick look about if no-one responds to their first call, so I expect they would make sure the person/patient understood.

15793,38096,Overview,3.0,"Our holiday was a Western Mediterranean Cruise on board the fantastic P&O Britannia. Leaving from Southampton we visited Gibraltar, Cartagena, Barcelona, Cadiz, Palma and Lisbon. Before leaving, to make life easier for ourselves we got our luggage uplifted a few days prior to our cruise by the Baggage Handling Company (I would really recommend this service) who transported our baggage to Southampton and the next time we saw it was on board. We done this so all we had to carry was hand luggage as I also got them to take my manual chair just in case it was needed as I didn't know how accessible places would be for my powered chair. The cruise terminal at Southampton had parking directly outside the terminal but we arrived by accessible taxi which dropped us off at the door. Inside was very accessible for wheelchairs with good toilets and ramped access all the way onto the Ship. The staff were very helpful. Onboard the ship was very accessible but my only negative is the lifts. You can at times wait a while. This is more down to people who don't really need them using them all the time with no consideration to others. The accessible cabins were very spacious and the accessible public toilets were also a good size. Overall, all areas onboard were accessible in the wheelchair. One of the pools on deck even had a hoist chair to transfer you in and out of the pool. Staff everywhere onboard were exceptional always very attentive and making sure everything was OK. Getting off at each port was a worry for me, but it needn't have been. There are limited amount of accessible excursions you can book either onboard or before you go, although a cheaper way to do it is by doing your own thing. Other cruises I have been on, if you're not booked on an excursion, you have just got to hope the terminal is  within walking distance of the city centre, or there are accessible taxis you can get as there have never been accessible shuttle buses taking you into the centre. but at each port, apart from the ones where the port is right in the city centre, they laid on accessible shuttle buses to take you to a central drop off and pickup point throughout the day. Once there we generally took a sightseeing tour bus which in each of the cities we visited were accessible and gave you the opportunity to get to know the city and took you to the main attractions at a fraction of the cost of  the cruise excursions. Gibraltar - to be honest I didn't rate Gibraltar too much. I tried looking for an accessible public toilet and found one, only to find that the door opens inward and once in, you can't actually close the door.  Cartagena - a beautiful little place that is quite accessible. The roman theatre museum is a great place to go. The museum itself is accessible then there is the ramp that takes you out to the top of the amphitheater looking down. The first time I've ever had the chance to see such a thing! The city has Lots of places to eat and drink that you can access either by the table service on the pavements or inside. Again everyone was very helpful and friendly. Cadiz - another stunning place worth a visit, probably my favourite place of the trip. Found restaurants and hotels handy for accessible toilets. When we got off the ship in Cadiz we were handed a map of the centre and it had walking routes , one of which was wheelchair accessible.  Palma - lots of interesting places but just wandered around the cathedral area of the city and found accessible hotel for a lovely tapas. Barcelona was fantastic and the bus tour was great. A place I would love to go back to for longer. We also used the underground there as most stations are accessible. A handy tip is the first carriage and last carriage of the train are the accessible carriages so it's best to wait at either end of the platform. I think it is marked on the platform where to wait for wheelchairs. Lisbon was a nice city to visit, again with an accessible tour bus. We just went on the tour then came back after having a coffee. Everything seemed so much more spread out in this city compared to the others.",mv britannia southampton,negative,0,1

16029,9930,Overview,3.0,"Over in the Mallory Court purpose built extension block of orchard House, we found the bedrooms to be cosy and comfortable, with the added blessing of the house having one disabled room, it’s on the first floor, with a purpose built lift available, and the block is set amoung a number of tree top views in glorious grounds, and here stands the state of the arts Evan Spa, which offers you a luxurious Spa break where you will most certainly be spoilt, with its lovely swimming pool, an outdoor  vitality pool, an ideal sauna, hydro pool, and up to date Gym facility. You will even find an outdoor tennis court and other outdoor active sports courts, and grounds that will delight young and old alike, and we found the terrace area to be a real sun trap, even on a cold but sunny late March day.  OUR REVIEW Mallory Court Country House hotel is an absolute delight (photo 1) well maintained, with a wide open frontage that is so inviting. The Orchard House extension is a little way from the main house, but with easy parking, and pleasant walk to reach them entrances, with the bedrooms for this part at the front of the block (photo 2) the disabled room is on the first floor, with a lift available. Round at the rear you will find the entry into the Spa and Gym, (3) which is a reasonable sized Gym, beautifully kept and very clean (4) with all modern equipment (5).  There is plenty of seating available (6) as needed, and a lovely little cafe area (7) which offersclightvrefreshments and drinks.  The pool is very nice, not to big, but warm and cosy as you unwind (photo 8) and there is a delightful terrace garden, with sun loungers and rattan seating and a small heated vitality pool, (9) and it is truly a sun trap, so popular a place to sit and enjoy  after your dip. Alongside the extension are well kept gardens (10) overlooking the tennis court (11).  A walk back towards main Mallory Court hotel takes you along through gardens (12) With the main plants being fragrant roses, (13) and will lead you towards the other extension of Kings court (14) which is used for business meetings, shows and special events, but to the rear there are again garden areas to view (15) but for the lawn there are steps. Mind you, there are well maintained gardens to see (16) the hedges beautifully maintained (17) and later on in the season, the herb garden will be full of herbs they use in the restaurant. (18). This was a truly delightful visit for us.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS Mallory Court is well worth a visit, or a stay, the Orchard House has made it possible for disabled to stay, and experience this delightful hotel. We hope you have read all three parts we have reviewed for you, and would highly recommend this hotel, even if the main house has areas disabled cannot enjoy to the full, but the rest is well rewarding enough.",mallory court country house hotel spa leamington spa,negative,0,1

The main parking area would be very difficult for wheelchair users or those with limited walking mobility, due to being a gravely surface.  We asked parking attendant if disabled parking, he pointed across the road.   We parked outside the ""restaurant"" which had one disabled space we could see, and room for quite a few cars.  Restaurant sounds grander than it is.  Along the path is another shack that was the monkey cafe, at first glance it looks to only have steps in, but has a ramp to the right of that door. Its choices were really basic, and moving space very limited, but it filled a hole! The little monkeys in the small enclosure outside are entertaining whilst having lunch out, (on a nice enough day).   We had a young lad keen to go see the animals, and headed for the entrance. A 4yr old, 1 adult wheelchair user, 2 adults (1 being my privately employed PA). I was really disappointed to find that they didn't offer complimentary 'assistants entry, or at very least significantly reduced. They stated there policy is only those with carers photo id, could be admitted, so with making my displeasure clear I paid the entrance fees.   I have employed PA's for 20+ years, and this is not something I have heard of before. I suggested she meant my CEA card, but no,  ""official like in a nursing home id for the carer to show-with a photo"". I totally understand they need to make money, but unfortunately I am really put off by this, as it doubles the cost for me to have a day out and join my friends. I can't go without an assistant.   The terrain was ok for me, a bit bumpy at times, but manageable with my electric wheelchair. I have poor balance so I chose my paths quite carefully. I was encouraged into puddles by my young friend, as I am assured splashing is fun!  The accessible loo I was in, was near the play park, it was also a baby change area.   The highlight for me was seeing the rescued  bears in the pond, and the monkeys, oh and the meerkats feeding. It was a good day out, not too big a place to go around, and had a play park for kids to have some fun..the £1 a go- karts were my little friends highlight. There was also an indoor play area, which we didn't use as it was a lovely day outside.   I would like to go back, but would need to weigh it up against travel/entrance cost of something else.

16200,4780,Overview,3.0,"This Tudor castle of the 16th century, is a MUST VISIT for disabled people. It stands just 12 miles from Bristol in the village of Thornbury, and is full of historical facts and artefacts and a truly interesting visit, where lunch or afternoon tea adds to its delight. The Tudor castle began construction in 1511 by Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of  Bedford Who lived 1478 until 1521, when sadly, he was beheaded by the order of  King Henry V111.  It is an early example of a Tudor house, now a grade 1 listed  building. The buildings are of Cotswold stone Ashlar, some stacks are of brick, and some roofs  are lead, others tiled. There are compass windows on its south side, most of the  windows though are metal casements, and it still has its original stone built  fireplaces. The beautiful ornate brick chimneys were built in 1514.  The Privy gardens as recorded in the 16th century have kept its name, and lay to the  south and south east of the castle. Noted early visitors to the castle were, Princess Mary who stayed for 18 days in 1525, before she became Queen, and later King Henry V111 and Anne Boleyn who had to spend 10 days here following the outbreak of plague in Bristol, and as you wander around room by room you will note some beautiful artefacts of historical interest. Following the death of Edward Stafford, The castle became crown property, but in 1554 the now Queen, Mary, gave back the castle to Henry Stafford, 1st Baron, but then over the years it fell into disrepair. In 1637 the new owner, a member of the Howard family moved in, and it remained in the Howard family until 1960’s. The castle was renovated in 1824, then in 1849, Henry Howard commissioned Anthony Salvin to restore the castle again, through 1850. In 1960, Sir Algar Howard sells the castle, and by 1966 it becomes  a restaurant and  hotel. Between 1966 and 1986, it was operated as one of the UK,s top restaurants, by Kenneth Bell, with staff including food writer Nigel Slater. According to a local newspaper, the Gazette, an article of April 2011 tells us that (quote) Thornbury castle have gone into administration. (end of quote). It had been owned by the Von Essen hotel group for the past 11 years. It was then bought by Thornbury castle hotel limited in Nov 2011, registered in London, who now manage the hotel, and on our visit in October 2021, is undergoing major renovations in many  parts of the grounds, but the 26 roomed hotel remains open for visitors, and well  worth going to see this quite remarkable castle hotel, which on the ground floor  areas is quite wheelchair friendly.  200 yards from the village of Thornbury, is the gateway into Thornbury castle, (photo 1)  set amounts tall ancient trees.  The 16th century castle buildings are of Cotswold stone Ashlar, some stacks of brick, and some of the roofs are lead, others tiled (photo 2). The castles beautiful ornate brick chimneys were built in 1514. During our visit in 2021 the castle is undergoing restoration work.  The car parking at the moment is on the grass lawn (photo 3) but is easy enough to push wheelchair along. This leads to a long hard path leading to the gateway (photo 4).  You enter the castle through the gateway, on the western side into the inner courtyard. Over to your right in the courtyard is the entrance door to the reception (photo 5), the door being of solid oak. This 26 bedroom hotel remains open for visitors. The reception area is of dark oak panelling and a intricately designed carved desk, (photo 6) giving a feeling of history just oozing out at you. We then entered the Great Hall, and immediately found a place to put the wheelchair (photo 7). We sat in the oak panelled Great Hall for coffee. A very comfortable, elegant room, beautifully furnished, (photo 8) all made by Stephen Edgar, whose workshop is in the castle, and designed with 17th and 18th century decor. While sitting there your eyes are drawn upward (photo 9) to two magnificent  chandeliers (photo 10). Placing my very dry Riesling on the wine table, so as to admire the huge ornate Urn (photo 11) depicting the visit of King Henry V111 and Anne Boleyn in 1535 where they stayed for ten days. There were more urns, so intricately made, absolutely beautiful, it’s hard to describe, and then lunch was served to us in the Great hall (photo 13). (photo 14) Stepping out of the hall, you come to the flagstoned hallway which led to the disabled toilet (photo 15), quite small, spotlessly clean, beautifully tiled, (photo 16) but too small to take wheelchair into. From the Great hall a solid oak door leads you through (photo 17) into another small room where afternoon tea may be served (photo 18). A beautifull huge metal casements window overlooking the gardens (photo 19) invites you to an intimate table for two. The stone built fireplace in the Great hall (photo 20) is actually the original, dating back to 1514. On a cold winters day that would be a delight to sit by, but it now gave us a chance to sit and contemplate our further exploration of the magnificent case, as you will see in (PART TWO, EXPLORING THE CASTLE)  Our final thoughts Our first impression on seeing the castle was disappointing, it just looked cold, bare and uninviting.  Then we stepped inside, and wow, it was so unexpectedly beautiful, and our (PART ONE, THE GREAT HALL) concentrates in a must come to visit and see for yourself, and the ground floor is completely wheelchair friendly.",thornbury castle bristol,negative,0,1

I’m only a part time wheelchair user, so I managed, but I’m always on the lookout , so I double checked, and disappointingly it’s true, no accessible bathroom in the place. One room with some rails ( mine didn’t) and an over the bath seat, ONE, but that’s it. What about the fab new Lodges they’ve just finished? Nope.  The Spa itself is accessible although the changing rooms are a bit of a challenge to negotiate. They let me take my chair into the pool environment which was nice and there are rails and staff to help you in and out of the water.  Couldn’t find the disable parking spaces, had to pay extra for a room that I could move around in my wheelchair ( they did say the standard rooms would be tight for that) and no rails in the bathroom, let alone a walk in shower ( we did have a discussion about that, reception describes all the showers as walk in, but they are not level access.) The staff were in the main absolutely lovely, I felt like a normal human being and that is a great compliment to them, just a shame the organisation as a whole makes it very clear that wheelchair users are not a clientele they want staying in their hotel.

16427,30676,Overview,4.5,"This is one of the top hotels we invite you to go and visit, our highly recommended 5* plus hotel, and we have three parts we have reviewed for you to read, as this is such a wonderful experience, one we will never forget. Part one then will advise you about our absolutely wonderful lunch here in the Hillfields bar lounge. Part two takes you on a trip through the hotels gardens. Part three was for my husband, the highlight, of being shown around the most appealing, wonderful Spa that the hotel is famous for, luxury at its best. Do please read these three parts and see what life is really like for those who can enjoy life to the full.   Driving through rolling Sussex countryside led us to the 123 acres of a most elegant 19th century house, dating back to 1849, offering luxury at its very best. The country house was built by James Hodges, who lived here, while also spending 7 years in Canada while he directed the building of Victoria bridge, near Montreal, before coming home again to his delightful house. He died in 1878, and the house was sold to Louise Schott, who came from a family of merchants, but he himself becoming a banker. On his death, his working partner Louise Floersheim lived here, and in 1903, he extended the house, using Bath Stone, and adding an Orangery. He passed away in 1917, but his wife Julia (nee Baddeley) continued to live here until 1922. Then an engineer Sir Lindsey Byron Peters lived here, he married and had three children, but the family moved out in 1933. In 1935 the new owner Colin Goldsworthy Haywood developed the formal gardens and a delightful terrace. He never married and remained single for the rest of his life, living here for almost 40 years until his death in 1971.  During 1972, the country house opened its doors as a hotel, then in 1981, new owners bought the house, and it was to become known as “Exclusive Hotels and Venues” founded by Giuseppe Pecorelli, until his son Danny Pecorelli took over, and this was the first of his Exclusive Hotel chain, and what a fine job he has done with Pennyhill Park, and his other 5* hotels around the country. Interestingly, during 1999 they built a training pitch here for the England rugby team, who went on to win the Rugby World Cup in 2003. Today it still plays a part in the National teams training facilities at St George’s park. Pennyhill Park itself is only a 10 minute drive from Ascot, and just 20 minutes away from Windsor castle.   This is to some extent a dog friendly hotel, where your canine friends may join you in one of the bedrooms, but do inquire before booking a room, as then your pets may be allowed into the reception and lobby areas. Accessible rooms are available, but must be pre-booked, and from what we have seen of the hotel, we know the rooms will be a delight and disabled friendly. We will never be able to afford an overnight stay here, as a top class hotel deserves its high charges, so our review cannot include disabled rooms, but our experience of reviewing over the decades will give us enough confidence to recommend a stay here as we know you will be well taken care of.  OUR REVIEW  Having just come off the A30 and entering Pennyhill Park through its lovely gateway, it’s just a short but beautiful drive passing many very old trees as you arrive at the arched gateway which looks so appealing (photo 1) then a few more feet and through another arched gateway (photo 2) will get you to the main entrance, where we found the one and only disabled bay (3) right by the entrance. Being pushed over a level tarmac and paved path took us toward a beautiful heavy wooden double push door that awaited us (4) and into the entrance (5) leading to the Hillfield restaurant, and your immediate thoughts are opulence. The doorway ahead led us into the Hillfield bar lounge (6) a delightful area.  We sat in the bar lounge, very comfortable and a most pleasing deco (7) you feel at once you will be pampered here. The counter ahead was being prepared for light snacks, and this is where you order your drinks, beverages and light snacks (8) but of course a waitress will be over long  before you have to trouble yourself. We enjoyed a beautiful light mid day snack (photo 9) with a delicate glass of fresh Merlot, all elegantly laid out in very pleasing surroundings. By our side a doorway awaits where you will be escorted to your table in the Hillfields restaurant, (10) and into the exquisite dining room for your afternoon lunch (photo 11). Here in the opulent restaurant the perfectly prepared buffet style dishes (12) will tempt to tickle your taste buds (13) Along by the reception in a lovely corridor (photo 14) are the toilet facilities, beautifully tiled wall and flooring in a reasonably spacious toilet, toilet with a grab handle available for you, (15) and if you need to, you can get your wheelchair inside and spin around.  As we investigated the hotel, we found one of the delightful lounge areas, to sit with a cocktail perhaps (photo 16) or close by a lovely small cosy sitting area by a welcoming fire, (17)  heat radiating from its fireplace.  Then another beautiful passageway (18) which lead us out to the views over the gardens (19).  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS about part one of our review of Pennyhill Park. If you feel in need of a bit of luxury, this hotel is a must. Throughout it is wheelchair friendly, the deco is delightful, and our one thought was, Opulent. We most highly recommend you visiting for its sheer pleasure, and afternoon lunch will be delightful. ",pennyhill park bagshot,positive,1,1

16431,22287,Access,5.0,"Arriving at the Distillery's visitor centre you have two large glass doors. These can be a wee bit heavy but staff were watchful and quick to lend a hand. Once inside a warm welcome awaits and you can decide whether or not to take one of the tours. Holyrood is unusual in that they are producing both Whisky and Gin on site; hence the choice of tours.   While you wait there's a great shop area to browse and everything was on display in easy to see units - no wondering what was lurking on the upper shelves or behind other things. The two till areas made for easy access too - no fiddly counters to rest your chin on here!  I went on the tour having decided to 'see everything' and was instantly charmed by the amazingly large lift. It's not often I can wheel my powerchair in a lift and then do a complete three hundred and sixty turn. I think my guide thought I had lost the plot when I did three quick rotations!  The lift quickly takes you up to one of the upper levels and the start of the tour.  It was a sharp intake of breath when we entered the first room - all to do with scents and smells - but with an appearance of something of a cross between Hogwart's, a chemistry lab, and Merlin's den! Accessible benches laid out with intriguing glass containers, small bottles, colourful wall charts, and a big black wall of iconic rune like interpretation. You'll have guessed by now that I loved this room.   Moving onward, we moved to the next section, each being cleverly masked from view until you sweep into them. A view down on to the two beautiful shiny copper stills - I'm sure they have a name but that bit escaped me as I pondered on the idea of how few distilleries create this 'gallery' style of view which is so helpful for wheelchair users who otherwise spend a lot of time peering up at stuff.  The enchantment continues as I saw another colourful room explain the amazing flavours that are infused in to the gin making process. I will leave the surprise element of that room for your visit, suffice to say it was vibrant, easy to wheel around and complete with great interpretation walls and panels. I fully intend to bring my visually impaired pal along on a visit - he'll love this magical room. Oh yes, I nearly forgot... in this room sits an amazing work of art - although many will call it the gin still or something similar. It was great to be able to get so close to it.  We meandered on to different levels and were able to revisit my two friendly whisky stills but this time on the same level as the stills. Again very easy to wheel up to and get a sense of the scale. After a pause to admire the stills and the irresistible peering down through the grated floor we moved on.  Going through what looked like a wooden door we were plunged into a dimply lit, aromatic, chamber ... no, not a Harry Potter one but a warehouse style room where casks sat on shelves and upturned barrels formed high level tabes and the atmosphere recreated that of the typical whisky warehouses we see dotted throughout Scotland. The atmosphere, the aroma, the temperature here was so right, I imagined myself being in one fo the many warehouse I have visited on my travels.   From here, where you get a wee dram, we moved into the bar area where you can sit a while, enjoy the view of the Craigs and then the final descent back down to the shop area and time to say good bye.

It would be better on a less busy day, but on Saturdays there are the most extra events and demos going on.  Some individual shops were too small to go into with a wheelchair, but staff would speak to you on the threshold and bring you things. Most stalls have low displays and are easy to access from a wheelchair.

16524,41175,Access,4.0,"From my point of view as a visually impaired person access was pretty good. My pal who uses a powerchair had a different view but still thought it was pretty good. The key to enjoying the visit to the Castle is to do your homework and get a sense of the layout and what there is to see. You can get a map which makes getting around easier. If you are a wheelchair user or have a mobility impairment then it's useful to know that there is a mobility vehicle that can take you from the esplanade up into the Castle.  Once you enter the Castle and Guardroom Square you are on cobbles so these may be a little tricky for some people.  You can pick up an audio guide when you get your ticket which is very helpful in setting the scene.  There is a lot to see so it's useful to leave yourself plenty of time for a visit.   You can visit the Palace where you follow a route through the various rooms. These are brought to life with actors playing period character roles. While you are here head up to the support Gallery to see the Stirling Heads gallery. There is a lift if you cannot manage the stairs. There's also a hand large print guide to the gallery as well.   Another spot to see is the Great Hall with its high vis outside paint and the amazing spacious interior. You can even sit on the 'throne' and get a selfie!  Oh yes, don't forget to explore the Vaults that are under the Palace. See where the lion lived and visit the access room where there are films, objects and activities to help with explaining the Castle. Handily there is an accessible loo adjacent to this room as well.  The castle also has a couple of gift shops as well as a cafe.  ",stirling castle stirling,positive,1,0

All were accessible, and the staff are more than happy to help should you need additional help or information.  I have to point out The Pitman Painters exhibition especially for access as it included iPads to take around the room and find out more information about the paintings contained in the display.  It included extra information not available in the room, fully subtitled audio and video interviews and high-resolution images, so you get closer than anyone else to the paintings.

16556,50076,Overview,3.0,"All the internet photos of hotel excited us enough to want us to visit this hotel, and approaching it looked very nice from the road, (photo 1) but what a disappointment for us, it is now tired looking, still in need of maintenance and a good paint job to try to brighten the place up. The approach towards hotel was not appealing enough for us (photo 2) and although a decent sized car park, (photo 3) the only disabled bays we could see where alongside the disabled chalets, but at least we could park close  enough to hotel entrance (photo 4). This has quite a steep ramp leading into hotel, but my wife who is my carer,  managed to push me up into hotel. The entrance to hotel is very basic, and reception area not at all inspiring (photo 5) Warmly greeted by friendly staff who did all they could to help us. Inside, the lounge had table and chairs, but no sofas to lounge on, and this serves as the bar area as well, (photo 6) big enough to get wheelchair around though. Lounge areas looked acceptable but did not excite us at all, The bar itself functions, (photo 7) but we had a nice cup of coffee. The restaurant again was very basic, nothing inspiring. (Photo 8) with pleasant seating under windows. (9)  If you like us are just visiting, then we need to use the public toilets, and you reach this down a very steep ramp, ( photo 10, the photo is misleading as it does not show how steep the ramp really is )  You cannot get a wheelchair in there, so I had to get up out of my wheelchair to be able to push open the door (11) and get into the toilet area, but it is just an ordinary toilet, with no disabled amenities  available, so no grab rails or pull cord, (12)  and I was concerned as it smelt a bit and I felt it needed cleaning, so in no way was I going to use the toilet. Going outside into corridor again, was of concern, with a very steep ramp to get up to bar area, and as I had gone to toilets on my own, it was a very hard struggle to get up ramp, so if you have to use toilet then have help to get you up inside hotel again. There are terrace areas to enjoy, but disabled could not use these areas, as steps to get up and down (photo 13)  There are disabled chalets available as separate from main hotel (photo 14) a good idea, with parking right outside your chalet, but they badly need redecorating and maintenance on the outside, the present grey colour does nothing to give appeal, it’s just a functional colour they used. there is a step to get up into narrow doorway, so you may need to get out of chair so that carer can help you get inside, then fold the chair up to carry in, but it will be difficult to find space to store it. The room itself is small and very little storage space. The bed is a standard double bed size, (photo 15) With a small open fronted wardrobe and a plain desk, with tea making facilities on it. (Photo 16). And the only other room is a walk in shower room and W.C (17). Our final thoughts. It was disappointing for us, as it looked so nice from the road, we were hoping for more. Restaurant and bar are very basic, uninspiring, simple bar like areas. The public toilets was of concern and care will be needed. The chalets are very small and basic, and we feel we would not be able to use this hotel ourselves with our need to use a wheelchair.  ",the charlecote pheasant hotel stratford upon avon,negative,0,1

After about half an hour of faffing about I queried with the staff whether they might have a wheelchair to get me to the front steps (quite shallow and with banisters, so I could manage them). Staff sourced a wheelchair, but unfortunately it had a flat tyre and they didn't have the required connector. Eventually I was dragged to the stairs in the flat tyred wheelchair by a staff member, bless her!   Despite it having been explained in advance of the booking that I use a three wheeler scooter, staff were arranging a temporary ramp consisting of two narrow runners. Probably ok for a wheelchair but not for a three wheeler! I clambered up the steps with the aid of the banister and staff carried the TravelScoot up and in to the building for me.   In order to get up to the dining room there is a set of steps to negotiate. The height's about 4ft and a temporary ramp had been installed. Unfortunately it was so scarily steep that I needed someone to give me a shove to get me all the way up it, and to act as a human brake when coming back down.  You can drive right up to Cobbleheugh House, which is at the rear of the hotel. Its back door has a couple of shallow steps down from ground level (gates on either side to hold on to).

When I went I was expecting the occasionally tree roots on the pathways, however there were no issues. The main bumps that I encountered were the wire protectors they used throughout the forest for the lights and even then, I have driven over bigger ones that they had (see image below). There are a few steeper gradients that you go up and down, but there are plenty of stewards around to help if you need it. Also, if you are like me and have minimal upper body strength then you may need support going down these gradients because with the issue of these pathway sections being a little steep there are also a few bumps.  There is also a bridge that you go across twice throughout your walk and I needed support on my chest to go down this as it was a couple of inches higher than the pathway.  For the two main shows that were on this year there was a viewing platform for both. Here there was a designated area where people with prams, in wheelchairs and people with other impairments are given priority. The barrier may still be too high for people; however, I think this is needed for safety and most of the light shows are higher up in the forest trees.  There are some areas of the Enchanted Forest that have bark laid down which for me I know the wheels of my powerchair would just spin in so I didn’t even try it. These areas were two light scenes which I could see from the pathway, a food area, where they sold the merchandise and the story telling hut. One of the light shows was interactive. However, the way I see it is that I managed the majority of the light show, more than I thought I would, so missing out on a couple of things I didn’t mind.   I don’t know much about visual impairments however; the pathways are quite dark and there are embankments at the edge of the pathways with a single rope to highlight the edge.

Alternatively there is bus number 17 which stops in Caledonian Road. Both buses stop directly outside the gardens and the stop is called Heathcote Street.

16967,14651,Overview,0.5,"We went to this show/event expecting something similar to the Enchanted Forest (an event we love and have been to many times).  In fact, it was a lot more like an immersive theatre performance than a light display.  Yes, there were some pretty lights, although not anything like the scale of Enchanted Forest or the Edinburgh Botanics lights, and we weren't encouraged to dwell and watch them.  It was difficult to figure out what this event was from the website.  It's in fact a long walk through a forest where actors occassionally jump out at you, pretending to be either Roman soldiers or Scottish Picts.  It was amusing, but I can't see how they can stay in business given the large number of actors.  The acting quality was what you'd expect from good drama students, or as an aside but as a complete show it was lacking somewhat.  The cast also scared young children who were next to us by talking about Picts dismembering and decapitating those who roamed the forest.  A theatre performance has failed if the actors have to reassure children by saying that it's just pretend.  MY ten year old was fine, but I would advise against taking children younger than this.  In terms of accessibility, the organisers have not thought about this in the slightest.  We were directed to 'disabled' parking that was further away down a hill than the normal parking, and then asked to walk up a steep and muddy grassy verge.  The route is extremely long, with little feedback of how far you've walked or how long you still have to go.  Several times we thought we were nearing the end and then found ourselves back in the centre area.  My son is a wheelchair user but choose to use his walker instead, having successfully walked round Enchanted Forest.  I would estimate the route is at least three or four times the distance.  My son did very well but eventually he had to sit on the edge of the frame while we pushed him.  We also missed parts of performances because it took us so long to catch up with our group.  The route is extremely muddy at points, and very steep at points.  We were escorted around the route by a yellow-jacketed member of staff with a torch showing us the muddy puddles and places where the path had a steep and unprotected edge.  At one point a second staff member joined us as we walked down a steep hill approximately 30-45%.  They were there to catch us if we slipped!  At times we were diverted to a different route but ended up walking up muddy verges with tree roots.  This certainly couldn't have been managed by an independent wheelchair user and a powerchair would have struggled with the slopes too. As much as I appreciated their assistance, I would rather we could have spent time out together as a family, rather than our family plus Jonathan the security guard.  There were seats in the middle area that had a burger van and marshmallow stall, although the seats (haybails and logs) were damp and unappealing.  The marshmallows were £2.50 for three mallows, and you weren't able to toast them yourselves!  I think there might have been portaloos, but I wasn't aware of disabled toilet facilities, and certainly not Changing Places facilities.    The paths were lit every couple of metres by a single low level light, and the cast were not lit, so I think people with visual impairments would struggle to access the event too.  Sadly I think this will also be the biggest reason why this event will not be successful, as because it was very difficult to take photos what captured the event to share on social media, unlike other forest light events.  All in all, this has been run by well meaning amateurs with no idea no real idea of how to provide even basic accessibility.  ",legion falkirk,negative,0,1

We had tickets in the stalls, so didn't visit the upper floors of the theatre, but there was a lift providing step free access.  When we arrived the doors of the auditorium hadn't opened. The area outside the stalls had a narrow corridor. There was a bar with the counter at standing height. Round the corner there were 2 seats. In the opposite direction by the bix office there was more space but a standing are only. No other seating was available so I ended up standing, which is difficult with my crutch.  There was a sign saying large bags could not be taken into the auditorium, see photo. I had a small handbag with me so I  was ok but my friend had to put her rucksack in the cloakroom which was upstairs.   On the theatre's website there is an access page and a map of the seating plan, however this does not provide any access information. The stalls were we sat are step free with a slope down to the stage.",cambridge arts theatre cambridge,negative,0,0

16990,45514,Access,2.0,"It was easy enough to get into foyer and reception desk, by using the ramp next to disabled parking bays. (3*). The parking is free, by getting passcode from reception desk.  There is a bar and cafe like eating place, easy enough to get in as on the level. However, the terrace garden has steps from the bar area, unless you go all the way around to the restaurant area, then you can access the terrace area, which is a sun trap, so very nice to use.   The gardens are of no use as steps in use to be able to use  the grounds. The staff are very helpful and willing, and cost of bar food and drinks are typical hotel costs. The coffee, tea and hot chocolate are very good and very hot on the many occasions we have ordered. (4*).   Restaurant very plain and simple, (3*) disappointing, and not appealing,  but food is of high standard and well prepared (4*).  However, to arrive into restaurant, there is a very steep and twisting ramp route to get there with tight corners (2*). The toilets are old and so so, (3*).  There is a swimming pool available (4*).  It is not really a disabled friendly hotel, but the staff are very good and will do what they can to help you, and full marks to Joe the headwaiter who really looks after you. We would recommend this hotel however, despite it being difficult for disabled wheelchair user, and has become one of our favorite hotels to visit for a few hours.",chesford grange kenilworth,negative,0,0

17015,40308,Overview,5.0,"Newborough Forest is absolutely beautiful but it is hit and miss with access. Sometimes possible and sometimes not.  Parking is no problem at all with plenty dedicated blue badge spaces. Very open space and flat.  Right by the car park there is short board walk taking you straight to wonderful views of the Llanddwyn beach and a picnic bench on the board walk. You can’t get on the beach as a wheelchair user which is such a shame but it is certainly nice to see the scenery. If it has been windy then it can be difficult or not possible to cross the boardwalk due to sand blowing over and depositing a thick layer of sand on the board walk (see picture). On a day where sand is minimal, it’s perfectly possible as we have done so on other occasions but couldn’t on this visit. See photos.    The Forrest has an easy nature trail (yellow route). We have done this before in a manual wheelchair but it’s challenging. When we have done it in the Power Chair, it was much easier and manageable so I would say if you want an easy ride, use a Power Chair. It is mainly level and flat but it’s a Forrest so the odd lump and bump. And branches on the floor etc. There are benches around the forest.  Again it can present as an issue if sand has blown over into the route (see photo).  If you are in the area, it’s worth a drive to see if the paths are clear. When they are, it’s a really lovely walk. The drive into the forest is beautiful.  There is an accessible toilet and parking is free with a blue badge (scan the barcode on the back of your blue badge on the way out and the barrier will lift).",newborough forest llanfairpwllgwyngyll,positive,1,1

17040,45495,Overview,3.0,"(I'm reviewing as someone with limited mobility, but not a wheelchair user) I recently attended a gig at shepherd's bush empire, using their access booking process. The process was really straight forward and everyone I dealt with on email and phone was great. I was advised to provide a pip letter a few days in advance of tickets going on sale so that I was already set up on their system. I also completed a form outlining what help I needed. On ticket sales day, everything was straight forward and my booking for me and a companion was confirmed with an email and a letter a few days later with instructions on what too expect on the day. When we arrived at the venue, we parked easily in the road behind the venue (get there a bit early though). After collecting our tickets from box office we were given access via the stage door (avoiding having to stand in the queue) and a member of staff met us to take us to level one in the lift. Non wheel chair users are generally sat on level one as long as you are OK with a couple of steps. The member of staff showed us where the nearest bar was, where the toilets are (again, there are a few stairs to the loos, one which is very high), and then she showed us to our seat which there were no steps too and had a great view! After the gig finished, we just had to wait for the bulk of the crowd to file out, then a member of staff took us back down in the stage door lift. All in all, I was really impressed with the level of care and attention to detail that this venue take. I really got the sense that they just want everyone to enjoy the venue and not be held back by barriers. Will definitely consider attending events there in the future. Whilst I didn't use it, I believe there is a platform on the ground floor for wheel chair users and a disabled toilet on the same floor.",o2 shepherds bush empire london,negative,0,1
