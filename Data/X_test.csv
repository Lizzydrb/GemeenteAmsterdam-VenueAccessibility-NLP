,0
0,plenty of accessible toilets available
1,"Access to the  cottages is via a driveway shared with the Communal centre next door, The Paxton Centre, which is also part of the Homelands Trust-Fife complex.  Both the cottages and the Paxton Centre are beautiful buildings and are fully accessible."
2, The staff were very helpful and friendly .  They helped with akward doors and the bartender even made us a bespoke cocktail .
3,Staff were very helpful!
4,"This is a lovely cafe, beautiful cats and very peaceful atmosphere. Very nice drink and cakes. They do all they can to make sure the cats are happy and comfortable - but unfortunately this takes priority over everything else and this can cause some issues for vulnerable customers.   Lighting level is quite low, and there are lots of items around that could cause issues for people who with visual issues. Again I can understand why this is good for the cats, but it’s not good for us.    It’s all on one level and you can get to most of it using a wheelchair (Part of it is up a step). The gates to stop cats escaping are quite hard to negotiate, some staff will help you (others just turn away and sort coffee cups out but other customers helped us)   Be prepared to move furniture/cat equipment to get around in a wheelchair.  I have no idea if you are meant to - no one has ever offered to help or challenged us so I guess it’s ok :)   Accessible toilet is ok - one of the standard ones for people who can transfer. But we couldn’t get in there as turning circle to get to door was full of cat contraptions.  There is a changing places loo in the Arndale two minutes away fortunately.   Some of the staff are really kind and helpful, others not so much.  We don’t expect the entire world to revolve around us - but there are a few small things they could do to make it more accessible. It’s a shame as it’s such a beautiful idea and it could be a fabulous therapeutic place to chill. "
5,Good number of spaces are provided but its rare to find one free. No enforcement so it is abused.
6,Plenty of available parking.
7,"All toilets on bottom level, close to restaurant and cafe. Very spacious and clean "
8,The road and car park was cobbled and would be difficult for a wheelchair user
9,"Southwark Cathedral historic building with a fascinating history. It's built in the gothic style, think smaller + more intimate version of Westminster Abbey (complement) with very friendly staff. There is stunning architecture, impressive nave with smaller side chapels and beautiful stained glass.  It has links with William Shakespeare and his brother Edmund, who was also an actor, John Harvard, founder of Harvard University. In the Millennium Courtyard there is step free access and the Cathedral's café. This review is just for its self service café."
10,Mostly step free to all the main building. Good signage. The outdoor chairs did not seem very accessible but this could be easily fixed.
11,I spoke to a few staff and all of them were nice and present. I accidentally spilled my drink but the member of staff said 'no problem' and went and got me a new drink. Wonderful staff. 
12,We parked on the Manchester United car parking which is a prebookable place through online and your literally 100m away from the stadium it is £12 for the day and is open three hours before kick off.
13,There were a lot of signs for lifts and hearing aids as well as braille.
14,"My experience was awful and so bad I wrote to them but they haven't bothered replying...  The information on their website suggests a certain degree of accessibility which just isn't there.    Access to the bear house involved crossing the grass.  When we reached the house, the entrance had a large lip which my carer had to tip me up and over.  This wouldn’t have been an option in my electric wheelchair.    Then we headed to the dolls house section.  The ramp was not flush to the ground and at the other end was not flush to the floor inside, again requiring my carer to lift and tip the wheelchair.  Once in, not all houses are visible because they are too high.  The wheelchair map wasn't given to us and when we found out about it, staff made a song and dance about getting it for us.  Access to the cafe was via the toilets and two heavy doors, one of which opened onto a slope making access exceptionally difficult.  I believe access to the hall itself was impossible."
15,"Basically, everything and everywhere seemed spacious (except the lifts!), displays weren't too cluttered and friendly staff."
16,Step free access to ground floor shop and café. The café has free standing tables and chairs. The shop and café is more spacious than it first looks from the front as it extends quite a way to the back. 
17,It was the best thing about the room!
18,"Extremely welcoming , nothing too much trouble . "
19,There is an accessible loo but there is only one door to go through for everyone so might be difficult with a chair especially  in busy times as it’s located just outside the restaurant.  I left mine just outside and used my stick to go in. I had to leave a label on the red cord as it wasn’t long enough. It was ‘cleanish’. 
20,"We booked a table in advance, enjoyed  our  afternoon tea,(which was served at the table) price  is very reasonable. There is a Café you can purchase various food and reasonably priced too.  The Staff are all volunteers and were very helpful, making sure we found our table and topping up our tea pots.  Whilst enjoying our afternoon tea, we were able to listen to the music being played on the Wurlitzer and watching couples dancing, putting our Guest in the mod to hit the dance floor. This was a great experience for one couple who had not danced in years, a great experience for someone living with dementia, a great talking point afterwards. Staff did not hurry us and we were able to come back to our table after   having   a look around the Museum and Fairground, ( there is a small charge for Museum but Carers go Free)"
21,Clearly marked accessible loo but access via 2 doors needed assistance and reverse exit.
22,"Really good store with lots of accessible parking bays, ramped access and close to the Northlink Ferry terminal."
23,"The access is level and they will provide you with a map of the site showing the routes. The visitor centre is fully accessible with everything at accessible heights and at the end there is a long window where you can see an amazing view across Whitby harbour. There is a lift up into the site itself and some ramps placed strategically around with grassy areas that would be OK in a powerchair on a dry day. Also worth checking out is the lovely YHA garden (if you can get throught the narrow garden gate - our power chair user managed it but it was tight! There is an accessible cafe with seating inside and outside (picnic style tables) and nice views across to Whitby town. Does drinks, cakes and light savoury snacks e.g. sharing deli platters, soup and a roll etc"
24,"Stepfree access from the street, very slight incline going into the restaurant. Slightly tight at points, room for a wheelchair but someone struggle to pass you by."
25,Staff were friendly. 
26,"There is local parking for this parade of shops, but there are no assigned disabled bays. Good luck!"
27,There are ramps throughout the ground floor of this 800 year old building making it completely accessible for a wheelchair user.  There are plenty of pews where you can stop to take a rest.
28,There was soon spaces but could do with more
29,Always friendly and delighted to see new and regular customers.
30,"Helpful staff, but totally inaccessible toilets"
31,The staff at the Sheraton contribute much toward the experience. They were so helpful and friendly!
32,"The staff are pleasant, but often very young, and a little inexperienced. "
33,"Now home to the Real Junk Food Project cafe currently being re-furbished. Access to cafe is good and staff helpful. ""Pay as you like"" cafe using supermarket food that would otherwise go to waste.  Didn't access toilets this visit.  Disabled parking at nearby Lidl if you make a purchase in store."
34,"It's situated on the high street, which has a couple of disabled parking bays, one of which is very close to the front door. It can get quite busy at times, so parking close can occasionally be difficult. There is a large car park with more disabled bays a short walk from the cafe, but it's down a hill that some users may find challenging."
35,Great show and very helpful staff although the wheelchair spot I was given was right off to the left hand side of the theatre which rather spoiled my view - thankfully I was able to angle my chair slightly which helped but my companion who was in one of their seats could not do this.
36,Disabled toilets appeared in both stands and were very modern and well equipped for wheelchair users. They were well organised to provide a lot of space and make it easy to transfer if that is what you require. They were undeniably the best disabled toilets I have seen at a football ground in my time of following the Blades in the lower leagues. The only issue was the automatic light turned off on several occasions and you have to keep moving to keep the lights on! 
37,Very shocked with their fire safety policy and insistence that we had to be upstairs. Miles from the stage. No choice of seating area.
38,The outlet shopping centre has good level entry and excellent flooring throughout. Some ramps which are quite steep.
39,"Brooks is a forty-six-bedroom hotel created out of an 1840 gothic stone building. With a great Scottish flavour, it has a character all of its own. With a large accessible ground floor bedroom and adjoining bunk room it offers something different."
40,"The museum itself was small with some tight corners for standard manual wheelchair.   Non-standard would find it challenging.  Good care taken when boarding boats - wheelchair and passsenger lifted onto boat.   Gentleman with electric buggy damaged buggy negotiating route to boarding.  Lent manual wheelchair for trip to Island and electric buggy repaired by return.    On island busses had lifts and wheelchair space, did not see used for either of the wheelchair passengers who had some mobility.  Terrain challenging for pushing chair in parts of prison."
41,"This is a unique self catering accommodation that is flexible enough to sleep from two people to sixteen. We originally booked a two bed unit while visiting the Naidex exhibition in Birmingham. When we told our friends they wanted to come too so we rang Moira and changed our booking accommodate four people. This was done with ease and Moira is an excellent hostess, always on hand but never in your face. We all loved the accommodation and it's the first time I can remember having a self catering holiday where my disability was never an issue. Everything you could think of is there plus easy step free access and in our room a lovely bubbly bath, I haven't been able to take a bath for over twenty years so that was a real bonus. There was lots to do within easy reach and even though the weather could have been better we found plenty to fill our days. We had a great holiday and I'd highly recommend it."
42,"The entrance is usually propped open, and has a small ramp up. Once inside, the smooth floors are easy to move across, and shelves and display units are spaced apart allowing easy movement between them. There is no clutter on the floor, and the till is low enough to be accessed easily from a wheelchair."
43,Easy to get around with our buggy friendly animals can't wait to come back to see it aluminized in September!
44,The ground floor apartment comes with a private parking space with direct access to the apartment. Local transport - particularly buses - were fully accessible with ramps and two wheelchair spaces per bus. 
45,"The staff were very helpful throughout our stay. We changed rooms whilst we were there and they sorted everything out for us and moved out luggage. The dinning staff were also really nice we had brakefast there every morning and staff were helpful in getting my food, helping with getting things back to the table and seating us out of the way so I didnt have to worry about being banged while people walked past."
46,"The accessible toilet was also great and much better than I expected for a listed building. It was larger with a good amount of space to move around. It had the standard accessible features - grab rails, emergency cord and it was RADAR locked. There were also personal touches including toiletries like deodorant, hand cream and female sanitary products placed inside a box. I took half a star off because the toilet is located on the other side of the accessible area, which can't be helped because of how old the building etc."
47,Great fish and chip family friendly restaurant near the waterfront. Also sells burgers and pizzas.
48,Very helpful
49,The bathroom in the bedroom is excellent - raised toilet seat with grab rails.  Shower is great with both fold down seat and shower stool. Even has the hairdryer at wheelchair level. Toilets in reception are disabled friendly. Toilets at pool area are disabled friendly with an accessible shower.
50,"With a wheelchair accessible vehicle to pick you up and drop you off, you can see  as much as you want! Every effort has been made to make the zoo as accessible as possible and staff will gladly help you out. Tigers, lions, penguins and pandas plus many more. Restaurants and picnic areas are available and there are accessible toilets throughout.  Hills can be steep though so beware!"
51,"Entry to the aquarium is 12.90 Euros with wheelchair users charged at the 60+ years at 10.90 Euros.  Seemingly there is an extra charge to see a film.  Perhaps we ought to have done that to eek out our visit.   As per the norm with such places, the exit ended up in a large gift shop, from which we found it hard to find the actual exit.    Once exited from the gift shop, one ends up beside a very large Cafeteria/Restaurant. Due to the size of it and choice off food, I imagine that this is  used for other functions. Overall we enjoyed our visit to this attraction that we found to be well laid out and clean.  Staff were doing information talks but we seemed to always get there when the were ending.  An interesting attraction which will appeal to all ages."
52,The venues for disabled parking is just adjucent to the main short corridor to the train station and is very accessible. Public transport appears to support more of those who use taxis becuase the drop off point is also near to the corridor. The bus stop is not to far away as well.
53,"Being a long-time bird watcher, totally wheelchair-bound, I have visited  many bird-watching sites both in the UK and abroad.  Of all the venues I have visited I consider Sculthorpe Hawk & Owl Trust Nature Reserve the best of the best for access because practically everywhere is boardwalk traversing woodland and marshland. Furthermore slopes into the hides are never more than a one in 20 climb and at this time a tower hide is under construction which is four metres above ground that the author his climbed via three slopes up to the hide which gives a wonderful view over marshland where marsh harriers breed.   The staff at the reserve have taken into account my suggested improvements via the charity - see www.birdingforall.com - And continue to take into account my suggestions as explained  in the link below. For more detail see: http://www.birdingforall.com/index.php?page=sculthorpe-moor-hawk-owl-trust.   Also checkout the Sculthorpe website for more info. http://hawkandowl.org"
54,There is no parking on museum grounds due to it being a historical site. However there is public parking within walking distance of the museum and if offers good value if booked online before hand. There is also blue badge public parking available down the street on Merrion square west.
55,"Haltenprice leisure centre has a 25m swimming pool which provides a wide range of activities and session to suit all ages and abilities.  The centre offers a wide range of facilities such as; fitness suite, clubs, squash, exercise classes, parties, cafe and a library.  "
56,They are all very helpful and willing to assist you with anything that you need.
57,Large with vertical and horizontal grab rails. 
58,"Entrance is through wide double doors with step-free access. The doors are not automatic, but if you require assistance with these I did notice a buzzer clearly labelled with Dovecot outside the door. Once inside you are in the shop which is spacious and incredibly interesting. To your right is the main exhibition room which itself is massive. The current exhibition features jewellery and has a low stand with bangles which guests can try on. To the left of the shop is the cafe which is welcoming, cosy and has moveable chairs. The entire venue is bright and light there is a lift to all floors. Upstairs is the viewing balcony for the weaving studio, and I had this all to myself today! Absolutely serene and I can't stress how spacious this area is. Could have stayed for ages. Interpretation panels were all at a good height and there were benches all around the balcony if you needed a rest."
59,Even during busy sales shopping I had a very comfortable experience and looking forward to going back
60,"There is Blue Badge parking on the ground floor of the multi-storey car park on the Leisure Complex site, and also a few spaces outside Cambridge Junction, across the piazza from the cinema entrance. These are all operated by NCP, and there are no concessions for Blue Badge users. Accessible buses from the city centre and railway station stop near the cinema."
61,"Although there is a level entry into the hotel and up to reception desk, from then on its has steps everywhere, and being a listed building, there are no lifts. This prevented us from seeing everywhere we wished, and COVID restrictions were also in place."
62,Never disappoints. Only loses a point for the heavy door to the loos.
63,Access is through 2 automatic doors and to get up to the 2nd floor you have to use a lift.
64,There are bus stops outside the practice however if you are coming from Spondon the buses do not go past the practice you have to walk or get off at Nottingham Road and walk to get the black cat bus on Chad Lane end (near the shops).   There is a car park but I've never used it.
65,The staff were friendly and helpful. They seated us at a suitable table away from drafts and advisied us on what was best to order.
66,Visited Rip It Up at NHM. Was able to park at disabled spot at Tower Restaurant but disabled parking is s limited. There is a walk to the  main entrance where there is a lift. I do not use a wheelchair but a walking stick. All the entrances appear to be wheelchair accessible. A good idea are fold up chairs which you can carry or use as a walking assistant so you can sit down anywhere when you feel tired. This made the exhibit easy to navigate plus there was some seating. Very good disabled toilets with very unusually sanitary dispensers. There are lifts but they are very busy
67,"Although we hadn't acquired a stadium wheelchair space, we were able to find suitable parking in close proximity to the stadium thanks to the stadium's city centre location. "
68,There is on street parking outside but no wide disabled bays. The nearest bus station is about 10 minutes walk away. 
69,"The nearest parking facilities are available in the car park just behind Pret A Manger, it is wheelchair compatible as it has a ramp leading up to the car park, as well as a lift. "
70,"There is a disabled toilet, with a ramp to it - the only slight extra consideration is there are 2 swing doors to negotiate to access the bathroom - so a wheelchair user on their own would struggle with this"
71,"Smaller venue so less event staff, helpful but a bit more harassed than at the other locations."
72,There is no parking outside the cafe as it is in a pedestrianised shopping area but there are multiple disabled parking areas around Truro's main shopping area. There is also the multi-storey behind M & S so you have to come through the store and out onto Lemon Quay and Caffe Nero is just opposite.  The Bus Station is just a few steps away as well. 
73,"The loo itself is good - well equipped etc. - though a little spartan in the decor department. It has a sliding door. It's handy for the accessible seats in the auditorium.  However, not sure if this loo is available during the day or when there isn't a performance eg for visitors to the cafe or restaurant.  There's no signage from the foyer."
74,"The Richmond Street Deli is a lovely little coffee shop in the Rosemount Area of Aberdeen. The deli makes delicious homemade soup, excellent coffee and very good sandwiches, wraps and breakfasts. The most unique feature about the deli, is that its has a free book swap. Customers can bring in books they have read and swap them for ones they haven't. The deli has floor to ceiling book shelves crammed full of fiction and non-fiction books to cater for any literary taste. The book swap works out significantly cheaper than buying books or getting library fines! It appears that the deli is wheelchair accessible (although I have not been there in my own wheelchair). The doors appear wide and there is a disabled toilet. The deli is on the ground floor and is cosy yet spacious. There is also a disabled parking space directly opposite the deli."
75,Plenty of parking along the sea front.  Bus from ferry terminal to the town of Millport
76,"Pleasant enough, willing and supporting."
77,"There are disabled parking bays in all the venues, with easy enough access to the places of interest, the only slight concern is the low small step up into the entrance for FAWSLEY HALL HOTEL, but we coped very easily with that."
78,"We went along for lunch and pool. They have a special deal on weekdays- pizza for half price, which meant you could get a cheap but tasty lunch. They provide pool cues and all the equipment, so you don't have to bring your own, but you do need to put down a £20 deposit to play, and if you don't pay attention to the time, you can spend much more than you thought, as there is no time-keeping. You pay afterwards for the time you spent."
79,Close by to some public transport; particularly buses. Not too far from Central Station.
80,Very helpful
81,"Muddy Boots farm shop and cafe is an ideal venue for a day out in the countryside.  The cafe has scrumptious home baking as well as a good range of tasty food.  The farm shop stocks local, fresh produce and a few gifty things too. Friendly and helpful staff."
82,Clean toilet with a decent hand dryer
83,Again excellent toilets with grab handles and plenty big enough for a carer and also for me to turn around in there.Very clean also.
84,"Ars en Re is one of the small towns on the island of Ile de Re. It's known for its church which has a distinctive black and white spire, so sailors can recognise where they are. The church which is open all day for visitors is located on a central square which has a handful of cafes and houses. A 5 minute walk from the main town square is a small port and in the opposite direction about 10 minutes away is a beach area."
85,Not enough of them
86,Several parking areas close to the Fort with plenty of disabled spaces.
87,"There is a ramp on entry to the restaurant this has a slight couple of lips in so you may get stuck if you've not got foresight of these, the door also opens towards you, it may be difficult for you to get in if you are alone. Once inside we were situated at the long table by the door and I slotted in just fine onto the end of the table. There are tables further in if you have a smaller party size that you'll be able to be seated at.   Menus were also a good size with easy to read font."
88,"The good sized accessible toilet was next to the disabled area, literally fifteen feet away from us. It required a Radar key, preventing it from being abused, and was also being policed by the dedicated staff near to us."
89,A carpark with disabled parking is located close to the Guildhall.  The local bus station on Foyle Street is a few minutes walk from the Guildhall.  Local buses also stop very close to the building.
90,Staff were there to greet customers as they walked into the shop. Staff were polite and friendly and were easily recognisable if we needed to ask for help. 
91,Accessible toilet is available  There is a hoist and changing bed available in the adapted changing rooms.
92,"I traveled in a taxi to this event, you can be dropped off immediately outside Queen Street, High Street and Argyle Street train stations are within walking distance.  There are regular buses on the Trongate and Glassford Street which are nearby the venue. There is an NCP car park on Ingram Street and Albion Street. "
93,Very friendly - can't fault them!
94,"For a historical site it was amazingly accessible.  Yes the ramp from the carpark to the site was a bit steep and the ground a bit uneven in places, but achievable.  I did however have to get my dad to go pay & pick up the recordings as the hotel had two steps to get in and no bell for attention."
95,"There are grab rails in one of three cubicles, with very narrow entrances to the toilet on both floors making it very difficult to fit a Wheelchair through. There would be no room for a carer to assist in the cubicles."
96,No problems at all
97,"There are several methods of entering the garden centre: - Main entrance, this is level access so is perfectly fine for anybody in a wheelchair, walking frame etc. -Front plant display, there is a display of plants to purchase directly off of the car park. There are several aisles to chose from but all but one have steps several inches high which there is no way I could negotiate even with the help of my PA. There is one single aisle with a ramp leading up to it which I could easily roll up but part way up there is a large pot hole. The owners have tried to make an effort to fill this by adding a block of wood which sadly does very little to make it possible to negotiate with a wheelchair. -Cafe, there is a wooden ramp leading into the cafe which is very easily accessible. From this entrance you have free access to the whole cafe and the lower level of the gift shop, to get to the upper level of the gift shop and the garden centre there is a very steep ramp. There is no way I would be able to push myself up this ramp and to be honest it was a struggle with my PA and I both pushing. Once in the garden centre there were places where there was a single step or a gap into a greenhouse or from one area to another. The staff had obviously realised that these were problematic to someone in a wheelchair so had tried to “bodge” a ramp from whatever was lying around which were inappropriate so had broken and not been replaced or were not big enough so had fallen into the gap they were trying to cover. In the plant area occasionally there was an obstacle in the way such as a trolley waiting to be unloaded or a big plant or tree, which meant I couldn’t get passed so had to turn around and find another route. The gift shop was very tight to get around and I was constantly very conscious of all the beautiful but very delicate items for sale there. As previously mentioned the gift shop is on two levels with a very steep ramp between the two. The cafe is very tight in places but there are enough tables on the periphery that were accessible to someone in a wheelchair and the staff were exceptionally helpful to ensure we were seated and comfortable. There is also a beautiful outside seating area with children’s play area for the cafe which can be accessed by a wooden ramp. I would not recommend this to somebody with a big powerchair or someone who has a big mobility scooter and cannot get out to walk around certain areas."
98,Disable access is very good.  Pendragon cater for those with profound disabilities.  The centre was easy to find using a sat nav but not many signs on the actual industrial estate.
99,"Good selection of public buses, 2, 3, 5, 8, 29, 30, 33, 49 but on street parking would be tricky. "
100,"A fab day out - huge thought has gone into wheelchair accessibility, including having a Changing Places toilet."
101,Very rude and unhelpful. Particularly the woman who is really ignorant
102,Very easy to find. I had left my mobility scooter outside and had walked in so I couldn't really tell how easy it would be to manouevre but there seemed to be enough space and the toilet was spotlessly clean.
103,A 24-hour convenience store with level access and an accessible toilet - great place to stop for a break!
104,"This cafe is a relatively new venture.  The building is only temporary and the owners have been unable to develop the car park due to planning constraints. The building is perched on the edge of the cliff overlooking the Firth of Forth with a great view of Bass Rock and Fife on a clear day.  Unfortunately, the rock was shrouded in mist appearing briefly before disappearing again. The popularity of the café was evident by the number of occupied tables. We were lucky, as just before we came in, a table became vacant.  As our party included 3 wheelchairs, and 2 of which being quite large  it was felt that the space was just too limited. Carers need to check out the table to ensure everybody is seated comfortably alongside whoever is assisting them.   This café is not suitable for large wheelchairs.  The menu is only available on a board behind the counter so mobiles were taken out to take photographs and pass around!  Lunch was ordered at the counter and arrived quickly."
105,"Visited the local Hospital for an appointment today and used the disabled loo, where I was, yet again, dismayed to see the red cord was cut off at approximately waist height. Surely a hospital should understand this and get it right?"
106,"Despite not having access to the upstairs attic, there are still many rooms accessible for wheelchair users which is great to get a taste of Glasgow nightlife."
107,"Top marks go to Murrayfield. There was more than one accessible loo and those I used were fine with ample space, spotlessly clean and everything I needed. Since my visit, and on a subsequent visit, I found Murrayfield had installed a Changing Places Toilet - in a word excellent!"
108,Automatic doors and lift to the foyer
109,"Visited Bovington Tank Museum and saw lots and lots of tanks surpisingly. Throughout wheelchair access was great and I could wheel myself easily amongst the displays.  Information boards be at a perfect height and angle for me to read and because I was in charge I could do so at my own speed.  There were areas I didn't venture and a large, steep ramp between floors, which was avoided.  No problems in either the cafe or the shop.  There are disabled toilets but don't recall checking them out, sorry.  Also didn't check out their outdoor display this time.  Glad  I wasn't a tank operative generally they seemed crampe, smelly and hot inside.  I hasten to add I did not try one!! although you could."
110,City Art Centre has good overall accessibilty for wheelchairs - large open spaces and huge lifts.
111,Very well thought out for those with mobility and sight impairments.  (Free) very knowledgable tour guide available  
112,Cheerful and communicative. 
113,All on the flat. Totally accessible 
114,"Generally staff in M&S tend to be good, but seem very busy in cafe, lack of general Disabilty awareness"
115,The staff are friendly and very helpful.
116,"The staff were fine, service was fairly quick although the person I was with ordered beans with their meal and were given peas instead!"
117,The Palace is situated at the bottom of the Royal Mile and across from the Scottish Parliament. Bus tours usually pass here and so does the number 35. There is a car park but it can get busy. There are also a few accessible parking bays on Horse Wynd.
118,"Large spacious store, big lifts, helpful staff, accessible loo on every floor."
119,There weren't many staff in evidence but one I met were helpful.
120,"Main door is plenty wide enough with seating on the ground level, they have additional seating downstairs (not checked) "
121,Had great day with friends & well priced.
122,"Staff all seemed pretty helpful. There were plenty of people to check tickets on entry, your covid test result and show you where to go. They were operating a order from seat policy for bar drinks which worked well - I hope that continues."
123,"Very tight, only one for the small cafe. Did get my large power chair in but no room to move."
124,Disabled access is very good. Signs are large and almost every door has automatic buttons. The building is all on one level and has lots of facilities available. There are however no automatic doors to the charging room and once in the changing rooms there could be a problem pushing eg a wheelchair as there are benches in the way.
125,"No lift as it wasn't required - everything is on one level. The tunnel was good but may have been difficult to get a wheelchair user around. It is part conveyor and part normal floor, but rather narrow. It was difficult for te person I was with, who has an unsteady gait, to walk around easily. The rest of the aquarium was spacious, and easy to manoever around. Some of the ramps,were rather steep so this may prove difficult for some wheelchair users."
126,"A slight ramp to get in, otherwise level access throughout and very spacious.  Many safety features including emergency alarm, emergency lighting, torches etc. See their website for more details. "
127,"Throughout the park there are no steps on the tarmac pathway or leading to either tea rooms, however there are a few slopes on this pathway however it is very open and areas to sit down to take in the views. Both tea rooms are wheelchair accessed and therefore staff are happy to cater for the needs whether this is carrying the trays outside or bringing extra chairs out to the benches outside."
128,Extremely pleasant. 
129,clean toilets 
130,"good size rooms, would benefit from being renovated to remove obstacles. great staff"
131,There are always staff available to help. 
132,"Great! You can enter on the ground floor from New Bridge Street West, or you can enter on the first floor from the side of the building (Princess Square entrance). On the ground floor there is a help point with friendly and helpful staff. There are two lifts that lead up to the other levels of the library."
133,I came in to the salon first to book an appointment and was given a tour of the salon to make sure I was comfortable with the access. Great experience and look forward to going back.
134,"On street disabled parking in the Crescent is free to blue-badge holders, as are most of the Pay and Display car parks in Buxton.  If you are lucky you can park on the street behind the restaurant (by the Old Courthouse shops)for a shorter distance to travel.  Both parking options involve going over uneven terrain to get into the restaurant."
135,All staff attentive.
136,The Dairy is one of 3 cottages owned by Diane and Andrew Howarth who are always on hand to help you and nothing is too much trouble. Thoroughly recommended.
137,"There are disabled toilet facilities in the library but these were allocated on the first floor of the building where there is a function room. However, there is sufficient lift access to the disabled toilet upstairs, and the area upstairs is very spacious for wheelchair access. The disabled toilet had a large door which allowed easy wheelchair access, and space within the toilet for maneuvering a wheelchair. There was a grab rail which is beneficial in aiding support when transferring on and off the toilet."
138,Disabled loo
139,"The space inside is all on one level and was very open and accessible. Lots of different inclusive equipment  and rooms available. Staff were friendly, welcoming and very helpful. The only reason we are not giving full 5 stars is because it doesn't have a changing places toilet."
140,Plenty of room to manouevre. Very clean.
141,Flat entrance then everything on one level.
142,"Disabled toilet was very small, barley enough room for a wheelchair never mind space for my carer, extremely difficult to manouever chair to get in or out of the toilet."
143,Staff always helpful here
144,This small toilet was a godsend in a very remote part of the Isle of Mull. We went to the end of a road where the Ulva ferry left from on the off chance there was a toilet there. We found this accessible toilet on its own. It may not have been pristine but was very adequate for my needs. I felt it was worth reviewing as we fell on it accidentally in this remote area.
145,You can use public transport and there is off street parking for blue badge holders nearby.
146,"Extremely well stocked house, in an incredible location. Weather was incredible, but even if this had not been the case we would have had a fantastic time with all the board games and hot tub."
147,"Once you are in, wheelchair spaces are fine. However, wheelchair access to the venue is via a ramp at the rear of the tent. To get there you must be accompanied by staff along a bumpy, muddy path by the bins - not the most glamorous!"
148,"Free disabled parking at Argyll Street in St Andrews. Ample parking at Crusoe Hotel and Upper Largo Hotel. Old Manor Hotel is 5 minute walking distance from Homelands. We didn't use public transport, but I understand Stagecoach offer wheelchair accessible transport from most bus stops. There was a bus stop which was accessed via the shortcut through the bin store to the main road."
149,Staff are very nice and always chat and make you feel very welcome.
150,"Overall, very good for an old building, and there was nothing that we couldn't see. At the beginning and end of the tour we were separated from the group as they went up the steps in Westminster Hall so that we could use the lifts to the lobby, but as a result we did get to see a bit more of the building, including the medals collection and one of the libraries. Part of the disabled access route is outside, so be prepared for that. There is a bit of a bump after a steepish ramp to get into the cafe, but once inside it's spacious."
151,Doors were electric and automatic although some did have buttons too to open the door.  Due to all 3 lifts being refurbished at this station when we arrived at Watford Junction from Milton Keynes we had to be taken through a side gate and then taken by taxi to the front of the station to access the bus stops.  On the way back towards Birmingham New Street we once again had to be taken through a side gate and walked to the platform around the outside. 
152,"Step-free entry into the bookshop, but I was unable to get at most of the bookshelves. Not recommended for wheelchair users."
153,Staff are never very friendly in this store. The whole packing bags is a mess when they close the main tills early and make people use the express basket area. Very poorly designed.
154,Staff were friendly and accommodating 
155,Very friendly & helpfull.
156,"This is a terrific place for all ages. As the point is to get under the water slopes are involved. It can be done in a wheelchair, but quite a lot of uphill pushing is needed."
157,"The Assembly Rooms is a great venue for accessibility. Disabled parking is very near on George Street and is free.  Food and drinks are all available right outside the venue and are easily accessible. Inside the Assembly Rooms  there are no steps to manoeuvre on the ground floor and there is a good sized lift to take you to the upper floors.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  They formed a separate queue for the few people who were requiring easier access, which was a good idea and they let this queue in to choose their seats before the other people were ushered in. However, unfortunately we had to wait about 20 mins before they were allowed to open the door - for people in a wheelchair, this was not a problem, but there was only one seat close by, so some people were standing with walking sticks and looked quite uncomfortable with the long wait. This was not the fault of the staff as they must wait for the word from the performers that the sound check is complete before anyone is allowed in.  This was the only hitch in a lovely evening. Would definitely be happy to visit this venue again."
158,Right beside Vauxhall Station and opposite the bus station.
159,Staff were incredibly helpful and kind - will go above and beyond to make sure your visit is seamless and enjoyable. 
160,Blue badge parking right outside door with hard standing so easy to walk with sticks or use a wheelchair.
161,"Helpful staff. On arrival ramps readily available to get off the train. Offered assistance up to street level. Return journey seamless, met at barrier, advised where to go, met at platform and helped on to the train."
162,"Level access from pavement, wide enough for wheelchairs or mobility scooters inside"
163,"There are plenty of accessible toilets - at least one in each area. These sometimes double up as baby change and they are not RADAR locked, so sometimes I had a bit of a wait. They were mostly clean though and big enough to get in and out with my trike."
164,"The toilets are behind the reception area, including a unisex accessible toilet. There is level access from the reception/ bar. The accessible toilet is small but it accommodated us both - one in a Sunrise Quickie power-chair plus a carer. The wash-hand basin was low enough to allow access for the wheelchair user. Grab rails were black to contrast with the walls. There is no red cord but the working bar is opposite and staff are close by. "
165,"Parking is available across the road and there are a couple of disable spaces.  A short walk over to the entrance, which Is down a hill and a bit uneven, for someone in wheelchair may be a bit uncomfortable."
166,"Excellently accessible with ramps where necessary, wide, smooth concrete paths and boardwalks. Friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. "
167,"We asked about access and were given accurate and helpful information. I got in as a concession (£6.90) and my husband was free as an essential cater (not that I needed any assistance, but we were charged this amount without asking). "
168,"Good ground floor level access, very roomy even for large powerchair."
169,"The disabled toilet is not very big and a power chair cannot really be turned around inside it which means you have to reverse out and there is not much space to get out the door because there is quite a narrow corridor outside the door. In the narrow corridor there are often high chairs stacked up which mean that the door cannot open fully or, as in this visit, hardly at all! Please see photos"
170,"Transport to dancebase was probably its weakest point. There was a bus service running along the Grassmarket and some taxis were in evidence. You do have to walk, or wheel in my case, some distance from any parking space or bus stops. It was worth the effort so worth a try if you can ..."
171,"excellent access, some bumpy surfaces down near the marina (well they were for my small wheeled scooter).  Signs are tall, and I found them not very helpful.  You can't get lost, with it forming a square of ""streets"". There appears to be an upper level but i did not go and nor did I see a way other than stairs.  Lifts are medium size, and buttons at correct height for chairs."
172,"Easy to find, grab rails available. Enough room to manoeuvre and for a carer. Clean and tidy. No changing places toilet."
173,Both the entrance from the hotel side and the street was easily accessed by a wheelchair.
174,"Easy to find in main reception area. Clean, plenty of room to turn.  Plenty of grab rails in situ.  Room for a carer.  Assistance cord in situ ( complete with Euan’s Guide Red cord card!)"
175,It's wheelchair accessible. 
176,"What really aided access here was the spaciousness, lack of big crowds and the gently sloping astro-turfed ramps. It is a very relaxed environment, with headphones given to audience members who wish to watch the big screen comedy. This keeps it quieter, and there are less clashing noises all happening at once. At most you will have the chatter from people enjoying drinks or music from a band should there be one.   The open space is great! And the transparent roof shelter really helps to keep it bright and roomy. I think a greater choice of seating could improve this space, as it was mainly bean bags for kids, picnic tables or very low to the ground deck chairs. A few more separate tables and chairs would be helpful. "
177,"A very fancy place to go for drinks, snacks, afternoon tea, or dinner. Would recommend dressing up a bit if you're going, because it feels very grand!  Definitely an experience; good food, friendly staff, and gorgeous building.   Also has step free access and accessible toilet. So we're happy! Only got marked down half a star because of heavy doors to get in that aren't automatic. "
178,There are two accessible toilets on the ground floor. I didn’t see one in the stalls area. The one I used on the ground floor directly opposite the lift was very spacious. It included a changing area for babies which often cuts the space but not in this instance I could manoeuvre my large chair around with ease. Transfers onto the toilet would be either front on of from the left out of your wheelchair. All the usual grab rails you would expect. 
179,"Parking is of no problem, and although only two disabled bays, there is ample parking spaces. Coming along an inviting driveway you arrive right outside the entrance for the pub."
180,Accessible seating on the ground floor. Wheelchair spaces provided.
181,"There are 2 accessible loos on the ground floor - both are spacious enough to accommodate wheelchairs and carers, if neccessary.  They are kept clean and tidy and both are fitted with grab rails and overhead tracking hoists."
182,"We walked up the hill. It is a slope but manageable if you take your time browsing the many shops, closes and curiosities as you go. Just keep an eye out for the busking bag pipers as you have to wheel right in front of them and photo bomb the tourists’ pictures. "
183,A wheelchair accessible art gallery in the heart of Glasgow. There is a lovely cafe situated in the main lobby on the ground floor. The doors are wide enough for wheelchair access however some of the entrances do not have automatic doors. There is a lift on site which does not require staff permission for use which is ideal for accessing te second floor galleries. There is no audio in the lift. Overall I believe that Kelvingrove is a suitable place for all and a great way to spend a winter day. Wheelchair accessible parking is available on site also. 
184,Garden centre entrance has automatic door and there are long low gradient ramps to access all areas. Door to the Olive Tree cafe is very heavy so you need someone to open for you. Doorway to the accessible toilet is light and easy to open.
185,On street parking right outside the door. Level access into the store.
186,"Unfortunately there is no parking provided at the football ground, and so fans who wish to arrive by car must find on-street parking nearby. There is, however, an accessible bus that runs from Dundee City Centre up to the ground - perfect for any disabled fans looking to head in via public transportation. "
187,"There were two disabled loos, not radar key operated. Sadly both had rail on one side of the WC only, had wash basin and hand dryer at ""normal"" height no rather than lowered for wheelchair user and, worst of all, no alarm cord. So no way of summoning help. The third loo block at the far end of the site did not have a disabled loo, though was level access."
188,Not interested.
189,"Funky minimalist warehouse-y decor is the first thing you notice. Very spacious, helpful staff and great food. Will definitely be going back..."
190,There is a fairly large accessible loo with grab rails.
191,Car - Close train station (15 min walk)
192,The pub is near some bus stops & taxis do drop people off outside. The nearest tube stations are not wheelchair accessible.
193,"Edinburgh Airport has been striving to improve services to assistance passengers for years, and I think it is beginning to show.  Departures: You can go directly to the assistance reception if you want assistance from start to finish, but you need not deal with them if you don't want to. If you prefer to be independent through the airport, simply go and get a gate check tag for your chair from the baggage drop area and take yourself through departure procedures. You will be fast tracked through security even if you arrive without a member of staff, then you can make your own way to the gate area which is where you wait for security. You are then collected and taken down for assistance into the plane, there is no need to sit anywhere special and you are included in all the information given to other passengers. Staff have been very good at asking what way I prefer to be assisted.   Arrival: I am usually met fairly promptly and the wheelchair is brought to the plane. Beware that sometimes you get into the lift and then they drive you to the terminal and you get out again. If you are on a very nearby gate, you will go down in the lift and and straight out again. They don't always remember to tell you, so they stand there wondering why you didn't get out again already! All arrival procedures are in a short sequence, all on one level, very close to the exit and onward travel. "
194,"All facilities are in a temporary location until the new visitor centre is complete. Dedicated facilities with support are available for disabled people, take to the water, use an adapted bike or enjoy the walks with a mobility scooter. It is all here. Super pleasant staff, cafe, accessible toilet and “changing places” facility. "
195,"There is an accessible toilet. It's down a narrow corridor. Through the first door is a small room with a sink, this door locks and then a second door to the toilet. There is a grab rail.  The accessible toilet is quite small and while it was suitable for me with my crutch, I don't think it is wide enough to accomodate a wheelchair."
196,"There are 2 bedrooms with accessible bathrooms. In the ground floor communal space there are 2 accessible toilets. Both have the emergency red cord and grab rails. When I visited one of the emergency cords were not working and there was a sign on the door, advising people to go to the other accessible toilet if required. This cord also didn't reach to the ground. I informed staff and they were going to arrange to replace the cord."
197,"This is our favourite resteraunt and has fabulous food, great wheelchair access, the staff always make sure you are comfortable and well looked after. The facilities are a great size and spotlessly clean."
198,There was a lot of disabled parking which was very helpful.
199,"We made our way to the museum by train from Harrogate to York. The museum is located at the side of the train station, this was accessible by lift and a short walk around the corner to the museum. There were parking spaces outside the museum for anyone who may wish to travel by car. "
200,Access is from one of two entrances. Both have tarmac paths that loop around the park. There a benches to sit and watch the world go by. A large grass area and a children's play area.
201,"I'm a student at York St. John Uni and since I go there a lot I see that it is accessible to wheelchair users and people with other disabilities. I believe it's a friendly environmet and it doesn't necessarily mean you go there to study. I often meet up with my friends there to chat and I've also seen people doing craft projects there and the library staff can provide you with different crafting tools. There are toilets for disabled people and a lift for the higher floors. Also, just outside the library there is a small cafe and there's available parking space for wheelchair users."
202,Ask for the Zebra room when booking!
203,Good access for an old building.  Lower ground a bit cramped but still do-able (maybe better on a quieter weekday)
204,"Staff are outside and will take you in a side entrance which has a built in ramped hallway to a small lift, which then takes you to the correct level. Winding corridors and turns but nice and light. Toilet is behind a fire exit door so not usually misused. Low toilet but there is a clip on seat raiser to take the toilet to wheelchair height. Very hilly in auditorium which was an issue to to my core strength as you tilt sideways to access the seats and then have to sit at an angle in your chair if in row O otherwise the person behind can’t fit in their seat with leg room. Due to this I wouldn’t go again as it was really comfortable as I had to hold myself upright during the show.   There is no on-site car park but they state there are two spaces in the small road behind them (not their spaces). We tried this but unfortunately the spaces are out of use until late May 2022 due to building work. We ended up parking off Carnaby Street. "
205,The museum has 1  lift but if you walk right through on the 1st floor you have to go all the way back the same way.  A 2nd lift would be useful.  The lift only fits 1 wheelchair in and so if you go as a group it takes a long time to access the floors. From where we parked our bus it was quick to get into the building and we were then at the information centre inside. The information signs needed you to be able to read but we gather from their website that you can hire audio guides.  There is no braille information for visually impaired people.
206,"The nearest tube stations to the hospital are Euston Square, which is only step free westbound, and Warren Street. The nearest step free station is King's Cross. There are also several buses that stop outside the hospital entrance on Euston Road."
207,"The biggest challenge was getting into the woods. With the exception of Teversal Visitor Centre, which had an open entry point, all the other entry points seemed to have some kind of barrier... gate, A-frame, big block of wood, etc. We almost gave up, it was so bad... but I'm glad we persisted.  Once inside, there are many paths, mostly wide and compacted gravel. There are some extremely steep hills but you can go where you like and choose routes that suit you. There are several trails that are old railway lines, so they are mostly flat. You can do short circular walks or long there and back trails.   It was excellent for dog walking as there are no vehicles allowed on the trails. We passed a couple of cyclists and there was sufficient horse manure to suggest people ride there, but we didn't see any. We will definitely go back there as the walks were perfect for us... however, they should look at some RADAR locked gates to improve accessibility!"
208,Straight in from the street with no steps. Main waiting area for a table is up a couple of steps however there is a small area to stay without having to go up the steps.  The bar is in the waiting area but staff will bring a drink to anyone having to wait in the lower area.
209,"I visited Saffron Screen for an autism-friendly screening with my ASD son.  The staff were very helpful, we used the Social Story provided to prepare for our visit, and the provisions for the screening were very welcome (low lighting throughout, lower volume).  A really lovely, welcoming and inclusive afternoon out!"
210,"Wow what a joy!! These were absolutely ace! Firstly there was a Changing Places complete with Hoist, Medi Bed etc. There were at least 6 accessible loos - and they were all massive. There was a decent walkway up to them too."
211,"The entrance to the theatre is on Belvedere Road and there is NO access from the River Thames side of County Hall. From the Belvedere Road entrance there are 6 steps up to the entrance and there is no hand rail.  Just to the left of the entrance is a platform lift with a bell and intercom. I access via the steps and arrived in the entrance hall which has a staircase directly in front. I don't notice a sign to the lift to the 1st floor but when I asked I was immediately escorted to the lift and taken upstairs. The lift is in a separate area and there is a code to access the lift which is operated by the member of staff who escorts you. The main staircase to the 1st floor has a ""strange"" build in handrail on both sides, as you are unable to grab round it to help to pull you up, it is more there for decoration and there is no hand rail for the few couple of stairs. Please see the photo as it is difficult to describe. In the foyer area there is a bar but it is only accessible by 7 steps and there is no handrail.  The foyer on the 1st floor, outside the stalls, has limited seating, on low level window stills. There are some stools but there is a note on them saying not to sit down on them and I later found out that they are part of the set. The back row of the stalls is step free and all other rows of seats in the stalls can only be accessed via steps, again see photo. The Gallery seating is only accessible via stairs. In the interval there is a person selling ice creams on the 1st floor foyer at the top of the stairs, so there is step free access to this."
212,"There are several disabled spaces right next to the entrance, but it's a small gravel carpark so you could park anywhere and be within easy reach of it."
213,Wetroom bathroom with plenty of space for carer. For those that travel a shower chair - ours did not fit over the toilet.
214,"The Museum of London was above street level from where I approached so was a little confusing until I discovered the lifts. I saw two at different sides of the street. They take you up to the main outdoor area where you see the main entrance. Through the automatic doors and the museum is modern with ramped access and lifts to all levels. Lots of space, with things easy to to see and enjoy from wheelchair height."
215,There is a large car park at the back but when you arrive and depart you can park at the front doors to make life simpler for access for the guest and unloading all equipment. Conceierge are very good at coming out to help take everything to your room. 
216,Every staff member that I interacted with was very friendly and the person I contacted about the accessibility on Facebook was very friendly. They remembered me contacting them when I arrived and helped me inside.
217,Disabled toilet is at the entrance to the conservatory. Red cord does not reach the floor 
218,Large accessible loo on the main concourse. It has a RADAR lock.
219,"A fantastic trip, to welcome the reopened theatres, "
220,Disabled loo available and accessible but I have never had cause to use them so cannot vomment further.
221,"It was fantastic, I will be definitely do again. The staff are very friendly and great what they do"
222,The National Museum of Ireland in Dublin is highly accessible to all. We had a great day out. There were lot's of interesting exhibits and  I found the staff extremely helpful and friendly. There were some accessibility issues. I attended with my cousin who has a hearing impairment and she found it enjoyable to use the touchable exhibits but due to lack of  induction loops and background noise she found it difficult to fully enjoy the day.
223,We researched the place before our visit to ensure there was wheelchair  Access.  There is ample car parking for a fee.  There is a map illustrating different routes around the park but no actual markers along the paths.   The views and trees are stunning but the paths are gravelled and there are plenty  of undulations not ideal for a chaired person.  It was hard work wheeling and pushing.  We prefer nearby Bradgate Park with its tarmac pathways .  
224,There are pay and display disabled parking spaces 50m away from the venue.
225,Hoist and changingbench in the changing rooms Hoist access to the pool 
226,Parking by entrance in marked bays.
227,"There were portaloos, including accessible ones. I didn't make use of these though, so cannot comment further!"
228,Well signposted disabled door. Staff saw us parking so we're waiting at the door but there's a bell you can use to gain access
229,Access is generally very good 
230,Disabled loo direct off the restaurant. Grab rails & emergency pull cord.
231,"Babbacombe Cliff Railway is a funicular railway, which links Babbacombe Downs with Oddicombe Beach. The journey only takes a couple of minutes but it's a fun way to travel and the views are lovely."
232,"Automatic sliding doors, platform or conventional lifts, good signage, an excellent accessible loo, friendly and helpful staff, a pleasant cafe and excellent displays on the history of Amsterdam - what's not to like?"
233,"There are a lot of buses that go up South Bridge. Get off at the stop just before Nicholson Square. We needed to park & got a space in Nicholson Square and crossed the road. Its pretty busy so not brilliant, but doable. "
234,Accessible toilet was roomy enough.  Is also had a baby changing facility in it.  Clean & tidy.
235,"I entered the building via the Candleriggs, this entrance has automatic doors. Because I was attending the event with the GDA I had had plenty of assistance. There was also plenty of venue staff on hand so I had no problem with the internal doors."
236,"Brodie castle is a lovely place to visit on a summer’s day. There’s not much to see inside as,  with many Scottish castles, access is limited. But you can get around the small ground floor, see some artifacts and visit the gift shop. There was the odd step but staff lowered a wooden portable ramp where needed.  The tea room is very small and accsessed from the courtyard. We sat outside as it was sunny. I think it would be extremely difficult to sit inside. Food was lovely and staff were attentive. The gardens are doable in a power chair but the paths can get a bit rough. There’s the usual gravel everywhere...but lots of open grounds in which to exercise my assistance dog. (Staff were knowledgeable about his having access to both inside the castle and the tearoom.) "
237,"Ramp to front door, no steps to reception or meeting rooms"
238,"Does not look it from the outside, but you can enter via the building next door which has a wheelchair lift to get you up the couple of steps.   Disabled parking spaces right outside, just across the road from the art gallery entrance. What made me want to recommend it was that manageress was so helpful and cheery ... so much so that we went back a second time after visiting the gallery next door!  The coffee was so much better than the usual chains and they served a really nice cola (Karma?) plus tasty snacks. Had a disabled toilet - see photo. Felt much more special than just going to one of the chains."
239,"The accessible loo is on the ground floor. The door is wide and although the loo is relatively small there would be room for side transfer provided you moved the Hi-Tech litter bin. The toilet has grab rails, the loo paper dispenser is within reach and there's an approachable washbasin. The alarm cord is of the excellent Dutch type - it goes most of the way round the room at skirting board level."
240,"Friendly staff, no issues. "
241,Parking has not been thought about when the place was built
242,"The new Marks and Spencer’s in Oban is very accessible with good disabled parking, disabled toilets, wide aisles and friendly staff! "
243,"Good public transport links, but very limited parking on the streets of York. The museum might have a separate car park but I'm unsure as I walked from the train station (around 10 minutes)."
244,Staff are very friendly and happy to help
245,"When leaving the car I came across a ramp to access the building that has a gradient suitable for a mountain goat - definitely not for those who have difficulty walking (I use a four wheel walker). Going in was bad enough, but coming out (with brakes full on) was pretty terrifying. I wasn't sure if I'd end up on the roadway! I should imagine that a wheelchair pusher would have to be pretty fit to assist their charge, or risk a heart attack themselves! The female disabled toilet was clean to a basic level, though smelled. There was then another ramp to take you up to the eating area, not the easiest gradient but much better than the external. This area was not the most inspiring, so a cup of coffee was all that was consumed."
246,"The theatre charges people in wheelchair full price to sit in the aisle at the edge of the auditorium with the worst view.  They do have a Disability Access Scheme which offers some discounts, but it takes them two weeks to process an application. I called almost 3 weeks before the show we wanted to see but ""it won't be done in time and you have to pay 7 days in advance, so if you want to come you'll have to pay full price."" Basic access is good but unlike other theatres where people in wheelchairs are seated with the rest of the public, here you are stuck out on the end. This means you don't quite get to seat with your companions and your wheelchair obstructs access to the seats for able bodies users."
247,"Manor West retail park is situated on the outskirts of Tralee town centre.   It is open seven days and week, providing a variety of shops and restaurants/cafes to suit everyone, all with friendly staff.  Some of the stores are located indoors and others outdoors, however all are easily accessible. "
248,"The Staff during the visit, without fail, were all friendly and welcoming. Helping with the odd door or two, chatting about the exhibits and generally making you feel very welcome."
249,"Top marks.  Extremely impressed.  Signage was clear and stood out.  Toilets were many including wide cubicles, disabled toilets and changing places toilet and seperate rooms for baby changing and breast feeding so no need to share disabled toilets with stinky nappies! There was plenty of seating around the park and designated seating for those with disabled access passes to wait on their turn on rides.  This was a godsend for me personally.  I cannot comment on hearing or communications access, however it appeared they had put a lot of work into this area of accessibility too."
250,No disabled toilet and there is a step at the entrance. However the toilets were very clean and well kept. The toilets are half way down the slope to the beach and you can get right up to the one step before entering the toilets.
251,By car there are a large number of Disabled spaces just show blue badge to parking attendant There are busses and collection by car if bus is not possible
252,"There are 3 bays available, quite close to foyer, with a ramp to get you up and into foyer which is on the level. Parking is free with the use of a passcode needed to lift barriers, and supplied number given at reception desk."
253,"Accessible in all areas, good lifts, good toilets (with one gripe), friendly staff. One star lost overall for ramshackle not-fit-for-purpose borrowable wheelchairs, and for an out-of-reach red emergency cord in the accessible toilet (see below)."
254,"ramps where needed, automatic doors clearly marked"
255,There is some parking on George Street and buses also run along the street. Loads of taxis around if you need one.
256,"They were very helpful, and seemed ery keen to do a good job."
257,Very friendly staff. Security stewards also endured no one wandered into our area to misuse the space that was allocated to disabled guests during the concert.
258,"Wet room with grab handles, adjustable shower. shower seat as requested on booking. Toilet which had a raised seat and grab bars."
259,The toilets in Homelands are excellent but I would not like to comment on disabled toilets generally as we did not require them.
260,A full five stars. Great access with excellent staff.
261,Disabled toilet is on main floor. Disabled seating in 2 floors up. The lift can only take one wheelchair and maybe 2 slim people at a time. I have been late back to the performance because I couldn’t get an empty lift 
262,Can only give 3 stars as the hotel manager let it down. All other staff are friendly and helpful and will do whatever they can to help! 
263,Level access into the shop. Seating at the back which can be moved to make space (although its relatively tight). Pretty large accessible loo at the back.
264,The staff I met were simply great and it was their attitude and approach that left its mark in a positive way. So often places can be accessible but not feel that inclusive. Here was a theatre where it was superbly accessible but also inclusive in that there was a warm welcome and relaxed approach to enabling me to participate in the tour and enjoy the experience just like everyone else - well done Edinburgh Theatres!
265,"A staff member showed me the way to the accessible loo because the old building can be a bit of a rabbit warren. It was modern, big and clean, with good rails and even some natural light from a high window."
266,Clearly signed. Once in it was great but quite a tight squeeze to manoeuvre through the doors. May need help from staff or carer. Had its own version of a red cord card. 
267,We parked at the st David's car park and made the mistake of going to the wrong location as the sat nav sent us out of the shopping centre. The hall is in the shopping centre. Follow the signs to shopping and it's a short walk to the venue. It needed better sign posting realistically
268,Everyone I met was pleasant enough.
269,good access lots of entrances and exists some better than others but all accessible
270,"Vieux Nice is a relatively small, mostly flat and mainly pedestrianised area. The shopping area gently slopes at the furthest points from the sea front. There is a maze of narrow streets and squares, so it’s fine at quieter time but in the busy summer season it may feel quite crowded. The tall, historic buildings have ochre, yellow and red facades, making the area very photogenic. This is also a residential area so look up and you might see someone’s washing on their clothes line. There are no benches in the area, but there are lots of cafes is you want to rest. Most of the cafes have some outdoor seating and it makes it a great place to people watch.  Directly behind the sea front is Cours Saleya, market place. This is a large rectangular, flat padestrianised square. It hosts a daily flower market held in the mornings, up until about 12 – 1pm, so I suggest getting there by mid- morning, as when the stalls have sold their produce they start to close up. Monday to Saturday there is also a food market and on Sundays an antiques/ flea market. Even if you are not into shopping the market is a must see. The flower stalls are impressive with their seasonal displays. The food stalls sell local home grown fruits and vegetables plus there are cheese stalls, olive oil stalls, and ones selling olives, herbs and spices. Look out for Chez Thérésa's stall in the market which sells slice of socca (a large, chickpea pancake, a regional dish) which is delivered by motor bike, see photo from my previous visit. The gift stalls sell high quality, local products and crafts, including stalls selling prettily, coloured soaps in an assortment of floral fragrances. The stalls are quite spaciously laid out in rows. Surrounding the Cours Selaya are restaurants and bars which stay open until the evening and it's a great place to people watch. If you visit Cours Saleya, watch out as they wash down the stall area regularly, which can make the pavement a little slippy at times.  Behind Cours Saleya there’s lots of local shops, cafes, restaurants. Mostly in narrow streets. This is a place to wander around and explore. There are some lovely take away cake places, my favourites are Boulangerie du Palais, 21 Rue du Marché (look out for their pig cakes), and Boulangerie Blanc, 10 Rue Alexandre Mari, both with a single entrance step and Patisserie LAC, 12 Rue de la Préfecture, which is also a chocolate shop and step free. Maison Auer, 7 Rue Saint-François de Paule, directly opposite the Opera House (see seperate review). There is a small step into this beautiful chocolate shop and if you visit remember to take a look at the ceiling in the room at the back (I put some photos of the chocolate shop on my Christmas Nice review).   Look out on Rue de la Préfecture for Loggia Communale, with a small display of historic stones and sculptures, see photo. There are several picturesque square including Place Rossetti, where Cathedral Sainte Reparate (separate review) is and several restaurants.  Vieux Nice is a place I never tire of visiting as there is always something new to catch my attention, and on this visit I discovered the lovely Place St Francois, which houses a fish market, although it was closed when I visited."
271,I needed to ask where the accessible toilet was and a staff member brought the key and showed me. You have to go back out to the porch where the loo was but it didn't open straight into the path of people going in or out of the pub. The toilet area was clean with everything within reach. The hand dryer was actually a good one and powerful one. There was a handrail but it would have needed moving down. I couldn't have done it on my own or reached it due to the sanitary box next to the loo. There wasn't a Changing Places toilet and it would have been a squash to have 2 people in there plus a wheelchair.
272,The paths around park are flat and wide and free of obstacles.
273,Lower level to restaurant accessible.
274,"There is a great deal of parking space, although none of the spaces are specifically Blue Badge ones. When you enter there is some parking in front of you, but much more over to the right beyond the kiosk which is not immediately visible. Almost all of the parking is tarmac.  Parking for Blue Badge holders is free but there is a small charge for others."
275,A wheelchair accesible Pier with a lift and accessibel toilets nearer the end of the Pier
276,"Parking facilities for away supporters are located off Queens Road by the Barnsley metrodome leisure facility. The parking spaces are on quite a steep hill with only a few spaces that provide parking with flat access and it is possible that you may get blocked in, with a long wait to get out at the end of the game. However, if you get to the ground early there are spaces outside the metrodome leisure center, which are a lot more spacious and easier to use for people who are less ambulant, yet these are a bit of a walk from the stadium."
277,"I git the train through from Glasgow, and despite major works going on in and around the station, the journey was perfect.   The station is directly across the street from the entrance of discovery point."
278,"There are no Morrison’s stores where I live, so this was a very welcome and positive experience to get groceries and have a cuppa afterwards. Very spacious with wide accessible aisles, lots of staff to assist with getting things from out of reach places - this in itself a real bonus. Whilst a lot of their core produce is their own brand, it’s good to get unusual things that you know only come from where they originated from. So, don’t mind a wee bit of Shipley, Yorkshire in Scotland. A fully provisioned and very busy cafe serving again, their own branded products at excellent prices. Bags of room for those of us who need it with priority seating and service. Assistance dogs welcome and very helpful and attentive staff. What’s useful, is they have little lockers for your trolly so you don’t have to think about it getting in the way of you and others, one customer was assisted by staff to the car park. Can’t complain about the cuppa for a ‘ store ‘ service at all, brought over for me. Did not use the loos but was informed they were fully access available equipped and well serviced."
279,"I enjoyed the tour round this beautiful Essex Wildlife Trust reserve, with its varied habitats. The highlight for me was the birdsong, especially the nightingales and the lambs you can see from the visitor centre were very cute!"
280,Good signage.  Level access.  Automatic doors.  Lift to all levels.  Seating provided.
281,The toilets were fairly clean but unfortunately not very big. They proved a very tight squeeze for myself and my carer to get into and use successfully. We ended up feeling like sardines by the end of the day.
282,The staff were fantastic and friendly. 
283,The toilets are situated in a very central position although there is only one
284,"There are a few different car parks within the grounds of the Falkirk Wheel which are all a different distance from the visitors centre. I think there are disabled parking spaces in each car park however, right beside the the visitors centre there are about 4 disabled parking spaces. Every visitor needs to pay £3.40 to park in the car park, including visitors with a blue badge. This amount is for the whole day and if you are able too, there are also lovely nature walks beside the Falkirk Wheel.  As I’m not from this area I don’t know anything about public transport here but, I did notice there was a bus stop at the Falkirk Wheel."
285,"Although not very noticeable, there are limited blue badge parking spaces located at the back of the theatre, but the distance from the car park to the building is appropriate"
286,"There are many disabled spots lined up in front of the building, also with the pool being almost in the center of Coatbridge there are regular buses for those who cannot drive. "
287,"Fully accessible toilets, with hand rails, and  plenty of room for manoeuvring an wheelchair. "
288,Parking outside lodge
289,To get to the hotel by car you have to get through some fairly narrow street. They have an underground carpark just round the corner from the main entrance and a drop off point right outside the entrance. The carpark is unsuitable for vehicles with a topbox.
290,Staff were helpful and cheerful 
291,"On arrival I was very pleased to see that the shop was one level and had disabled parking very close to the shop entrance. This ensures easy accessibility to all areas of the shop, including the café. All aisles of the store bar a couple were wide enough for wheelchair users. Due to a few aisles having very prominent and large pillars it meant that no wheelchair user could access them, which is a problem. In terms of toilet facilities Tesco Craigmarloch did have a disabled toilet, although it did have an emergency lever it was lacking in basic facilities. Such as; a working hand dryer, clean and refilled soap and a larger sink. All the staff were very friendly and helpful on our visit, I cannot fault them. "
292,"This venue is totally wheelchair freindly, their is no were un-accessible for people with a disability"
293,"The manager in particular is exceptionally friendly and helpful, communicating by text, describing things well, orienting me etc."
294,"The toilet facilities were very easy to find and they were very spacious and private. The height of the sink was great for wheelchair users and the toilet had adjustments around it for assistance. The bathroom was really nice and didn't feel clinical at all (like some accessible hotels have felt in the past). There was a shower seat and the whole bathroom was very clean. Bathrooms in the bedrooms were second to none, the wet floor system was the icing on the cake for accessibility."
295,"There is an accessible bathroom but there are many problems: 1. The door which the public use is controlled by a radar key handle which is at the right level. But there is also much higher up lock which must be turned. 2. There are two doors into the disabled toilet - one lead into the public area and the other leading directly into the dressing room for the acts. The store has a small lock which must be turned otherwise people will come into the toilet and invited! Even if the door is locked, the handle will go and you will do a very nervous wee! 3. There is only one drop down rail on one side the toilet, the other side is completely open and too far away from the wall for you to use it as a support. 4. The disabled toilet is used as a changing area for the act and so you may have to wait a long time until you can get in."
296,"Rails just way out of position to the actual loo, and toilet so very low. "
297,The Intu Potteries is situated in city centre of Hanley. It has a variety of different shops and restaurants within the shopping centre which have easy access. There are lifts inside which allow access to each level within the shopping centre. 
298,"Everyman has an adjacent NCP car park with blue badge spaces but there are charges. There are local accessible buses,  taxis and train stations."
299,People are very kind and professional.
300,"Lots of Blue Badge spaces in each inside car park and directions to cinema clearly signed. Lifts at each car park and level access from there to the venue. Bus stops outside the building (flat access). Ask taxi to drop you at ""the outside car park where Debenhams used to be"" and you'll enter the building with the lift straight ahead of you."
301,Access was surprisingly good once you find the side door.
302,"The staff at the zoo couldn't do enough for us. They took us to the front of the queue, so our dog didn't overheat - it was a very hot day, they gave her shade and plenty of cold water. How thoughtful."
303,Couldn't fault them. Outstanding service!  And that was being assisted by several different people. Extremely impressed with the service!!
304,My first time at the FlyDSA Arena and it won't be my last as I was very impressed with wheelchair accessibility. We travelled from Scotland to see The 1975 and it was one of the best shows I've ever seen.
305,You rely on staff to open doors along the way but they try to make it as easy as possible for you.
306,"The hotel is very close to Waverley Railway Station being only a five-minute walk from the Market Street entrance to the station. Taxis stop at the taxi rank outside the station.   A short distance from the hotel, around 500m, on Waverley Bridge you can find the Airport Bus service. There is also an Edinburgh Transport Shop where you can get tickets for Lothian Buses, the tram and for the tour buses.    The hotel does not have any dedicated parking. On street parking is available outside the hotel and in some adjacent streets. There are also car park facilities at the railway station.  Buses to all parts of the city pass along Princes Street which is a ten-minute walk from the hotel."
307,"The toilet is inside the building. It is very spacious and has grab rails on both sides.    We were pleasantly surprised that it was open, even on Christmas Eve."
308,Very close to Pimlico underground station. 
309,"There are two glass doors to get in. The first opens into the restaurant and the second opens out which I’d keep in mind. There are different types of seating - bench, stools, booths and staff are happy to let you choose from whats available. Depending on where you sit it can be a tight fit. The ordering area is quite high for wheelchair users but staff are happy to accomodate. The area to get drinks, napkins, cutlery and sauces are low down and there is space to move around here between the main seating area"
310,"Access is tight unless you have a standard manual wheelchair.  It is further compromised by the fact that the handrail doesn't lock up.  It is, however, very clean."
311,"Didn't ask for any help, just paid the requested donation for entry."
312,The venue is in the heart of Glasgow city centre. There is a NCP car just a few metres away and also trains and busses all within a very short distance. There are also parking spaces outside the shop but they seem to be like gold dust and probably a little tricky to get one.
313,"Didn't go in but just by the entrance door.  A modern building which looked as though it had taken disability access into account when designed, I would guess that the disabled loos were up to standard."
314,"As a wheelchair user I really have to compliment the owners of this superb classic car collection.  The set up made getting about so easy, especially with the way the cars were displayed.  There was adequate room for a wheelchair user to get up close enough to look through the windows and get detail of the cars. There is a lift down to one level then a platform lifts to the next. The turnstiles are wheelchair accessible as well as an accessible toilet.  There is also a souvenir shop as well as a  Café."
315,We drove to the accommodation. The parking space was level although the site is on a hillside. 
316,"Visited here, with my walker, my disability means i have trouble steps and slopes. No steps at all here which is rare and great, lots of space to get through with my walker and to leave it at the side of the table. The staff wanted to help as much as they can, asking where i wanted to sit- what was best and how they could help, allowing me time to settle (i'm not very speedy). Well done staff for making the experience comfortable. Disabled toilet at the back of the restaurant, only down side is parking is hard as its in town but there is trinity square car park behind."
317,All very friendly and helpful. Also willing to listen to suggestions.
318,No patronising attitudes. I was treated like any other visitor. Perfect!
319,A large disabled toilet with easy access.
320,Richmond Station is nearby and staff are always on hand to provide ramp and other assistance. Many bus routes serve Richmond.
321,The rest of the restaurant is great for access and the waiting staff let me sit wherever I want and store my powerchair.
322,Plenty of disabled parking near the ramped entrance. All areas of the tour accessible and very helpful tour guides. Accessible cafe and clean disabled toilet. When booking inform them of your mobility needs. 
323,"This beautiful, historic church has good access facilities and welcoming, helpful volunteer staff. It is also where Agatha Christie was married. "
324,All these buses were wheelchair accessible which was great. But as you are sitting on the ground floor the view really isn't the best. As most of the tour was talking about what you could see above us or in the distance we missed a lot of it! However it was a great way to get around the city. Also the stop that they had for the high line looked like it didn't have any wheelchair access.
325,"Coming off a main countryside road, a long driveway led to the riding school, before a scenic tree lined avenue took us towards the car park area. "
326,once inside its excellent but there is a small step to get to the front door. 
327,"Very pleasant, helpful and friendly. "
328,Garden Wise is a wonderful place to visit.  The cafe also sells really yummy food.  Sometimes it is quite difficult to navigate around Garden Wise as there can be things lying on the floor which are difficult to see.
329,Very good staff they were friendly and helpful.
330,There is a lowered kerb in the car Park which is flush with the parking bays to allow easy access. Also there is a wide ramp to the entrance of the building. The glass doors allow the staff to see who is comming and going from the restraunt and if you cannot manage the doors they will come and assist you! 
331,"The hotel public spaces such as the breakfast room,bar and restaurant were fully wheel chair accessible . The groundfloor bedroom and ensuite wheel in shower room were also fully wheelchair accessible . A lovely clean quiet hotel with good facilities for a wheel chair user. Helpful and friendly staff."
332,Staff knew little or nothing about hearing loops. Were'n't unhelpful but weren't helpful either.
333,"Based on the currently neglected east side of Birmingham, there is a multi story car pack with lots of disabled parking, (may be challenging for colour blind drivers, as bays and walk ways are marked red for the disabled, blue car parking and green walk ways)"
334,"Limited beach disabled parking as in any other town country wide, But the 600 yard walk round to the beach hut in the harbour. "
335,There are toilets outside at the east end of the cathedral. They were clean but not as spacious as I would like. 
336,"Staff were informative and very helpful throughout. My PA was unable to come with me on my most recent visit, so staff were happy to escort me to my wheelchair space and out at the interval and the end."
337,Fantastic! Plenty of spaces with lots of room to get in and out the car.
338,"there should be dedicated priority seating for disabled people! I booked tickets to a comedy show and emailing and filling in an online form didn't help, add I got ignored. yes no responses from their so called customer service. I I called and asked about disabled seating for the Billy Connolly show. I was asked ""can she transfer"" when asking about starting for my Mother - currently wheelchair bound. I am so appalled at this"
339,Very limited parking although there is a car park at the top of Queen Street (opposite the Job Centre) Tram stops within a 5 minute walk 
340,"The disabled access is limited when entering the Castle due to the old architecture of the buildings, although there is still a good view point of the Castle which is wheel chair accessible. The gardens themselves are beautiful and proivde many water features, wooden swings and quirky designs fun for both adults and children. There are disabled toilets available and a lift one part of the castle for anyone whom requires it except it does not fit a wheel chair inside. "
341,"The upper floor is entered directly from the carpark area. Doors are all wide enough and loads of space to turn inside. The open plan living area is spacious with smooth wood-style flooring - kitchen/dining/sitting areas. The stunning thing is the views on all sides but particularly straight ahead through the front glass wall/windows opening onto the balcony. Kitchen has adjustable height sink/hob/ surface. Just off the entrance area there is a utility room with high disabled WC/ usual griprails/ emergency call buttons/ a washbasin with grips and you can get a wheelchair under. Then there is a lift with plenty of turning space to get in and out. This takes you down to the 4 lower floor bedrooms & 3 bathrooms. Corridor is fine for wheelchair if you drive straight! Master bedroom is large with lots of space partic on left hand side of the bed. Shower - disabled seat and grips -and washbasin are good. WC has  all the usual grips.  It is low - may be good for some, not so good for others ( but utility room WC is high so you have a choice!). Bath has no grips at all. 2 bedrooms are ensuite. Beds 3&4 share a  wet room. Side door is accessible leading out to smooth path to patio area. Patio also accessible from master bedroom.  "
342,"Parking directly outside, lowered kerb with KEEP CLEAR sign.  On bus route."
343,"The Little Red Train is a great way to explore the area. Particularly if you're visually impaired like me or don't want to be walking too far. It is an open sided train albeit powered by what looks like a car engine cunningly designed as a Thomas the Tank Engine style train.  I particularly liked the audio commentary as it was available in what I guess was Greek and more importantly for me; English. A great way to find out what is around and what you're looking at without having to struggle with maps, guide books and magnifying glasses.  The train chugs along at a fair pace; I guess it could be 30 miles per hour at times but you can easily see the sights. The seats are padded and fairly comfortable but the train does bounce around a bit. You need a steady camera hand if you plan on taking pictures!"
344,staff talking didn't want to interrupt
345,"No changing places toilet and a bit of a scrum if people are all coming out of the toilets at once. The door to the disabled toilet totally blocks off the ladies loo when it is open and it is a bit of a tight turn up a slight ramp into the toilet, not made easier by having to back in. That said it was a little on the small side but clean and not cluttered."
346,"Lead from the entrance to my seat of which I was given options, by efficient and polite staff. I didn't see any after the show but it was easy to find the way out by following the flow of people."
347,"Lovely food, drinks, ambience and staff; just not good enough on the access front."
348,I arrived at the museum from using public transport. It was easy to find the museum and only around ten minutes wheeling from the railway station. There were accessible parking bays in the streets along side the museum.
349,"Me, my 2 brothers and my dad all stayed in this Premier Inn on the 7th of January before we went to Edinburgh airport and we also stayed in the Premier Inn on the 15th of January and it was a very present stay. Nice staff, good wheelchair accessible rooms and an excellent breakfast. Would highly recommend especially if using for going to Edinburgh airport. "
350,"I visited on the second day of opening under COVID restrictions : I won’t go into all the details here, they are on the NGS website, but all people are required to wear masks, you must book ahead, you get an hour for your visit, and you are only visiting the ground floor rooms. I had no trouble with access, there were many helpful staff, the ramp was well designed, the gallery was largely empty, so I was able to see many more paintings than usual, and look at the smaller works for as long as I wanted. It is really a good opportunity to see these rooms, which do include some very famous renaissance and Scottish artists, without the usual crowds. Tickets are free.   My only problem was with using the disabled loo, ordinarily I would have used the modern one on the lower ground floor, but this is closed off from access from the gallery. I visited with my scooter, which is very small, 52cm wide and 1m long. The door and corridor to the loo was really only wide enough for this, and while the scooter did fit inside the loo there was no room to turn around. The doors were very hard to open, but here the staff were very willing to help. My only negative was that not only was the emergency cord tied up, it had clearly been cut so it couldn’t drop to the floor. There is probably not much NGS can do about the size of the loo, but I did point the cord problem out to the staff (who very concerned and promised to fix it).  "
351,We visited the Jorvik Viking Centre using my son's Max Card. I pre-booked our time slot prior to our visit. The website contains lots of accessibility information and a visual story. My son is Autistic so this was really useful. We arrived early for our timeslot. The man on the desk noticed our Max Card so let us go in a bit earlier. We were offered a sensory pack to borrow for our visit. My son loved the cart that took us through the Viking Settlement. The only negative was having to exit through the giftshop- my son had a huge meltdown in there. (To be fair I'm not sure if there was another exit that avoids the giftshop.) 
352,This lovely garden centre has a wide range of products and does marvellous food.
353,There is disabled parking within 50 yards of the entrance.
354,Not brilliant 
355,"Refused to listen, humiliated me in the reception area, kept telling me that what I was saying wasn’t true until I showed them. There was one concierge who was lovely, but the managers were awful. Weren’t prepared to help rectify the issues at all. No disability awareness, eg they kept saying things like ‘no one else has had any problems’ ‘another wheelchair got in the room’ ‘gave you tried getting into the room’. The default is also to charge disabled people double the usual room rate for an accessible room as they had to use a suite because of the space needed. "
356,"The staff (and the food) really make this place. Taking my son out for meals is an important part of our life as a family. He enjoys the social opportunities it provides. At Mia's all the staff - owner, waiters and kitchen staff make him feel welcome."
357,"Travelodge sells some rooms as accessible.   They aren’t.   These rooms have a double bed plus a fold out bed, suitable for a child but not great as a second bed.       The bathrooms have a low edge bath with shower over.   This isn’t ‘accessible’ in any sense that I understand the word.     Very cross as I’d checked it was a proper twin accessible room with staff by telephone prior to booking.    Basically, they lied.  "
358,"Can only drive here from where I am, There are disabled spaces so you won’t need to use  lift or slopes to get to the upper level of shops and restaurants. There are limited spaces but I've never not been able to get one since I got my blue badge,  parking i free if you register your badge and car registration at the information desk (not sure if it's still staffed at present though)."
359,"All bathrooms were accessible, but not up to the standard of the UK or Japan."
360,Good sized toilet with grab bars and space for a wheelchair . No adult changing space but the whole toilet was well kept and clean .
361,The store has an open level access entrance. There's plenty of space to get around to see the various toys on display.
362,Parking was easy to find and right next to the entrance to the stadium. There were plenty of places and there were no issues for the Powerchair.
363,Just fab! organised and made you feel very welcome. weren't phased at all. knowledgeable about where to go and helpful when you got there. probably worth mentioning the George Square Gardens staff too... we planned to go into the Gardens for a drink afterwards - the bouncer told us that there was step free access - but if it was a bit steep he advised us we could use the other entrance. All set to bypass the queue and enter.... and then thwarted! Turns out we had a teenager in our midst and minors aren't allowed in the garden after 9.... we'll remember that next time!! And didn't spoil our night as we had a beer at the corner bar instead...
364,There are lots of spaces available 
365,"The staff were helpful when asked to help, but they weren't needed for things very often. They are used to supporting the wheelchair sports groups, so had things organised for us arriving."
366,"Bit of a walk down a sloping pier to the pontoon where the boat leads from, but the pier has been constructed in non-slip material making it easier to keep balance."
367,The staff I had dealings with were very friendly and extremely helpful.
368,As I said in the introduction it is fine for manual wheelchairs but it is advisable to book in advance to ensure staff are pre-warned. There is more than ample room to manoeuvre the chair in the restaurant. 3 star rating only because it is not accessible for electric wheelchairs yet. Watch this space or the restaurant's website. 
369,Didn't particularly interact with staff but all seemed friendly and smiley.
370,"Great food, even better cocktails! Brilliant atmosphere. Always busy so advisable to book. Staff helpful."
371,"Not really an accessible toilet. But it has potential, see pictures. "
372,Staff could not be more helpful and considerate
373,"Very helpful and friendly staff, all willing to help and show us around their marvellous facilities."
374,"They did exactly what was needed, in a conscientious and professional manner, without being obtrusive or patronising."
375,There isn't close by parking near The Garage nightclub so would probably suggest taking a taxi to avoid a long walk to the club. 
376,This is a friendly cafe within Forres Community Centre with easy access for wheelchair users. Good quality food and drink (nice coffee!). The public library is in the same building with all the usual services on hand. A lot of care has been put into making this a good spot for all abilities. Definitely worth return visits - maybe for their Afternoon Tea package!
377,"The accessible bathroom wet rooms with level access and disabled toilets are again well sized, have grab rails on either side of the toilet and by the sink, and have sinks which are easy to get under in a wheelchair."
378,You can access the pub from the side entrance and there is a bar and a disabled toilet that everyone can access. 
379,Friendly and showed us a map. I think we could have navigated the one room without the pre talk on how to see the exhibits.
380,A wheelchair accessible ferry trip from Aberdeen to Lerwick during storm Brian. Great facilities and excellent staff who were always willing to help and very friendly. 
381,My single room had a separate toilet and shower with a sink in the room. Close to reception they have a disabled toilet.
382,"The venue is in the middle of town so there are many transport options. Bus, train, car, taxi or subway! However there are little to no parking spaces outside the venue. If you are lucky enough to find a space close by you may have to cross the many busy roads. The closest train stations are Glasgow Central which is a six minute walk, Glasgow Queen Street five minute walk and a short six minute walk from Buchanan Bus station. Overall okay to travel too."
383,Always receive a very warm welcome
384,"If you are in London and want to enjoy some art then visit the RA or Art as it is a great venue with some impressive art collections. The website has detailed Information on access, how to get there and facilities available. Discounted rates are available  (e.g just £10 plus carer free to see the current Painting the modern garden exhibition -  Monet, Matisse) etc). It does however, get very crowded and in a wheelchair it is hard to both get around the building and see the exhibits unless people are prepared to make space for you. Today I visited in a manual wheelchair but I normally go in my powerchair which enables me to see the paintings more easily. Restaurants and Cafes are accessible but get very crowded. Gallery cafe is currently closed which makes it even more difficult. Gallery does run some special tours between 9 -11 am for wheelchair users to certain exhibition so check the website and prebook if you are able to get there by 9 !"
385,"On Street parking with  a single yellow line, but pretty limited space"
386,"My family and I went on holiday to Washington DC. We stayed at the Watergate hotel. It was expensive but it was worth it as had everything we needed and more.   The hotel was wheelchair accessible including the rooftop bar which could be accessed using the lift. There was also a swimming pool which had a chair that enabled people with mobility issues to get into the pool (see photos).  We booked a double room and a king suite that had an interconnecting doors (see photos). The king suite had a wet floor en-suite bathroom. In it was a shower which had a flip down bench to sit and wash on. Alternatively if you cannot transfer onto the bench or stand up there is enough room to for a shower wheelchair (see photos). The mattresses were very soft which made moving and handling tricky.  The hotel restaurant was accessible and the food tasted great. In the morning the breakfast staff were happy for a member of my family to bring me back a selection of breakfast goodies which I could then eat in my bed.   The location of the hotel was perfect for us. Away from the busy inner city noise and traffic but still close enough to visit the city sights etc. The metro station foggy bottom is a short distance away from the hotel which made it relatively easy to explore the city centre. Being on the edge of the city encouraged us to hire a wheelchair accessible car (see photo) and travel to Arlington cemetery, mount Vernon and Alexandria. We also made use of the car to visit a retail outlet centre 😀. The hotel has underground parking for guests so we didn’t have to worry about parking.  I would definitely recommend this hotel."
387,"Great - very easy to access, with no steps and an easily accessible toilet.  The only thing to improve would be an automatic front door for wheelchair users, and dedicated disabled parking."
388,No problem with the loo itself but it is reached via a step. No ramp. Plenty of room inside.
389,There is no disabled toilets
390,"I travel by train to Newcastle Central station, then have used both the bus from Eldon Square and on this occasion by the Metro to Bank Foot. Both work well with Bank Foot having the advantage after the game of being quieter and before the busier Kingston Park platform. Central Station platform is now a level entry for wheelchair users with the platform having been raised."
391,"Accessibility had been thought of at the 3 venues.  The pub at the 2nd venue (The Boat Imn) was accessible - however, there were signage problems for the accessible toilets on the day I visited - temporary, I was assured. It was a little tight, however, manoeuvering my powerchair in the large gift shop."
392,Downstairs bathroom has a hoist and accessible shower for wheelchair users. 
393,"York St. John Students' Union is a light an airy building. Staff are welcoming and friendly. I was approached by a member of staff and asked if they could offer any help. Downstairs there is a bar serving a limited range of alcoholic and soft drinks (I found the choice quite restrictive). Upstairs there is a cafe run by Starbucks, serving hot drinks and cakes in a relaxed atmosphere. "
394,This Subway is right on the corner of St Anne's Road West and is in the same style and offers the same range of products you might expect from this well known chain.  There are around 10 or 11 tables in  venue all of the chairs are dinning room style chairs there are 4 small arm chairs  as well but these are very low. 
395,A disabled toilet with grab rails but no pull cord
396,"The path around Kielder reservoir is 26 miles of wide, disability accessible paths. This is a multi-use path for many users, except for cars, making it very safe to navigate and plenty of room for everyone. There are a few different places to eat around the lake (including The Calvert Trust – an outdoor activities centre disabled people), all hosting car parks making it possible to pick a section of the path you would like to explore or travel around the whole route. There is also a wheelchair friendly, passenger ferry situated at two points around the reservoir which sails from shore to shore.  There is a sculpture trail around the route; however some of these are not accessible due to uneven paths leading off the main trail. Everything is well signposted the whole way around.  The downsides are a few steep hills which aren’t impossible but are possibly more difficult to push wheelchairs up. Also, the north shore has no points of contact from Kielder down to the dam wall (12 miles)."
397,"My powerchair does not fit into the theatre itself  and the area in front of the doors is not ideal. Staff are friendly and helpful but I was particularly put off by a previous visit. The noise during the production was horrendous (I am not exaggerating), unnecessarily loud which spoilt my night out. My recent visit to the cafe was quick, because the new area was not my cup of tea. There were easily accessible toilets but as usual you have to give way to the baby changing equipment which makes it hard work with a Puma 40.  Worth checking out the production and there is a small lift and disabled toilets (getting in requires some fancy work with the chair)."
398,No steps at all.  Good size print in cottage information folder. 
399,"The Crick Institute undertakes scientific research about health and disease. It's the largest biomedical (relating to both biology and medicine) research institute in Europe. It's a working building and while its laboratories are not open to the public, there are public areas where fascinating exhibitions and regular events are held. It's engaging and similar in style to what is on offer at the Wellcome Collection. It's housed in a very striking contemporary step free building, which is impressive and well worth visiting for the architecture alone. "
400,There were two accessible toilets at the ticket office and access was great; there was a red cord within reach and grab bars and it was lovely and clean.  There were no disabled toilets on the boat itself.
401,"Friendly and helpful staff. Carers go in free, plus all free for English Heritage members."
402,"This is a pet shop we have started to use in addition to our regular one which is further away. This independent pet shop knows their market and who they provide for and keep things simple. They are located on the northbound side of Barclay / Bruntsfield Terrace over looking Links. There is ample parking an a plentiful choice of bus services, In either direction the bus stops are no more than 40m from the shop, the 11,15,16,23,36 and 45 services all stop here.there are buses every 5 to 6 minutes. Both brothers the owners, are very knowledgeable about small animals, birds, cats and dogs and have a wealth of networking experience. The shop is small, busy and congested but not cluttered, it would be very tight for a wheelchair, there is a wandering cat in the shop and they also deliver. They have a tidy, little web site and they take delivery orders by phone or mail."
403,"This quirky little shop is actually three different businesses in one space: The Edinburgh Bow Tie Co., diedododa, and Etch’d.  "
404,"2 accessible loos at bus stance entrance along a narrow corridor. Signage only at one end of centre pointing to where they are. I was intercepted by a member of staff who advised that the first disabled toilet was not big enough for a wheelchair and guided me to the further away toilet which was clean & roomy, plenty of grab rails and assistance cord. I left a Euan’s Guide red cord card, as cord tied up. Radar key system in place to access loo"
405,You may have to ask someone to alert the staff to come to the door if it's closed which it might be in the winter.  There is only a temporary ramp which the staff have to put in place and this is quite steep but manageable.  The staff (and customers) were all very happy to help with this and were very helpful and welcoming. The interior of the cafe is also very accessible with room to manoeuvre between tables etc.
406,Incredibly helpful and really seemed to care. 
407,Overall access rating very low because of the toilet and staff situation - see below.
408,"Visiting offices can often be a bit tricky as a wheelchair user. Barclays broke the mold with easy access, a warm welcome, and responsive staff."
409,We went by WAV and parked on a street nearby. Pavements all good with dropped curbs and quite a lot of pedestrianised in the centre. There are three spaces outside the museum but suspect they are often full. Fifty yards down the road (away from town centre) is a good sized level access pay and display car park. 
410,"The bathroom was spacious and accessed using a radar key, but lacks a full changing station."
411,good and helpful
412,"I'm not sure where the nearest parking is as City Square is pedestrianised, but the main bus stops are a short walk away. "
413,"A good bus service runs close by with the nearest stop being approx 5 min walk away. As this is right in the centre of town, parking, even with a blue badge will be difficult."
414,An excellent meal in a recently refurbished restaurant.  The tables could have been a bit further apart but we managed to get my large wheelchair in without too much problem.  The welcome was friendly and the service prompt.  The menu was good with enough choice to meet most peoples needs.  Prices offer excellent value for money.  
415,See above
416,"Being in the centre, with work going on around St Andrews square, dedicated disabled spaces are not in use at the moment.  Handy for buses and trains which are 2 minutes away on princes street."
417,"The disabled access is ramped, very accessible for every type of wheelchair"
418,Excellent. Flat access throughout. All great.
419,"Disabled toilets are nice and roomy hubby says and in all toilets you can hear a pre-recorded shipping forecast, which is very amusing to listen too"
420,Not a changing place toilet but big wetroom. Shower seat too small only criticism.
421,Designated disabled parking spaces if you have a blue badge. There is a parking fee. There is also a drop-off point which has a dropped kerb. All the carpark is on an even level.
422,Always friendly and helpful.
423,"Shopper's Parking at Craigleith Retail Park. Can't comment on the parking in Davidson's Mains. Craigleith Retail Park is served by Lothian Bus 38 from the Royal Infirmary via the south side and Balgreen (not at weekends, when you need to alight at the Holiday Inn - see below) . Lothian Buses 41, 42 & 43 connect the city centre with Queensferry Road - get off at the Holiday Inn and you'll be close to the start of the walk, which is just down South Groathill Avenue. From Davidson's Mains Lothian Buses 41 & 42 go back to the city centre."
424,"Visitor's Centre with  café serving hot and cold drinks, soup and sandwiches and cakes.   Disabled access.  Outdoor activity Centre including Disabled sailing Centre.  Bike hire,  3 wheelers available.   Country walks and natural wildlife.  Lots of swans and ducks to feed. Contact centre for further information.   01505 842882 or check the website clydemuirsiel.co.uk"
425,A superb self catering cottage for wheelchair users. The owners were very friendly and helpful and a lot of thought as gone in to provide a lovely cottage for people with limited mobility.
426,"Great library, helpful staff, spacious and easy to navigate."
427,"There are designated parking spaces close to the building, which has a level entrance. "
428,We drove and parked in the normal carpark
429,"There is a dedicated Blue Badge car park. A special bus service, the number 98 runs from St Andrew Square in the city centre out to the show and is wheelchair accessible"
430,The disabled loo at the new Gloucester Services on the M5 is amazing - sorry no pictures but try it for yourself!  Masses of space and top notch facilities
431,"Good on-site parking, big enough to park and turn a minibus."
432,"If you present yourself as a wheelchair user there are staff at every key point to get you in via an accessible route. THe only thing we couldn't do is the Spirit of London experience, some kind of ride in a mock taxi for which you had to be able to walk. Everything else could be done. "
433,The one thing that let the Dormy House down was signage! When you get to the main entrance you are confronted by about 5 or 6 steps. We asked a member of staff and they directed us along the side and around the back. This is easily accessible for a wheelchair user but they need to tell people! When you get to the back of the Dormy house you go up a short ramp and in some double doors - there is a slight lip but that didn't cause us any issues. There are plenty of tables available on this level - although if you want to sit by the window there are a couple of steps down to those tables.
434,There is masses of disabled parking outside the main entrance.  This is one of the few services locations I have seen where the arriving/departing traffic is not a hazard for those who have to load or unload a wheelchair
435,Good for the age of the building
436,"The Armitt Musuem was founded to celebrate the heritage of Ambleside. It contains so much information inside such a small building, I was shocked by how much history I soaked up on a short visit. Beatrix Potter is now my favourite historical hero and before my visit I knew nothing about her life.  The entry fee is £5 per person, which is not made clear on any signage and you are only told once you try to move from the gift shop into the museum. I was a little taken aback as I had assumed it was free and I was also told sternly ""no photos!"" when I took my phone out to check the time.  We went through the double doors into the museum and started reading the wall features and looking the items on display. I didn't realise until after a few blocks of texts that we were actually moving around the small museum in the wrong direction and I was reading about Beatrix Potters life in reverse. It wasn't clear to myself or my carer where we should have started reading.  In any case it was so interesting and it is nice that this history has been preserved. I feel like the knowledge I gained was worth the entry fee. There wouldn't be much to do for children or people who can't or don't enjoy reading as the display is extremely text heavy and more like you have stepped into a book. It's not interactive in any way. It's very bright, white and orderly.  There is a library upstairs which I thought would be interesting to see. We used the wheelchair lift which was easy to use and the staff showed us how to use it safely. I was surprised that so much care had been taken to make the building as accessible as possible and was really happy that I could visit the library. The library is a collection of older books and you can look at as many as you want. I think I should have made a day trip out of this as book preservation really interests me but I didn't have time to look around.  The volunteers do have two friendly little dogs who run around and greet you uostairs so if you are afraid of small dogs or have an allergy I would bear this in mind too.  Overall it was a great place to visit.  "
437,Large car park.  Bus stop nearby.
438,For a gardens built on some pretty uneven ground the access was good.
439,Andy & Niki were really helpful in every way.
440,Was really pleased to get a dedicated disabled space in the middle of a row and a few rows back so we didn't have to sit right at the front!  Only disappointment was that the disabled toilet was a bit tight because of the door opening inwards.
441,"The staff were all exceptional. They were all aware of what assistance I needed, thanks to the Welcome App. "
442,"As the building attracts many visitors per day I thought there should be more disabled toilets. However the toilets provided were large enough to maneuver a wheelchair and for a carer and service user can both move around easily, grab rails were also provided. "
443,What a pleasure to be able to report on a perfectly designed and laid-out accessible toilet! Full marks!
444,Access for me as a power wheelchair user was first class. If there were steps you had a ramp or a lift to get me where we wanted to go. Plenty of signage so we always knew where we were going.
445,"Lots of them, knowledgable and happy to help explain displays."
446,The access is not wheelchair friendly and as it's a step could be awkward for other disabilities 
447,The accessible all areas
448,2 radar key toilets. Not the best of condition
449,"Wheelchairs are taken from a reception centre, located in the station, to the train, and are boarded and placed by SNCF staff. They must be there 30 minutes before departure. Upon arrival, the same procedure applies in reverse."
450,"There is parking at the back of the venue on the right hand side. To get there take the lane just before the Hall.   Public transport is pretty tricky, I think there are low level buses that travel through Crail  but I'm not sure how frequent they are."
451,A modern city so lots of well paved areas without kerbs. 
452,All the staff were really helpful & friendly & could not have done any more to help.
453,Had a commode but plenty of room in wet room
454,Very helpful.
455,"If you have any difficulty (it is unlikely as doors are not heavy) then staff at the reception open the door for you. On the ground floor (all floors are level) is an accessible toilet, a number of tables and seats and a restaurant/cafe. There are three rather large lifts to use to get upstairs to your room."
456,"Do not go here.  Especially not alone. There is absolutely nothing for the the disabled. Zero. The streets are cobble stones, entrances have high steps and except for modern buildings, lifts or elevators are hard to come by although some older buildings did install them. For example to reach the Senior Faculty Lounge at Balliol College (a modern room) there are tons of stairs. To see a Shakespearean Play at Merton College, there are uneven ancient steps galore. Its and beautiful city with friendly people and busdrivers but very little for challenged people. N"
457,The initial inside areas ~ the visitor centre~ is well laid out and accessible.
458,Nikki welcomed us. Staff on hand to help out . Willing to let disabled customers be seen at the rear of the bank instead of going upstairs. All staff said hello.
459,Very accessible.  Centre has a hearing loop system and is guide dog friendly.  Well signposted.  Plenty of spaces to rest or catch your breath.
460,Plenty of disabled parking spaces close to entrance at Napier Street.   Also disabled spaces at entrance at Collier St with walkway over River and lift down to access.  Johnstone train station a good 15 minute walk.  No 38 b bus stops at Houston Square 5 minite walk via Collier street.
461,"All areas accessible with a wheelchair.  My son who is disabled was made to feel incredibly welcome.  Wheelchair users get into the park for free, and there is a queue assist pass available for those who have difficulty queuing. The rides for young children in Peppa Pig world are big enough for adults to go on too.  We have visited other parks where small children have to go on small rides by themselves which isn't ideal for my son as he lacks coordination and is partially sighted.  At Paulton's Park he could go on all the rides that he wanted to as we could go on with him."
462,There was a good size accessible toilet with grab rails it was very clean and the lighting is good and will come on as you enter the toilet.  The Toilet is on the ground floor level area past the café and is on the left hand side as you go towards the toilet  The only issue was that the red cord was short and by about 2 feet from the floor a Red cord card is in place 
463,Can't comment on parking. Köpenick S-bahn station (accessible) is 1.8 km from the historic centre. The S-bahn station at Spindlersfeld (line S47) is just under 1km & is also accessible. From there it's a level wheel/walk to the Already (apart from the slope up to the bridge) or Tram 61 or Tram 63 to Schlossplatz.
464,Toilets are in the main chapel. Roomy with good circulation and transfer space but I have taken off a star as although there is the usual wide door one has to go through a standard width door to get to it. Sink has been boxed in thus limiting access for a chair user. 
465,"If you arrive early, you have every chance of taking the only disabled bay here. Then your carer will need to go inside to arrange for staff to place a ramp down to get you up a step into the hotel. "
466,Fopp as a chain sometimes tends to be cluttered with some stock on the floor but this shop wasn't too bad and the aisles where wider than normal.
467,"The Trafford Centre is a shopping centre for everyone, making for an excellent day out. It includes a variety of shops, with a wide range brands. The food court contains many different well known eat-in and take-out services. It's large in size with 2 floors of shops and 2 floors separate in the food hall. It being a main shopping centre, it's guaranteed to get busy."
468,I used the ordinary toilets but the accessible toilet was next to it.
469,"There are not enough accessible toilets. They are ridiculously over-subscribed, and they are often disgustingly messy, with wet floor and bits of wet bogroll scattered around. Ugh. The red emergency cords do not all have the usual triangular plastic attachment, so they are very hard to grab hold of in an emergency, and they're often tied up out of reach. See my attached pics. The cleaners' activity/inspection logs on the toilet walls are often left unsigned/uninitialled for a whole week."
470,The scooter was outside ready for us. The cafe has ramped access with rails
471,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
472,"Level, but a pull door to get into shop, easy enough for carer to open for you."
473,"The disabled toilets are located within the normal visitor toilets, however, due to the layout, you may require assistance with the doors"
474,Available in the Gallery and the Academy.
475,Didn't really meet many staff.  Those at entry & cafe friendly.
476,"The café is about a mile from the train station, & car parking nearby is limited. However, taxis drop clientele off directly outside the café, & there are several bus stops nearby. The pavements are in places uneven, with some of the kerbs being rather steep to get up & down, but there are proper crossings on the main road if not on the side streets."
477,Very helpful
478,Friendly and accommodative
479,"Fantastic temporary build to enjoy gin and whiskey tasting experiences, accessible for wheelchair users."
480,"Whole place is on the flat,wide paths and doorways suitable for wheelchairs, buggies, electric buggies etv"
481,Step-free entrance but the bookshop is so cramped that it's very difficult to get around it in a wheelchair.
482,"All disabled rooms on ground floor.NO lift.All ground floor,connecting Pub and car park level---NO STEPS."
483,Polite and helpful. Weren't astonished to see a disabled person paying for things!
484,A typically modern multiplex with good facilities (for the disabled).
485,"There are three lodges on site. The three bedroom one we stayed in, Hideaway, was described on the website as wheelchair friendly. However the size and layout is such that it's difficult to get into the bedroom, round doors etc. My husband and son had to move the bed so I could even get into the bedroom. The ensuite bathroom is a wet room but the door to it is behind the door into the bedroom so needs many manoeuvres to get to it. There are few handrails, none by the loo and basin. The shower seat provided was not height adjustable and so low I couldn't transfer unaided. There was so much furniture in the living room, I had to sit away from my family."
486,Well catered for with ready access to the one from the master bedroom.
487,"Never saw any staff, even when we needed them."
488,"You can use the loo at the climb centre or at one of the friendly cafes opposite, but no loo available in shop I'm afraid."
489,"Just off the main thoroughfare of the concourse there are toilets. Immediately before the payment barrier is an accessible toilet. It has a RADAR lock, with a wide and easy to use door. Once inside there was plenty of space to manoeuvre my powerchair. It was clean and well kept."
490,Reception staff were unhelpful when I approached them saying I had reserved a wheelchair as I was walking with my cane and showing my invisible disability. Once in the wheelchair attitudes changed and the cafe staff were particularly helpful.
491,The staff members at the Centraal Museum are very helpful and accommodating and can assist you when needed.
492,After not turning up to do the job we made attempts to calll both of the men runningbthe project which were never answered.  I had a hole dug across my lawn for a drainage and has now left thr garden unusable for my chair.
493,Helpful
494,Visit to the supermarket during COVID restrictions - social distancing was in place.
495,Staff really efficient and attentive 
496,"I was glad and sorry that my carer was with me, I would not to have liked to have attempted the main ramp from under the grandstand to the seating platform myself and the stewards were not the quickest to offer assistance, we were led by a steward straight to our seats and were able to find the toilets which were 20 yards under the grandstand. we were within touching distance of the acts, and had a fantastic view of all the action, the fireworks, the projection show on the castle and the narration all the way through kept us up to date with what acts were coming on and where they were from. I am unaware if there was a braille version of the event programme."
497,Extremely helpful and polite. 
498,Fast and helpful
499,CG 2014 venues have no on-site parking. However for general use distance is perhaps challenging.
500,Very friendly and sincere. If we had any problems they are a stones throw away.
501,"One entrance is easy to access, the atmosphere of the outside areas were good.  Difficult in getting a parking space."
502,Baumwipfelpfad Schwarzwald is a wheelchair accessible elevated walkway in the Black Forest culminating in a spiral tower with an (optional) slide back down the middle. It's a very enjoyable and unique way to experience the forest.
503,Step free access to all areas on various terrains but mostly flat. There is a slope up through the rockery which might be tough in a manual chair but worth it to view the waterfall areas. I had no problem in my powerchair.  There are good spaces in the cafe and restaurant with reserved priority seating for wheelchair users.  Tables have a high clearance to get under.  There is both a ramp and lift to the upper level in the glass house. The pond area  has no barrier before the path slopes into the water which might be an issue for visually impaired visitors. There are seats to rest on all around the gardens. The cafe has gluten free food.
504," Fusciardi's is on the sea front, a short walk from the Pier. There are local buses that stop nearby."
505,Particularly helpful
506,This was our third visit and still think it's pretty amazing. The accommodation is really well thought out and everything has been supplied for your needs and comfort. The extremely friendly Kim and her team can supply any extra aids you might require. A s the weather was lovely we had a family party in the beautiful garden and patio and always enjoy the relaxed atmosphere. Do check out the website and look at the photos of the houses -you will be impressed! Lots of helpful tourist info brochures and even games and puzzles in the hideaway coffee table.  Don't think anyone would leave disappointed.
507,If you want to help or even if your starting up a Vouluntry group they can help 
508,"Alert, friendly and very helpful. We felt welcomed."
509,"The Elephant coffee has one unisex disabled toilet for customers. The door opens out into the café, making access easier. There is a large space within the toilet with transfer rails which can be moved out of the way, and grab rails. The toilet is taller than the basic, making it easier for transfers, whilst the sink is lower and accessible for someone in a wheelchair. There is an alarm for assistance if required in the toilet cubicle."
510,"Short visit during when social distancing measures where in place. This store has good parking facilities, bus links and I find it to be spacious for myself in a wheelchair."
511,Ollie was super nice and helpful
512,"When purchasing tickets online there was a option to buy a free carer ticket without ringing up a special number which was really good and rare as it's normally a faff.  Last year we went we were literally the only people in the accessible campsite - it was a huge ground with two portable loos.  This year there was about 10 tents and 3 portable loos - 2 that were really wheelchair accessible. It would had been good that if the accessible campsite had a sign. I also liked the way they published set times and a map before everyone arrived online.   Though this year there was no confusion of where we got our waistbands - though I did have to go and ask somebody at the gate.   I'll be honest and say I had a baby wipe bath as the showers only had cold water and from what I could see there was no accessible showers.  The arena itself was good but could be improved. The accessible seating area at the main stage was not used, only by toddlers as a play thing, it was only raised by about 20cm and it would pretty much had been impossible to see the stage - but the thought was there.  The whole site was pretty much accessible but at night it got really dark and cold, some lights would had been good.  The craft beer bar was brilliant, a great selection and never too busy, I've never been to a music festival when the bar was empty when the main act was on!  It's not a busy festival, theres a feeling of it always being half empty but it seems more relaxed and friendly. "
513,The bunkhouse is large and spacious and easy to get around in a wheelchair
514,On street parking is available outside and there are many side streets also with free parking! 
515,"This is a unique museum where you can learn about the history of witches in the 16th and 17th century, and the weigh test given to those accused of witchcraft.   While visiting this museum, you can undergo the weigh test yourself.  If you pass, you will receive a certificate as proof to your friends and family that you are not a witch.   The overall rating is a bit lower, because not all parts of the museum are wheelchair accessible."
516,"Amazing kind, helpful, friendly staff!"
517,We didn't use them but there are accessible toilets. Braehead shopping centre does also have a changing places toilet.. Which is why I've given it a high score
518,I didn't expect to be able to travel on the Thames River Bus as water and wheelchairs usually don't mix well together! It was great to find I could get on board with my powerchair.
519,"Although I did not use them, there were 2 accessible toilets close by. They were clean & spacious with handlebars & an emergency cord. It appeared that the stewards were controlling access to these toilets."
520,There is adequate disabled parking spaces in the Council car parks which are withing easy distance of the market.  All routes to the market have dropped kerbs.
521,There is a pay & display right next to it. 
522,"Personally for me its a 20 minute walk from Tweedbank, the last stop on the new Boarders Railway line (roughly a 1h 20m ride from Waverly). Who doesn't love a railway journey and it has opened up the boarders to those without a car. The buses in the area are great, going to Abbotsford House and Melrose town (about a 10 minute bus ride). "
523,Large car-park with six disabled parking spaces near the entrance.   Bus stop near by front of building but don't know how regular buses are.
524,"Wembley Stadium, the home of English football, is an iconic sports venue, which also hosts concerts and other events. On our last visit we found a welcoming atmosphere for wheelchair users."
525,Dedicated space right in front of the lodge with others close by.
526,"Again, excellent."
527,"When we recently visited the Giant's Causeway, an alarm in the visitors' centre accessible toilet had been activated. A member of staff carefully knocked on the door, then let himself in. The room was vacant, so he deactivated the alarm, and then tied the emergency cord neatly out of the way so it wouldn't be accidentally pulled again.  The facilities appear to be excellent, but they can't be used properly if staff don't know how to maintain them.  The room wasn't particularly large, so I don't think it would be much use to anyone in a motorised chair, and might be a struggle for someone using smaller mobility aids.  I didn't see a Changing Places style accessible bathroom, but my party didn't need one so I wasn't particularly looking."
528,Arrived by car from Rosslare ferry terminal. Disabled parking bay directly outside main entrance of hotel 
529,"Full wheelchair accessible accommodation with friendly staff. 24 hour nursing care is also available and volunteer help on a one-to-one basis for washing, toileting and bathing facilities. Ensuite facilities in each bedroom. Full-board is provided. Daily trips organised to places of interest within the North-West area, taken out on adapted buses with lifts for the guests. Gives the opportunity for disabled people and people with disabilities to mix with able bodied volunteers from all walks of life and from other European countries also. Individuals are also taken out into the Southport seaside resort to enjoy the likes of shopping, eating out in various accessible restaurants and pubs and the town's amusements. People with varying disabilities are accommodated for at Sandpipers. The Sandpipers centre is based on the dunes facing the largest in land man-made lake in Great Britain. "
530,See photo.  The disabled toilet is small and it is almost impossible to close the door  behind you  when entering in a wheelchair. There is also not enough room for a carer  to help.
531,Only one and was locked. Couldn't find anyone to open it for me.
532,Very helpful.
533,"Great ferry which I used for my trip to Lerwick, Shetland. Great accessible restaurant and bar. Amazing staff, can't speak highly enough of them"
534,"Large parking area, big enough for bus'es etc.  Good access from main road."
535,There was plenty of disabled parking. 
536,The Eagle has level access to get in through the side door and the door is very wide to get through. Inside is very spacious however there aren’t that many tables so on a busy night you might struggle.
537,"We found parking quite easy, I would have thought though that on busy days there would not be enough disabled parking for everyone."
538,Wonderful! Healthcare but not as you know it... Will be 5* when the bus stop is back after current building work finished...
539,"This cinema is located in Broad Street Plaza in the centre of Halifax. It is wheelchair accessible due to the lifts which go up to the main floor of the cinema where you can buy your cinema tickets and treats to eat whilst watching the film. The staff are always friendly and willing to assist. There is a car park next to the cinema, which unfortunately isn’t free, it has disabled parking spots and lifts from the car park down to the plaza, where the entrance to the cinema can be located. If you do not have a car, the cinema is in the centre of the town and is located less than five minutes away the bus station. "
540,"Although no actual disabled bays all area is close to hotel entrance, and easy enough to get into reception area.  "
541,Around the hotel and restaurant is good. The rooms are ok but only one has a wetroom which is a shame.
542,"Most staff first class, but activity and leisure staff were lacklustre"
543,"Hotel Entrance: The path and streets outside the hotel are extremely smooth and clean as well as kerb cuts. The main entrance is completely wheelchair accessible and all level with no steps. There are automatic doors into the hotel and reception area.   Reception/Lobby: There was lots of space to move around in my wheelchair. Unfortunately there wasn't a lowered check-in desk. Guests check themselves in by using the self-check in tablets. The buffet breakfast area is spacious and there is a range of tables and chairs with a lovely green garden that you can sit out in, which is also accessible.   Room: Our accessible room had twin beds and although the room was lovely and modern, it was slightly on the small side. The beds were incredibly comfortable though - BEST bed I've slept in while away from home. Although the room was small, I was still able to move around in my wheelchair, but it was tighter than I'd like from an accessible room. I loved the modern features though."
544,Plenty of room
545,The accessible loo is a good one with it being large and clean. The only downside is that it is accessed by way of a lift from street level down to the basement. The lift was out of order and the staff said it had been like this for more than a month. 
546,"Access all around the exhibition space, cafe and toilets is very good. The museum is low light throughput bear this in mind re sight impairments. There is an audio guide available. €10 admission, over 65 half price. Careers get in free. "
547,"I was late coming to opera, which opened up for me with the provision of surtitles, where the words sung in their original language are translated into English and projected onto a screen above the stage so they can be easily read.  My carer and I had gone to see an opera in 2016 that I was thoroughly enjoying, until just after the Interval.  The staff had expressed themselves unhappy about me sitting on my rollator seat in the allotted wheelchair space, in case the view of the person behind was blocked, although nobody complained.  So they let me use the theatre's wheelchair, which proved lovely and comfortable, and also proved not to belong to the theatre.  It was taken from me shortly after the Interval, not only upsetting me but distracting me from the opera itself.  Then the surtitles failed.  My disabilities are such, this, combined with the distress I had already been made to feel, left me confused and I could not get back into the story.  In frustration, I E-mailed Venue Cymru to request a refund.  This was initially denied, but I was eventually offered tickets for a performance of Othello (as an opera) later that year.  However, it transpired I was given a wrong performance date, and couldn't go as a result.  This involved me in yet more effort but the matter was eventually sorted and I and a different companion got tickets to see Le Vin Herbe, a re-telling of the Tristan legend.  We attended the 4th April 2017 performance - and nothing went wrong.  I have a Hynt card issued by the Welsh government that allows me to take a carer along free of charge and the Welsh National Opera are really good.  However, although I keep thinking about booking for another production, the difficulties as described above were off-putting."
548,"In the Lochalsh area, close to the famous Glenelg turntable ferry, is Glenelg village and its amazing Community Hall. After a long cycle ride from Kyleakin and facing another long ride back, we were thrilled to find a café open in this hall. While that was all lovely and quite 'normal' for rural Scotland, what is wonderful about this venue is the accessibility. Around the back of the hall are the very accessible toilets AND two disabled parking spaces right there. Who knew? Visit if you are within any reasonable distance and do head down to see the famous ferry, with its attendant seals, porpoises and otters. "
549,Fully accessible bungalows.   If there was any additional access requirement the owners strive to accommodate.
550,Accessed from outside by double doors. Very easy to move around the bar and restaurant. Doors to the corridors leading to the rooms are opened with a card - a bit tricky to get through with a wheelchair. Lots of help to hold the door from other guests. The door to the room is heavy and could do with a hook to hold it open for a wheelchair.
551,Jane who works at Art of Beauty is very friendly and I always have a nice catch-up. Always feel welcome.
552,Staff are excellent and have provided me with assistance over and above the norm. All have receive d & I training.
553,"bit of a hike/wheel, near bus station and train station"
554,disabled ramp easy to get into  lots of space in lobby automatic doors could be better signpost in the shopping centre
555,All we meet or dealt with were pleasant enough.
556,"Disabled people can get around the stadium perfectly fine. However, signage around the grounds could be better - I only know where I am going as I'm a season ticket holder. There are plenty of approachable staff though. There is nothing that would discourage me from attending."
557,"Although there is an outside  plant area as well as indoor plants & garden sundries, this is a really good place for buying good quality gifts, kitchen ware, good quality foods & so on. Two excellent cafes; Theatre Cafe on the ground floor & the Tree Tops Cafe on the lift accessible first floor.  Very disabled friendly, with no steps. Plenty of Blue Badge parking by the main entrance, with plenty of aisle space  "
558,When interacting with staff members they were very friendly. When I asked for a straw and side plate they brought them straight away. 
559,Road is single track but minibus wide with plenty of passing space. Would benefit from more signage as it's a long way up hill off the main road. There are speed ramps but they are not severe. Everything is wheelchair accessible. Hoists available. Changing rooms space. Plenty of seating. All tarmac paths. Ramped access where needed to hydrotherapy pool. 
560,There are so many animals to see and there are lots of activities for younger children. It is a fair price and  the food is great. Me and my family will definitely be going again during the summer holidays.
561,"I stayed at Revitalise with my 74 year old Mum who is an amputee & wheelchair user. Netley Waterside House offers holidays to people with a wide range of abilities & their carers. The staff & volunteers work hard to deliver the best possible experience. Trips are available to places such as museums and shopping centres. There is live entertainment every evening and a range of activities throughout the day. Dietary requirements are met & there is a licenced bar. Carers & nursing staff ensure that everyone gets a break. Due to her disability my Mum has been unable to use a bath for 15 years, but thanks to the incredible ""Parker Bath"", she was able to enjoy a long soak with bubble jets. Waterside house is in a beautiful location, with stunning views of the water. A lot of thought has gone into providing the best possible experience."
562,There's a good accessible loo. It may be a little tight for some powerchair users. It is kept locked but the key is available from the staff.
563,The PEAK staff were good and the curling instructors were fantastic! 
564,It was easy to get everywhere - there is a lift
565,"I telephoned the centre the day before and was given very clear and relevant information, and felt welcomed even before we arrived!"
566,"The staff I met were friendly and helpful, BUT they thought the obstructions by the tills, mentioned above, were trivial and even amusing. They did not try to remove the obstructions, and they certainly didn't take them seriously. This is a very bad mark against the Robert Dyas chain."
567,The store is in the town centre and has some on street parking nearby. Car parks are not far away with level paved access.
568,"Public transport is pretty great with Lothian buses 7, 14, 21 stopping outside and a 10 around the corner. I think you can get a taxi up to the gates. I am not sure about private parking or blue badges."
569,"The toilet in subway is a large disabled friendly toilet, however, the location of the toilet is in a very badly designed area as the door opens outwards into the area individuals stand to queue and order food. To use the toilet, staff need to be asked to unlocked the door. "
570,"There is free parking, disabled bays and wheelchair accessible buses to and from the arena, outside the main entrance.  There are no parking bays close to main doors. There is a lowered car park payment machine too.  "
571,"Lifts connect upper to lower levels, these are accessed from the end platforms on the upper level, and are usually working although it might be good to check before you travel as otherwise there are a lot of stairs."
572,The staff were helpfull to help with directions and made sure I understood 
573,No steps anywhere. All doors wide enough for wheelchairs (we did not use one).
574,"Travelling around the Highlands in winter, I was amazed to find that this tea room was open! Everywhere else seemed to be shut for the season. The cafe is tiny, but it has put thought into accessibility with a ramp, accessible parking spaces and an accessible toilet."
575,We didn’t check out the accessible loo on the landing near the Brasserie. The one in our en-suite bathroom was well-equipped with grab rails and not too high. There was adequate space to manoeuvre and an adjacent accessible wash hand basin at a sensible level for a wheelchair user.
576,Great place to go for brunch. Friendly staff. Step free access and easy to manoeuvre around.
577,extremely helpful especially a lady called Phyliss
578,"We entered directly from High Street Kensington and it was step free. There is also an entrance from Holland Park, but I didn't use that.   On the concourse on the way to the museum entrance look at the pavement, as the names of the Commonwealth countries are dotted about, as a reminder tot he building previously being the Commonwealth Institute. Also on the way to the entrance you will pass a separate museum shop, which is step free. There is also a water feature but the space is wide enough to avoid getting splashed and just outside the museum there is some bench seating, with most of it not having a supportive back rest.  There are 2 sets of automatic entrance doors and the ticket desk is immediately on your left when you enter. The Kubrick exhibition is immediately in front and is all on the ground floor with step free access. On the ground level there is also the shop, accessible toilet and a stepped seating area with no back support, which I was only able to access sitting on the front row.  I had looked on the website before I visited and saw that wheelchairs could be reserved, so I pre-booked this. I was asked to collect the manual wheelchair from the ticket desk and it was waiting for me on arrival. My experience with the wheelchair was rather unfortunate. After being in the exhibition about 10 minutes the left foot rest came out. My friend but it back in for me but it came out again about 10 minutes later and we were unable to fix it. I returned to the main entrance and explained to the member of staff what had happened and asked if I could return the wheelchair and have my crutch back, I had asked and they had looked after it while I had the wheelchair. The member of staff was unable to leave her location and had to radio another member of staff, who came quite quickly. However I had to wait a few minutes for my crutch to be returned and that was quite difficult as there was no where to sit. I re-entered the exhibition and continued with using my crutch.   While I was going round the exhibition in a wheelchair I observed that my legs were unable to fit under the display cabinets and this meant I had to view the objects in the case side on. Also the cabinets had black casing which added to the difficulty in viewing the objects, this could have been avoided if the cabinets were see-through. I'm only an occasional wheelchair users so not very competent in steering, but I found I often kept catching myself on the sharpness of the corners of the display cabinets. Where there was text this was often too small a font and too high up for me to read it clearly while I was a wheelchair user, also the contrast between the text and the background was hard to see due to the colour of the writing.   There was very limited seating in the exhibition as it was only in the areas that were showing film clips. They were small dark cinema style booths with a single bench seating with no back support. There are no subtitles for the video clips. The exhibition is fairly large, there's lots of things to see and we were there for over 2 hours, and also there were fold up stools available some additional firm seating areas, which make transfers easier would have been welcome.  I do not know if this exhibition was typical of the museum's other galleries, as the Kubrick exhibition has been traveling the world and I'm not sure how much is identical to what it would be like in other venues and how much had been adapted to fit in for the Design Museum. "
579,"Nice enough place for able bodied, but very difficult and restricted access for physically disabled. Lots of crazy paved paths, uneven levels and steps mean that many areas are out of reach to wheelchair and mobility scooter users. In fact I would only recommend if you have a ruggedised mobility scooter and even then areas like the kitchen garden will be out of reach. (Despite being mentioned in some reviews, there is no longer a tea room/cafe there)"
580,"Got the buses, Lothian buses I know off that go by, 7, 8, 14, 49."
581,"The park itself was fully wheelchair accessible apart from the shop, which had a step up to it and could have been easily ramped. The paths were made of gravel and were quite steep and challenging in many places, so if you go with a wheelchair I strongly suggest taking some kind of powered assistance or someone who can help you. There was also a golf buggy type vehicle where you could pay to have a guided tour, although we didn't use it.  One nice feature was that the fences had larger holes in places to fit a camera lens through so you could more easily take photos. These with at both standing and sitting height.  There were benches situated at various points round the paths."
582,All staff that I came across or spoke to seemed very friendly and helpful. 
583,The staff were friendly and helpful without being smothering. 
584,No parking on the site that I could see but there is parking on street and there are disabled bays nearby plus blue badge holders can park in residents only bays in Oxford.
585,Plenty of parking when we arrived. Street level access from the car park and automatic doors available to enter the building. Friendly staff who were keen to help and plenty of space to manoeuvre. Heavy doors to enter the cinema screen and some of the shows we had booked had only two wheelchair spaces per screen.   Unfortunately on busier shows some people had booked the seats around the wheelchair spaces without needing the wheelchair space itself which is not the fault of the cinema however I would recommend booking in advance because of this. I was able to book online and was sent an email to show on arrival via my phone screen so we did not have to queue at all.  My only issue would be the temperature in each screen. Perhaps this isn't as problematic when it's busier however I found it to be very cold on every visit.
586,There was on street parking close by and a large car park accessed by a flat smooth path. The bus station is not too far away. 
587,"No negative issues, signage perhaps could be expanded."
588,Very spacious and modern. Toilet A1
589,Very helpful!
590,"Only issues were that the monorail couldn't be accessed on a mobility scooter - wheelchairs are fine. Also, there are a couple of steep inclines. Might need an extra pair of hands."
591,"As far as the cinema goes, the washrooms smelled of methane or ammonia during all of my visits. The food was relatively poor quality and parts of the business (e.g. bar area) are worn and ugly by current standards."
592,"The SportScotland National Sport Training Centre Inverclyde. Largs, offers training facilities for both elite athletes and the general public. A £12m redevelopment has seen the centre undergo major changes, including the addition of accommodation with the capacity for 120 wheelchair users. As part of disabled access day 2019, I visited the centre as a Euan's Guide ambassador and goto try boccia and archery. The wheelchair access of the centre, whilst impressive in its accommodation and sports halls, has one or two areas that need some small improvements such as the gym and the accessible changing facilities."
593,Narrow ramp up to heavy outside doors and very tight turn to interior.    Restaurant is on two levels but a ramp has been laid down for disabled patrons.
594,"You can park near the rooms, but the ground is packed dirt / gravel"
595,"The shopping centre compromises mainly of two levels which house the retail units and majority of restaurants and food hall, with the cinema and additional restaurants on a third level. Each level is linked via escalators spread around the centre or by lifts that are available at either end of the centre.  If arriving at the centre by car, the lifts will allow you to directly access the level of your choice. If entering from outside then all entrances provide wheelchair access onto the ground floor.  Around the centre the walkways are wide providing easy access for a wheelchair."
596,Access is all on the flat through a wide gate and as this is a ruin everything is outdoor. There were some interpretation boards at a good reading height. The ground wasn't too bumpy.
597,"Security letting people onto Princess Street through a no go gate!! but not certain people, the staff who where handing out tickets and taking names seemed more interested in the food, drink and concert than assisting people."
598,Usually very good but often wait for service as staffing levels are variable.
599,Modern clean toilet. Only difficulty might be the high paper towels and only a sanitary bin. See photo. Left a cord card as it was tied up. 
600,"I was instructed how to use the scooter by a really helpful young lady. She said if I needed to go upstairs, to let them know so they could get me a wheelchair as the lifts couldn't accommodate the scooter. Later on when I needed to dismount to visit the loo, another staff member came over to let me know I could swivel the seat.  Really helpful."
601,"Access is by car. Solid surface, flat car park. No charge for blue badge holders."
602,"Forgans is a lovley restaurant in the heart of St Andrews. They serve good quality Scottish dishes. The restaurant is in market Street, slap bang in the middle of the town. "
603,There was plenty of disabled parking.
604,Good sized. One pretty near the entrance to the main hall.
605,Sean and Jackie own and run the hotel. They are welcoming and friendly with typical northern humour. They could not be more helpful and wanted to be sure at all times that we had everything we needed.
606,"Plenty of parking, including opposite  the rooms. They aren't proper 'disabled' bays but may have been designated for residents - can't remember - but you could also park right outside the rooms. Carpark had rather a slope to it. "
607,"Lime Tree is much underused so offers plenty of space to wheelchairs and delightful views. The café is part of the County Cricket Ground, available only to spectators on match days but open to all (7 days per week) on non match days. Because it is not in the city centre it does not attract much passing trade but that makes it all the more pleasant, never a problem with getting a table, always space for children and wheelchairs. It looks straight onto the playing area of the ground and so has large panoramic windows and is bright and sunny even in Winter!"
608,"Frases are located mostly on Buchanan Street which is pedestrianised, though buses and the locality of both Glasgow Central, Queen Street stations and the underground is within 3 mins. Mitchell Street multi story car park is close by with area parking on St. Vincent Street, be aware Glasgow isa grid system City Center, so lots of one way traffic."
609,Smart and modern with all required rails. Good contrast between white suite and grey slate walls. Right to left transfer space. 
610,Very friendly and helpful
611,Easy to get around but sadly some of the displays weren't too used friendly for people in a wheelchair as the frames were too high to see over
612,"Accessible toilet very easy to find. Plenty of room for carers/manoeuvring with chairs. Pull down grab rails next to toilet. Tap may be awkward to use due to small button rather than handle. Well lit, clean, and tidy."
613,All staff were extremely polite and helpful.   I paid  a Concessionary entrance rate and my carer went in free of charge. The entrance ticket is valid for a full year.
614,"Level access and space in front of post-office/ post box, proximity to bus and limited parking spaces make for good local access even in the absence of dedicated disabled parking."
615,"It was quite a pleasant drive through Marlow town centre and riverside, but very difficult to find the Crowne Plaza because of road works and one way system, we kept getting lost, let’s hope when works are finished that following a Sat NAV will be easier. On arriving we were very concerned as our first impression was that of a budget type hotel which did not impress us at all, but decided that having made the effort,  we would check it out and offer you a review.  WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE !  Inside, it’s a delightful hotel, we were really in awe, and pleased we did persevere. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY YOUR FIRST VIEW OF OUTSIDE AREAS.  The Crowne Plaza Marlow hotel is ideally placed in the Thames valley and close to Chilton hills, with easy reach from M4, M40 and M25 motorways, and it’s set in 5 acres of countryside, with views over its lake setting. Free parking, with 3 disabled bays available, a 168 bedroom 4 star hotel, built in 2002, and renovated in 2020, (but for us, the exterior deco and overall look was disappointing, a little off putting, but what a pleasant surprise inside ) with 3 floors of bedrooms, and inside you will find an AA rosette Glaze restaurant, which serve a very good Indian food menu, the Aqua bar lounge area, a conservatory with terrace seating with lawn views over to lake.  OUR REVIEW FOR PART ONE A pleasant roadside drive with well maintained grounds leading up to hotel (photo 1) with a woodland setting for its nice carpark (photo 2), then we saw the hotel, and oh what a disappointment (3)  Our first thought was to drive straight out, it looked so drab. But having made the trip, we decided to review it anyway. 3 disabled bays stand by the main door (4) and there was a pull handled door for wheelchair access (5) the other is a revolving door, but it’s all on the level.  Inside, oh what a contrast ! The reception area was breathtakingly highly polished tiled flooring, very appealing (6) and the seating area, which we called the meet and greet area, again very comfortable and very attractively decorated (7). The reception desk was in a huge open area, plenty of room to move around, and looked so nice (8). We found the toilets close by (9) but no disabled to be seen (10) but both mens and ladies were clean, shining, and very nice modern design, and ladies close to mens (11) that lead towards the bar.  This was a beautiful area with its piano leading towards the bar, (12) of which the floor was unusually laid but looked delightfully shiny and added to the appeal of the area. The bar had an ambience about it (13) looking inviting, so we relaxed in the comfortable lounge and enjoyed our drinks (14). We glanced into the restaurant, which again looked inviting (15) with an Indian menu on display. The hotel is run by very friendly polite Asian people, so if you like Indian food you will enjoy it here.Our overall look at the delightful restaurant, with its beautiful tiled floor, which gave it so much character (16) and a doorway led us into the conservatory, again inviting you to come and sit in it, (17) and enjoy afternoon tea, with very comfortable furniture (18) and a push handled door to take you out onto the terrace (19).  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS After the disappointing frontage to the hotel, inside was so elegant and tastefully decorated, the floors were highly polished and shiny, it was a delight to be inside the hotel. We would certainly recommend this hotel, just don’t be put off by the outside appearance. The staff were extra friendly and supportitive, it was so nice to talk with them all.    ON OUR PART TWO REVIEW, we concentrate on the Health and Spa club, do read this.   "
616,"The staff are delightful, friendly, courteous and helpful, but they lose two stars, one star for knowing about this very long-standing lift problem but not making appropriate efforts to keep the lift in permanent good working order, and one star for finding it amusing that the lift is temperamental.   One of the staff made me laugh when I commented on the range of wonderful books available in this shop, and I added ""I could bankrupt myself here!"" - his response was a witty, tongue-in-cheek ""Please go ahead!"""
617,"Car park on site.   Bus services run within easy walking distance of the Museum. From Wakefield or Huddersfield, the Yorkshire Tiger bus stops at the Reindeer pub with a few minutes walk to the Museum.   The nearest mainline railway station is Wakefield Westgate. It takes about 20 minutes for a taxi ride from the train station."
618,If the accessible door was working then access would be excellent
619,Plenty of level parking/turning room for WAVs .
620,Parking is sometimes a problem and more disabled bays would definitely be beneficial.
621,"The nearest step free tube would be King's Cross or Green Park, or some of the tube lines from Waterloo. There are many buses that stop very close by."
622,very attentive and friendly
623,Those we met were very pleasant and helpful.
624,The main boardwalk area of Port Solent is split over 2 floors. To access the upper level you need to use either the 2 person (push and hold button) lift or you have to take the long route round the back of the building to the car park and use the access bridge behind Casa Brazil.  Sadly despite many many calls to the Port Solent management office this lift still regularly fails with the door not shutting properly. 
625,"The entrance to the toilet is step free. However, the corridor inside the toilet is extremely narrow and a wheelchair will not fit. Moreover, there are no hand rails inside the washroom.  Please Note: The toilet is not inside the café. "
626,"We booked the cottage for a weekend break. As a wheelchair user, the accessibility was crucial, including the provision of a ceiling track hoist. It's a well presented property, with step-free access throughout the ground floor and very close to Southwold Pier. There is a ceiling track hoist from a downstairs bedroom with a single, electric profiling bed into the wet room across the hall corridor. We did have a few problems with the functioning of the hoist, and the wet room would have benefited from having a wheeled shower/commode chair, but it was a lovely place to stay."
627,"The bathroom in the room is large, laid out with thought, and as a wet room so everyone can stay clean."
628,The hotel has made great efforts to make it accessible but they are working with an old building. They have three fully accessible bedrooms and at least one alternative one which is quite adequate. It is the can-do attitude of the staff which makes this place a pleasure to visit.
629,"The parking area was quite big, concrete floor and tidy enough,  it no disabled spots, but very few use it, so no problems."
630,There is a wheelchair parking spot on Wellington Quay and two wheelchair parking spots up beside Dublin Castle on Cork Hill.
631,There are lifts available but only room for one wheelchair and able bodied use them
632,"Every car park has dedicated blue badge bays. Regular bus services, most buses are accessible. There is also a rail link."
633,Front door requires a portable ramp but there is plenty of space inside
634,It's okay. There is disabled parking at the front of the restaurant. It's big and clear and there is dropped curbs.
635,Staff were really good
636,An hour well spent if you like micro cars / bubble cars.
637,"No parking on site, car park nearby, 20 metres, Blue Badge, no charge, unlimited time."
638,Very friendly and had clearly read and used info.from welcome
639,"Very pleased to find a clean, reasonably spacious accessible loo on Cromer Pier, and someone before me had even put a Euan's Guide card on the emergency cord!"
640,20 disabled car parking spaces at front. Level access to visitor centre. Lovely self service cafe. When buying our tickets we were given a free carer ticket. There's mobility scooters you can borrow for free to go round the battlefields.  Very informative exhibits then flat access to battlefield.  We found the battlefields very atmospheric especially when the heavens opened!
641,"This hotel 2 years ago was part of the Hilton group, sold on to become M40 J15 hotel and now taken over as the Delta Marriott Bonvoy hotel, recently opened late 2021. Sadly, we were disappointed to note that no expense has been put towards bringing the exterior of hotel to an acceptable standard, especially as you arrive at hotel, then close to entrance rot is evident on many wooden areas, and generally it’s an unkempt outside areas, and we find Hotels of this description can be most off  putting, as to us, first impressions do count.  However, once inside it’s quite a nice hotel, clean throughout, recently refurbished, and looks inviting, that is if unlike my husband, you notice that a lick of paint on the woodwork areas would be most welcomed, but it should not put you off using this hotel, and if it’s a quick visit you need, somewhere handy to stay close to M40, then this would suit you well.  A large car park awaits you, with 11 disabled bays just to the side of hotel. (photo 1) A path leads ahead towards the main entrance which is easy to manage (photo 2) but it does pass a very unkempt wooden structure badly in need of maintenance, but it’s been like that for many years now, perhaps to be seen to in the future, but the picture hides just how bad it is.  The main entrance approach is very plain, and uninspiring, (photo 3) and then the swing doors are not wide enough to get any chairs into, so you have to use one of the two side doors, which have pull handles,  (photo 4) but almost impossible to open on your own. (Just in case you have to use) there is a small brick paved ramp to get on or off the hotels path.  (Photo 5) shows a pleasant reception area which awaits you, BUT PLEASE DO LOG YOUR CAR IN, you register details on the screen by the desk for reception. Then ahead of you is the bar lounge, and at far end is the bar itself, (photo 6). where you book in for breakfast. It’s a very pleasant area (photo 7) and relaxing to sit in. There is a spacious area for breakfast, clean and tidy ready for you to enjoy their breakfast.  It’s a buffet style help yourself arrangement, even for your hot tea or coffee, or cold drinks which you have to pick up and serve yourself, but with all the usual drinks available (photo 8) and the many buffet bars are well stocked and  cleanly presented with plenty of choice. (Photo 9) while cereals, croissants and freshly baked delicious rolls are available. (Photo 10) and a good selection of hot food provided at the far counters.  For evening dinner it is served in a small separated restaurant with a ramp for easy access to it (photo 11) and the restaurant is very warm and cosy looking, a very nice area to enjoy your meal (photo 12) There is a few nice seating areas to then relax in ( photo 13) perhaps to have a coffee or a drink later on and just behind this lounge, the reception area leads you towards the lifts and bedrooms (photo 14) with spacious corridors to the bedrooms (photo 15) and alongside are two lifts (photo 16) in which a scooter or powerchair could get in and spin around. Back by reception there are disabled toilets available, but with push doors, (photo 17) to get into the separate  mens and ladies disabled toilets, which are large enough for any chair to move around in, and are clean and tidy, with pull cords and grab rails  (Photo 18) shows the general mens public toilet, not the disabled one. Close by there is a gym available, with separate lockers and changing rooms (photo 19) and a good selection of weights and treadmills ect, and the whole area is very clean and tidy (photo 20).  Our final thoughts If you ignore the outside spaces which is rather unkempt, you will be pleasantly surprised when you get inside hotel. It’s cosy and relaxing to enjoy either a meal, or just to sit with a cup of tea or cold drink. We would recommend this hotel to you, bearing in mind it’s just a basic type of a motorway stopover hotel, perhaps a bit better than that, but it’s comfortable and clean."
642,I only spoke to the security officer and he was nice and helpful.
643,"The staff at the Sandymount Hotel are amazing always so friendly and welcoming, nothing is ever too much trouble and they are always willing to give you a helping hand if you need it."
644,It's a transport hub so that means it's facilities are great. The assistance team are wonderful.  The taxi rank is a long way from the platform's but there's good signage and a lift for access.  I'm not sure how accessible the tube station is.
645,Gravel car park lots of space and disabled bays. Can be difficult for wheel chairs
646,"We were staying in County Donegal and wanted to find an accessible beach, so I did a search for beach wheelchairs and found that there was one you could borrow at Marble Hill Strand. The information was on the county council website here: https://www.donegalcoco.ie/services/environment/blueflagbeachesgreencoast/ .     The beach wheelchair is kept by the Shandon Hotel, so we phoned them as instructed and booked the beach wheelchair for the day. Both on the phone and when we got to the hotel, the staff were pleasant and helpful, although we got the impression it had been quite some time since anybody had enquired about the wheelchair. And this was probably because... the Shandon is not actually near the beach! With some effort, we partially dismantled the beach wheelchair and just about squeezed it into the car with one of the back seats down, and then we drove to Marble HIll Strand, where we discovered that only one small section of the beach has an obvious concrete ramp down to it, and that is cut off from the main stunning beach by rocks and the sea. However, when we asked if there was any other way to the beach, a lifeguard tipped us off that we could drive down the main coast road to the far end of the beach and go down a private unsurfaced road, which was pretty sandy and bumpy, but not impossible for our standard family car. We were able to park the car - again with a bit of trepidation - on what was essentially a grass-covered dune off the private road, and then, with a lot of muscle involved from my partner, reassemble the beach wheelchair and bump me in it down onto the beach a few metres away.  This was all a bit of a palaver, but it was absolutely worth it, because I rarely get to go right onto such a fabulous wild beach with dunes, and we had a lovely time."
647,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
648,"Level entrance , all tables accessible and friendly staff to make you feel welcome and comfortable."
649,There is a bus stop nearby and St Johns Train station is nearby. Good size flat car park with disabled spaces next to entrance. On special days the car park is not always accessible but can park on road outside.
650,"The facilities are accessed by quite a few stairs, or there is a lift on street level.  The building is a listed building and is the old library in the heart of Perth City Centre.  Good transport links, and though there is no private parking, there is on street parking and a multi-storey car park very near by.  Bus and taxis are available within 100 metres of the venue.  The Venue is part of the keep safe scheme and staff are happy for members of the public to access their toilet facilities without using their services.  Staff are friendly and approachable and are willing to assist in anyway that they can.  At the moment there are only a couple of tables that are really suitable for wheelchair users, but Management are working to make changes to access so that everyone can access all of their facilities and services.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience."
651,"A gorgeous, modern and spacious hotel, with full access available for anyone with restricted mobility. Just be prepared to conquer the hills around this hotel!!"
652,"Staff at Ahsante were fantastic and extraordinary. Their sole function was to make sure we summited safely and they succeeded.  Entertaining, hugely friendly and humbling . What they have to carry up that mountain is embarrassing but they do it whilst smiling, joking and singing.   We had 33 staff between 11 climbers, although I probably raised those numbers because I am high maintenance!  Leader Julius White was awesome. He is clearly very well known and respected on the mountain.   We will be friends for life now.   "
653,"You would need to have transport to stay here. Parking very accessible outside of cottage. Lanes narrow as you would expect this far out in the countryside, but fine for our MPV."
654,"Delicious food - even their gluten free menu. Limited disabled parking, no disabled loo."
655,Another local cinema in Dundee which is fully wheelchair accessible where staff are always friendly.
656,"We didn't plan to eat here but we were tempted in by a member of staff - she wanted to share the menu with us but all I wanted to know about was the loo!  There is level access to the ground floor seating area plus a clearly marked disabled loo in the corner, which is well equipped.  Staff were helpful and attentive, giving me options for where we were seated. The menu wasn't extensive but included veggie iptions - it was delicious and I would happily go again if I'm in the area.   This is close to the Olympic Park, which is why we were here."
657,Good parking but the disabled spots are at the back of the building and that feels really horrible.
658,Very professional.
659,The main floor of the hotel has an accessible toilet with hand rails.  The hotel room bathrooms  have no adaptations for accessibility.
660,My daughter had a wonderful morning out with Simon and his pony Obama. Simon has a trap to which her wheelchair was fixed and off they went. For the first time since she was a small child she was on the sand and even into the water and she absolutely loved it!  This was arranged with PAMIS and St. Andrews tourist board but Simon can be contacted through the Website below  https://ponyaxes.com/ also pony axe s on Facebook 
661,"Only the ground level room is accessible so make sure your game is in that room - stairs down to the other room.  A couple of steps to get in, but if you contact them in advance staff will sort you out with a ramp. They'll also make sure there's a seat in the room so you can sit down."
662,"There is a ground floor toilet, at the rear for the café. It has a wheelchair user symbol on it. However when I spoke to the staff I was told that it doesn't have grab rails. I was queuing to use it, but decided not to wait as we were going to the nearby museum."
663,"When I was at eat (Leuchie respite centre)I went to The Puffin Restaurant in North Berwick, my carer went inside and emerged with two staff who assisted us to our table and were on hand in case we needed help. they were brilliant during my visit and were brilliant at engaging with me and not asking my carer what I would like. the menu offered a great choice as did the specials sheet. the food arrived sharpish and was great value for money and tasted great. I left room for a Pub and was very impressed with how beautifully clean the restaurant was considering how busy they were the staff delivered everyone with a friendly efficient and speedy service. my carer checked out both the Ladies and found them to be clean, fresh and tidy, she also said the disabled toilet was spacious enough even for my Electric chair if required. a lovely atmosphere meant that we had a great day out, Thanks to all at the Puffin. Also thank for supporting Leuchie by taking a collection tin for us."
664,No assigned disabled parking space outside the hotel but possible to arrange and reserve by an appointment.
665,Great if you have a car. Very good parking. I don't know about public transport. Blackpool is 10 miles from the cottages.
666,"The spacious wetroom style bathroom has a shower seat, lots of grabrails and even a wash-dry loo. Also an emergency cord and height adjustable basin. See the photos on the cottage website."
667,Parking is available on the street in front. Blue Badges are free but if you don't have a badge you pay at the machines before going into the Cafe or around the town. Can be hard to find a space at times.
668,"There is one unisex toilet which I wouldn’t say is very wheelchair accessible. It is a long narrow toilet and you are not able to get to the further side of the toilet due to the narrowness. I think there might be enough room for a wheelchair user and someone to assist them but, I’m not 100% sure as I just got my helper to take a photo. There are grab rails beside the toilet but no emergency red cord.  The closest Changing Place toilet is at the V&A which is open till at least 5pm everyday of the week."
669,"The accessibility at Deep Sea World was great but unfortunately the toilets let it down. I had to ask twice where to find them as they weren't well signposted. It did not have a radar key lock and was quite unclean. There was no red cord. I barely fit in in my powerchair, there was a bin infront of me and no space to manoeuvre (see pics). The lock was a bit dodgy and I was a bit worried it wouldn't hold if someone tried to get in. There were grab rails at each side but no space to transfer at the side of the toilet. The door was quite heavy and slammed shut making getting out (backwards!) a difficulty. In the two halls next to each other where the toilets were, there were at least rooms for toilets, the centre would certainly benefit from a more accessible toilet for people with disabilities. A larger accessible toilet, with less clutter, a radar key entry and a red cord would certainly make a vast improvement. "
670,All the staff were very friendly and helpful
671,The hotel itself had parking bays and some disabled parking but the main mode of transport I used was the subway and the trains to and from the city. People working in the subway or train stations were very helpful and willing to assist in any way they could.
672,We drove to the castle. The sign was not all that clear. There was plenty of parking at the castle and we were able to drop me off right outside the main entrance.
673,"I travelled to Ars en Re by bus. The no 3 bus travels from one end of Ile de Re to the other. The stop for Ars en Re is on a by pass, s 5 minute walk to the central square. The buses are coach style, with 2 doors, the front door by the driver has a sign for people with walking sticks, it's doable but has quite deep coach stairs. The middle door has a wheelchair sign. "
674,I don't know about transport but there where quite a few disabled parking bays which were wider than the normal parking spaces. Parking with a disabled badge was free.
675,In the bedroom ensuite. Raised with grab rails alarms etc.
676,"Not bad once inside, but no power doors."
677,"Just a typical budget hotel, but in a very good spot for the airport. Plain and simple, but nice staff to look after you, you could do worse than this if all you need is a budget type that would please you. We encourage you to read and if you feel it’s worth the review, would you kindly click the “I like” button and support our efforts for you.  We arrived at this smart looking budget hotel, with its five disabled bays (photo 1).  The main entrance has automatic sliding doors and it’s on the level (photo 2). It’s a typical looking budget hotel, (photo 3) with a minimum fussed reception desk, and a bar (photo 4) with comfortable seating. There is a clean, tidy basic well cared for restaurant (photo 5) serving buffet style breakfast (photo 6). A corridor leads you to lift and bedrooms (photo 7), and along here we saw a weighing machine to check your suitcase before boarding your plane, (photo 8) and it’s the first time we have seen anything like this, so what a good idea. Next was a small lift (photo 9) taking you up to your well lit pleasant corridor to find your disabled room (photo 10) and there is only the one available (photo 11).  Our final thoughts A typical budget hotel, well cared for by a young friendly and helpful manageress, who kindly showed us around, with her small team of friendly staff, but it’s in a good spot for the airport, and if you only need a budget type hotel, then this would suit you."
678,Huge carpark at Pickering less than 200 metres from the station with drop off possible.  Whitby station car parking is limited but plenty available on the harbouring. Drop off possible but the ramp to the platforms may take some finding. From the carparks.
679,My husband is still able to go to a loo himself so found it relatively easy to find a loo.
680,"Door opens outwards, and my carer had to get assistance from a member of staff to keep it open."
681,Only one automatic door opened 
682,"There were no steps at the entrance , just a small threshold which was easily negotiated. The path to the main entrance was brick and nice and level (just a very gentle slope at the car park end of it but nothing too severe). Apparently to get from the main eating area inside directly to the outside eating area and loos, there's a small step. However there's an alternative route round the side, which is level (albeit not so great for visiting the loo if it's raining!). Inside, the circulation space was a bit limited as the space was full of table and chairs. Stowing my wheelchair was a bit tricky, though the staff when asked said they had somewhere else they could take it."
683,"The whole site is easily navigated by wheelchair, Scooter or on foot. A quiet place built by the local priest and people of the community during the years of depression 1920’s and 30’s for people of all faiths and none. "
684,Lovely cottage. Level access in and onto the patio area. Plenty of room to move a wheelchair around. Electric profiling bed and mobile hoist. Fan wet room. Friendly and helpful owner.
685,"There are two accessible loos that I have visited. One in the reception area and a second adjacent to the Board Room. Both are fairly spacious, well  appointed and spotlessly clean."
686,The toilets had room for a wheelchair and have handles but there was no hoist or bed.  The toilets were clean and modern. 
687,"parking on the street, no nearby bus stops so only really accessible on foot."
688,Didn't really see any but reception staff nice.
689,Costa Coffee Shop has a disabled access toilet with grab rails etc
690,"The main entrance to the railway station is suitable for the use of wheelchairs as it is completely flat. Throughout the station there are numerous lifts which allow access to all platforms therefore not causing any issues. However, to the rear of the station there are no lifts available which means the popular National Railway Museum cannot be accessed via this route."
691,Changing places facilities and disabled toilets available but need to take lift to basement cafe to access. Additional accessible loo hidden away at back of 4th floor main gallery space - assistance needed to access two sets of doors and may be inaccessible at times when displays being changed.
692,Very friendly
693,Large and functional. Nearby the 'standard' toilets are minimal so there tends to be a problem with non-disabled people using the accessible loo
694,Lesley and Martin are very good hosts there when needed but not intrusive 
695,"Terminal Disabled toilet accessed with the key, but are not usually kept locked.  They are clean and functional and there are plenty of staff around ready to help.  I didn't try the toilets on the ferry but they are described as accessible and are disabled designated."
696,"The door is on the corner from memory, so it's a bit tight to get in here."
697,"Met a number of different staff. All were very pleasant and helpful. A couple were a bit pfaffy over-solicitous, frankly,  but far rather that than unhelpful or huffy any day! The guide was exceptional,  very interesting, responsive and helpful. Highly recommended."
698,"The Collective sits atop Carlton Hill and overlooks the city and sea. With splendid views of the hustle and bustle of the city, the sprawling of Leith and the docks and the sea in the distance it's a great place to while away a moment or two, take some pictures or enjoy a relaxing coffee. Formerly the home to the observatories and the mariners time checking it is now a creative art space. At first glance you are drawn to the thought that access will be tricky but closer inspection changes this perception as you discover the thought that has gone into making a welcome for everyone."
699,"Today we went ice skating and snowing tubing in Leeds City Centre. The staff and there awareness of disabilities was fantastic from booking the ticket and getting a carer in free without asking, to arriving and finding everywhere was accessible to getting on the ice. The staff were more than happy to let Dion where a pair of ice skates and helped push the wheelchair round spinning Dion at every opportunity which he loved. When we needed to make a quick dash to the disabled toilets we had an escorts to open the door and then let us back onto the ice. Dion even had a go on one of the snowmen I thought the man would think I was crazy to let him have a good but was more than happy to help me hold him up. Snow tubing was also fab alot of lifting involved but worth it to see his little face. The overall experience was seemless and I would recommend it for the whole family"
700,Very friendly staff on the day. 
701,Tramper trail with views over the Teign Gorge.
702,"Lots of buses go past, Knightsbridge Underground Station is close by (though I don't know if that has lifts or not). I don't know about parking"
703,"The site is very sloping and windy.   A free road train that runs around the site every 10 - 15 minutes so you can hop on and off at the stops as many times as you like,   however I found the train step high to get on and had to get a hoik up. There are hand rails on this.   I only visited the ground floor of the castle tower as there were too many steps. There is a wheel chair ramp to this floor.  The medieval tunnels were being renovated and was staff advised they would not be safe.  The WW2 tunnels were well worth visiting. There a small step near to the sloping entrance but the rest of the tour was fairly even. I am normally good at tripping up but found this fine.   There are a few sit down stops with films or broadcasts being shown. Beware the long outside tunnel at the exit which is a fair upward gradient. There is a handrail here. Also visited the hospital tunnel next to this which is a tour of about 20 minutes. I felt a little rushed through as you have to keep up with the group to hear what the guide was saying.  She told the group that there were a flight of circular steps to get to the surface however also said there was a lift for anyone who couldn't manage these which we were directed to.  The NAAFI restaurant has wheelchair access.  "
704,"Staff greeted me at the door and took me on the journey from door to gap for my wheelchair including grabbing coffee on the way! There is plenty of room, a spacious lift and roomy toilets."
705,Staff were helpful
706,Large space; level access shower
707,Staff were welcoming and friendly. Service was very good. Food was cooked fresh to order but there was not a long wait.
708,"The parking is not all that easy, it’s quiet a way from front entrance into hotel, and you will need to be pushed across compacted chippings, but it’s easy enough.  You will need to enter reception, before going out of far door to be able to see the Spa and Gym facilities. This means we can only offer 3.5 stars at the moment, it will get more points when work completed on refurbishments later on next year."
709,"Access from the carpark, there is a small ramp up to the entrance, you then go through double doors into the reception area."
710,Staff were friendly and helpful. 
711,Staff were friendly and happy to move tables and chairs if necessary 
712,"All the staff are delightful, helpful, friendly, and five stars for everyone except the snippy lads who told us rudely that we had used the 'wrong' lift. "
713,Stayed two nights (to attend a family wedding in the area). Edward and Marian were very helpful and we enjoyed our short stay in this well adapted cottage
714,Good access for those with a car. Cannot comment on public transport as our wheelchair is too big for buses and trains.
715,"Staff helpful and friendly, the staff within the viewing platform know their stuff and are more than willing to help."
716,"I managed to find a rare high street car parking space, myself, with  2 children and companion went to this venue. On arrival through the entrance gates, there is a white rectangle in the ground.mif your chair fits this, you can fit in the lift. Considering the age and historical nature of this building, I was totally surprised how much has been done to make it accessible. I would say avoid buys days/times if you can as some parts need you to be escorted by castle staff to access and if you go off peak  you have to wait less.  I was in a power wheelchair, having just changed from using a manual and mobility scooter. Some places you need very good control to maximise your ability to turn through the narrow spaces etc. Note a good Venue for the new to using equipment as some places are narrow and twisty and you need to be able to navigate round people eg the dolls house room.  Or back up and down a narrow ramp as there's only space for one user at a time, and it's the only way in or out of the house. However we will go back another day as my children weren't well which meant we had to end our trip early, but staff were amazing. It IS HILLY and STEEP and has COBBLES, some of the outer rooms have steps, so I didn't worry about accessing them, but worth knowing to help other expectations, and my companion was able to access help when we got stuck, or check out what I wasn't missing :)  I previously visited this years ago (in the year after the fire) and from my memories as an I disabled person, I was put aware of missing much :) "
717,"Within the city, Glasgow Green is fairly easy to get to.  There is parking on the streets nearby, also several car parks within a 5-10 minute walk eg near St Enoch's shopping Centre.  The train stations are a bit further away, the closest being Glasgow Central or High Street. There are also buses and underground."
718,"The food is lovely and the drinks are reasonably priced, their roast dinner hits the top 10 best list in Essex.  Dogs are welcome in there and friendly and the locals like to talk with you. They have comedy in there and drag nights, but these are downstairs and they only have one entrance. "
719,there is accessible parking on first floor of car park
720,A wheelchair accessible restaurant with amazing fresh food and fabulously friendly staff.
721,"The gardens are a real joy to visit at any time of the year.  Access is easy on foot, but there are some fantastic mobility scooters available, which gave my elderly mum a much more enjoyable experience - and we were out for hours.  All they ask for is a donation for maintenance etc.  Access generally to the shop and cafe is on the flat, straight from the car park a few steps away.  Thoroughly recommended."
722,We find that the staff at RSPB sites are always friendly enthusiastic and helpful. this was no exception. 
723,We were able to park in front of the hotel using our blue badge
724,There are disabled car parking spaces right outside the reception. 
725,"The trinity centre has ramps, lifts and automatic doors in place to make access easier for disabled users. The centre could do with having more benches for people to rest on if needed. The ramps when entering and exiting the centre make it easier for disabled people to get around."
726,"The Guinness storehouse is undoubtedly a great day out for tourists and Irish natives alike. The storehouse itself is easily accessible with lifts, ramps and plenty of room to move around. The tour itself is very interesting, taking you through the history of the drink itself and the process of how it's made. The highlight of the tour definitely has to be the gravity bar where you can pour your own pint of Guinness and enjoy it while looking out over all of Dublin. There is even a tap which has been specially adapted for wheelchair users. Mobility wheelchairs are available for use from the information desk free of charge. "
727,Nice small cafe. The tables are fairly close together but easy enough to deal with. Good views of the lovely harbour from a couple of the tables.
728,"Jeffery Hall is conference venue which can accommodate up to 320 attendees. It is located on Level 1 of the main UCL Institute of Education building.   I visited here as a visitor to a day symposium. I was told by staff that students have access passes, so wouldn't have the same issues as myself regarding entering or exiting the building. However, for an educational institution there is no equality for all. Disabled visitors with mobility impairments are unable to navigate this building independently in the same way able bodied people can and in 2020 this is ridiculous."
729,"The bus stop is right outside the Kingsgate centre on both sides which is convenient and the bus station is within a 5 minute walk, although the walk may take you over some cobbles. There is little to no parking near-by, the nearest/safest car park would be on New Row which is a 5-10 minute walk away. This can be very busy especially during peak hours. It is also a very steep hill up into the centre on town. There is more parking available at the retail park (Matalan ect) across the main road at the back of the centre but it is a very busy road to cross and exits from the car park are stairs unless walking on the road."
730,"Wide doors, flat level floor, plenty of room between tables. Mix of fixed booth type tables and seats and free standing tables and chairs."
731,Disabled loo beside each platform was reasonable size and reasonably clean. Security staff monitored the use of these toilets with some challenges
732,Open plan bedroom and shower room. 
733,There is parking directly outside the front door.
734,Parking is in the Tesco car park. Blue badge parking spaces. Some misuse of these spaces but you can park in the parent and child spaces with a blue badge if need be. These spaces are close to the store. Car park is a bit uneven so it can be a bit of a workout if you're in a manual wheelchair. The entrance to the supermarket has a bit of a ramp which can be difficult if you hit it at the wrong angle.
735,"There are no steps and all areas are wide, clear and open, no problem at all with my electric wheelchair. There are 10 bedrooms on the 1st and 2nd floors with lift access. we were in room 10 which had plenty of room for a big wheelchair and a huge ensuite with roll in shower, shower seat and plenty of grab rails. "
736,"We travelled by car, no carpark, parking was street parking and we had to go around several times to get parked. There was an accessible parking space along from the galleries, but no drop down on the pavement. There are local bus services to Kirkcudbright"
737,Limited due to it being a very small converted station waiting room on a platform however they’ve done their absolute best and made use of the facilities. 
738,Wheelchair accessible venue beautifully decorated with floral displays and quirky interior.
739,"All the staff we encountered, at the time of booking tickets by phone and on the night of the concert, were friendly, polite and helpful, with a good attitude to the needs of people with disabilities, and quick to offer help where needed."
740,"We booked ahead, which is advisable as this restaurant is extremely busy;  probably more so as it was a Friday and the end of the month.   The staff had a table reserved for us and the wheelchair fitted right under, which was great.  The drinks order was taken promptly and, shortly after, we ordered our food.  We were politely told there would be a 15 minute wait which was no problem as we had arrived early for our booking.   One of my friends had battered haddock and it overlapped the plate!  My brother-in-law had steak pie for a 'small appetite' and he said would have hated to have seen the size of a full-size portion.  This is the place to go for people with a healthy appetite!  The food was excellent and so was the price."
741,"There is a small car park near one of the entrances to the park. This does not have any designated disabled spaces or any spaces outlined.  There is a small side road between the car park and park entrance, both sides have drop kerbs. It is also possible to park on the residential streets near the park entrances but this is not guaranteed.  There are numerous bus services passing on the main road between the city centre / train station and Acomb, another entrance to the park is located on this road. There are bus stops very close to the entrance on both sides of the road. There are drop kerbs and a central island if the road needs crossing to get to the park entrance.   Each of the four entrances to the park have level access and the gates are held open during the parks opening hours. The openings are wide."
742,"friendly and welcoming staff, willing to help with anything. "
743,"Plenty of staff around to guide you and to ask questions,"
744,Blue Badge parking is available in the adjacent car park. Vehicles can drop off out side the main door. There's also an accessible bus service that runs into town. The Exhibition railway station is a short distance away if travelling by train.
745,"There is only one accessible toilet, on the raised concourse above platform 17. It's often grubby. The red emergency cord hangs in a remote corner and dangles behind a rubbish bin: it is, therefore, absolutely useless, completely inaccessible to anyone who falls to the floor. This is a mind-bogglingly silly piece of design. See my picture below."
746,"Parking is available on the road right outside the door in a part-time bus lane, which is in operation during rush hour. During these times you can park on side streets."
747,I'm not sure about parking or buses as I arrived by scooter and left by taxi.
748,"If you have youngsters with you, then this is an ideal visit, with lots for them to do, a very nice play area, and lots of farm animals to see as you walk around the farm. There is a very nice farm shop to buy fresh produce from, and it’s simply called The Farm, set in beautiful country side around Snitterfield, close to Stratford apon Avon.  As you drive in (photo 1) along the driveway you pass the pig farm, very clean and well looked after, no smells here, then the garden area, which you can stroll through. The car park is large and laid with hardcore pressed chippings, (photo 2) and easy to push a wheelchair along. The two disabled bays are very close to shop entrance (photo 3) which is all on the level, with automatic sliding doors (photo 4). Just inside the door you will find the fruit and veg section (photo 5)  again on the level, with stone or concrete floors, with plenty of room to move about. There is a reasonable selection of both fruit and veg, and good quality (photo 6). This leads you now to the fresh bread and cakes section, with an excellent choice, but although it’s not baked on the premises it seems it’s delivered fresh every day. Next to this is the wine department (photo 8)  As you move around the shop you will find plenty of space (photo 9) and it’s very easy to take your wheelchair, or even a large power chair.  You then come to the butchers, (photo 10) with lovely looking fresh meats on display, then the pies section (photo 11)  and on to the cheese counter (photo 12)  which has a really nice selection, but it’s brought in from local manufacturers and pre-packed, but very good cheeses.  The large cafe is next, (photo 13) with an outdoor seating area as well, close to activities for the young to enjoy, and the cafe has lots of room to move around in, (photo 14) with very wide spaces, it looks inviting, spotlessly clean, and ideal spot to enjoy your coffee and cakes. Coming out and back into the shop, you arrive at the world food section, (photo 15) where you buy your chutneys and sauces, not a great choice, but again, plenty of room to move. Just off that it a little area where you can buy crockery and bits and pieces, (photo 16) it’s just a fascinating place to look around, ( but it is a bit tight for wheelchairs, so may need care here. )  but you will also find a choice of plants which  are well looked after.  The check out is then by exit door (photo 17) plenty of room again.  However, we must say sorry to you, because we forgot to check out toilet facilities , we know they are there, but as we did not need to use them, we forgot, but if the rest of the farm is anything to judge by, then we feel the toilet would be well looked after for you. Our final thoughts We have enjoyed our visits each time we have come here, it’s always clean and tidy, never cluttered, so you can take your power chair here with no worries, the farm is doing its best to help disabled, and we are pleased to recommend a visit here for you. The produce is always good with a fair selection, we personally buy the fresh crusty bread and a few cheeses to enjoy with it. Outside there is a decent well looked after play area for children, plenty to amuse them, and there are farm animals to take them, ( or yourself, )  to see as well. An ideal Hour or so visit, so if touring around Stratford apon Avon, or Warwick area, why not pop in, and you will enjoy the countryside views anyway, this area is a delight for driving around. Do enjoy our recommended Farm visit."
749,"I spent around two hours here and couldn't find anything that wasn't accessible, although one or two of the floors were a bit rough in places. Quite a confusing layout at times but clear map was provided."
750,"The restaurant is pretty accessible as their is a good amount of room around tables but there is a step up to the patio and outdoor area. This would be a good place to visit during the festival, especially if it's raining. However there is about a 15cm front step at the entrance."
751,"All of the main building (shop/cafe/toilets) is on one level throughout, with even flooring. The outside doors (leading to garden area) require you to push a button and then they open automatically.  In some areas, especially when busy, it can be a little tight to get round displays/the cafe if using a bigger wheelchair, however this is more than compensated for by the helpful staff, who will move things out of your way if necessary.  Immediately outside the main building is the garden centre area - this is also all paved and good to access.  Some of the walks beyond this though - particularly the woodland walk, may not be accessible for everybody. These are in a more 'natural' state - in dry weather when the ground is more solid, some might manage it in their wheelchairs, but at other times it can be quite muddy."
752,This museum celebrates the history of Oxford that isn't University history. It isn't big but they have made good use of the space. The Town Hall has an accessible entrance and any wheelchair users have to go that way. My kids love the interactive display as you go in. The museum is accessed via a platform lift if you can't use the stairs. They often do an activity pack for smaller children. Check the website. There's an accessible cafe in the Town Hall.
753,The market is adjacent to the Multi story car park. It can be a pit of a climb if you aren't on the very top deck. It may be possible to park on street with a Blue Badge.
754,Car space right in front of lodge
755,Arriving and departing from the station was surprisingly good as a powerchair user. Assistance was on hand for both journeys and lifts and easy access was available to the platforms. The entrance and ticket office had automated doors and it was easy to see the arrivals and departure boards. The station is next door to a shopping centre and access into the centre of town was fairly easy.
756,"As is normal with Maplin, the staff were really friendly and helpful, five stars well-deserved. The young man who helped me was willing to fetch from the store-room any number of items not displayed on shelves, nothing was too much trouble for him - what a sweetie."
757,Yes there was a disabled toilet and it was a reasonably large size but the thing that really surprised me is that there was only one vertical rail that was on the wall behind the toilet cistern. There were plenty of horizontal rails and a drop down rail to enable side access but I require vertical rails and there wasn't one that I could use!
758,"The Zoo staff and volunteers were really good. From being greeted at the door and given an accessibility map, through to the mobility vehicle driver and the various volunteers dotted about it was a great experience. Staff took time to explain the best routes to take, what to see and where to get the best views."
759,As described in main review 
760,Accessible toilets can be found near the VIP lounge. They are clean & spacious.
761,"Meal for 2. Easy to get in as staff hold doors open. Easy to move about. Very close, very good disabled toilet. And food out of this world!"
762,Very central with good transport links.
763,Nice and helpful member of staff who was very informative about the history of the HMS UNICORN.
764,Good though the public car park has a steep slope leading to it. There are a number of spaces in the centre of town by the old town hall.
765,"I was surprised by the level of thought that has been put into making the theatre accessible. The provision of lifts, the signage, the various accessible performances, the ability to sit with more than one wheelchair user and the great view that you get from the dedicated spaces. Equally, the very positive 'can do' attitude from everyone I met - if you have access requirements I'd suggest having a conversation and they'll do their best to help."
766,There is a ramp. There is a buzzer to get someone to open door. There is no braille label. The doors are automatic openers but require a button to open. There is a hearing loop system in place.
767,"On arriving at Providence Place I found ample parking next to a ramp that gives easy wheelchair access to the entrance. We were greeted by a member of the family and given tea and home made cake, which was very nice. Our room was the first room on the right which has two single beds, one electrically operated. Easy access to the wetroom with plenty of room to maneuver a wheelchair. The dining room is just round the corner. We dined there both nights and enjoyed all our meals. The staff (family) really made you feel at home. You can also be as private as you would want if that's how you like to spend your time. On leaving to go to the beach it is a short way, i would say about 350 meters crossing a main road via a pedestrian crossing. PS  Booked to go back in November."
768,"There were signs in advance to prepare you for leaving the motorway, which helped me prepare. Their is wheelchair access in to the shop, but you need to go around the front of the building and in the side entrance. A staff member will open the door for you. They are looking in to getting a door bell installed. Once inside, the store is spacious and easy enough to walk around. The counter for ordering is quite high, so was a little awkward giving my order, but the staff were extremely helpful so this wasn't much of an issue."
769,Took 34 bus from home near Slateford Road to Princes Street opposite Castle then trundled up Castle Street to cruise George Street to Charlotte Square... Bus driver very helpful...
770,"You can park your car outside the front door, It is then no more than 10 feet to the front door."
771,"No wheelchair access into the office (you book by appointment). Some of the pavements/roads are smooth, others are full of pot holes. The cemetery is huge and there is two sides too it. To access individual graves isn't easy as the ground isn't maintained and the ground is very uneven. I do not recommend even attempting it in wet weather. "
772,"A family run business selling home made ice cream, cream teas, pies, jams, sweets, beer, etc to take away. Their speciality is ice cream topped with a dollop of clotted cream and take away cream teas. Opposite the shop, by the brook, are fixed picnic tables and  benches which customers can use."
773,They are busy but helpful.
774,"Several bus routes will drop you off in Shaftesbury Avenue or Oxford Street, there are no step-free stations nearby. Beware of missing kerb-drops at the junction of Old Compton St and Wardour St, this astonishing omission by Westminster Council makes great difficulties for wheelchair users."
775,"Great location, very friendly staff, nice and spacious and very clean room. The view overlooking Princess Street is fantastic. Could barely hear any noise from outside. Have Not stayed at this Travelodge before in the past so I never knew what to expect. Really enjoyable visit."
776,"There was a different door to enter due to wheelchair access, there was a small lift operated by staff both to get into the building and to get to the back of the church. This made it awkward as they tried to be super helpful and give you space but you needed to get someone’s attention to get back down and get back out.   I attempted the necropolis also, I’m a manual wheelchair user and had someone pushing. I braved the cobbles at the entrance but it was all steep hills as soon as you got in. Accessible for power chairs or scooters only. "
777," The Range is a store which sells home furniture, decorations and a variety of products that you might want and need. It is very easy to get around for everyone as they provide ramps and lifts both inside and outside the store so that it is wheelchair accessible. When entering, the customer service desk is reachable if you need any help while shopping around this large store. "
778,Helpful and showed me to my teaching area
779,"They have gone to great lengths to make this complex set of historic buildings accessible, and there's a free leaflet showing wheelchair users how to navigate the museum. My wife was admitted at a concessionary rate and I was admitted free as her accompanist. Platform lifts and conventional lifts mean that all areas are accessible, though the wheelchair route doesn't follow the strict chronological sequence. However, the free plan enables visitors to do so, though this involves covering a bit more distance. All captions are in English as well as Dutch. Audio-guides (no extra cost) are available in English and essential to get the most out of the Amsterdam DNA displays - see below."
780,Lovely high end hotel in a beautiful old house and garden.
781,If coming by car there is set disabled parking. It is about 15 mins from Haymarket station. For the more active you can also access the gallery by a set of stairs coming up from the Water of Leith. If you're arriving from Belford Road you know you're at the right place as there is an Antony Gormley statue to greet you at the entrance!
782,"Lovely staff, always friendly and helpful.   Two stars lost because they cram the display tables much too close together, making it very hard for a wheelchair user to pass between them, and because they don't fix lifts promptly. "
783,Parking right outside the door. Wide doorways. Large open spaces; large rooms and communal areas. Big wet room. H-system ceiling hoist in bedroom and bathroom. Profiling bed (much smoother and quieter than the one we have at home!) Overbed table (rare to have one of these in holiday accommodation) Easy access to garden. Plenty of room for the dog and his huge dog bed!  Furnishings and additional furniture didn't get in the way.  Really appreciated the large porch area - a good place to keep shoes/bags and all those things that get left in the way and clutter the floor. And on the same theme; the utility room was perfect for keeping the broom/washing basket etc out of the way.  Excellent WiFi and mobile reception.  Better than our own adapted home!  Why not 100%? My son couldn't fully get under the dining room table or the garden table. But he could get under the breakfast bar/counter and he can also use a tray (various trays provided). My son was using a TDX SP power chair with electronic leg risers. This is a common problem for us (visiting friends/restaurants/cafes ) as the top of the leg supports are high and they are quite far forward. Other chairs may not have this issue. 
784,"The Sill is the National Discovery Centre for the Northumberland National Park.  We were so impressed - its just opened and they have a full changing places toilet in the visitors area, highly accessible cafe and ramped access to the roof garden for views along Hadrian Wall.  The exhibition area had a lot of displays accessible from wheelchair height and was very interactive. We had a great day out and felt it had been designed very considerately for wheelchair users - even the circular benches outside had been designed with space at each one for a wheelchair to access the table."
785,I'm grading the 1950s area separately here. They have built a small row of shops and terraced housing. Everything is level entry and wide enough to get in and out. One of the houses even has a lift so wheelchair users can look upstairs too. They have also opened a 1950s community hall and access into and around that is excellent too! All the paving outside includes at least some that is not cobbled. They have done an amazing job of making this new area accessible without losing the period character of it.
786,"The Peak wildlife park is a fun day out for everyone. It is wheelchair accessible, has a cafe, soft play area, bouncy castle and a family room to eat your picnics if you have brought them and these are all accessible too. They have open pens that have the animals in that you are free to go into, there are lemurs, goats, penguins and many more. They have different talks throughout the day on all the different animals. The staff are all very friendly and helpful."
787,"The staff were very vice and welcoming, Even though we did not have the chance to go round the house, the staff at the other sites such as the gift shop in the Stable Courtyard and Courtyard Tea rooms, were nice and accommodating. They were ready to answer questions and offer assistance when needed."
788,"To enter Starbucks there is no automatic button to open the door and the door is also quite heavy. Inside it is very spacious and as you go in the counter is straight forward. We looked at the menus on the wall before we ordered but, I feel it was very hard to read because the writing was quite small and the light was shing on it from the doorway because it was quite a sunny day.  When we went to order our drinks I found that the counter was too high for me in my wheelchair. The glass display cabinet for the cakes and sweet treats is at a good height but, where the till is doesn’t have much visibility for customers and staff to see each other. It is hard to explain so, please see the image below.  It is quite spacious between the tables and they are mostly all at a great height to easily reach your drink. Of course some of the tables are a bit lower for sofa chairs."
789,helpful and friendly but not in your face. 
790,Raised toilet Wash basin and shower all in one  Clean and tidy Space for 2
791,Access into the store was easy through the automated doors. Once inside it was easy to manoeuvre around and see everything that was on display.
792,"There were allegedly accessible loos on all the floors we visited, but the Institute's idea of an accessible loo is a large room with a low level toilet at one end, an accessible washbasin at the other and no grab rails or alarm system. Side transfer would in theory be possible but difficult, perhaps even dangerous in the absence of grab rails. Wheelchair user and accompanist really struggled to make use of this facility, and there was no loo paper."
793,"There was a very small number of disabled toilets, which were mostly used as smoking facilities for supporters. They were quite small and poorly arranged, meaning they were not updated to a standard you would expect of an iconic football ground. "
794,"Car park changes made and provision of a Shuttle Bus on demand for wheelchairs, mobility scooters and a tail lift that someone can stand on for access to the bus too if unable to use the steps.  I was dropped off by taxi which then waited for me in the car park.  I returned to it using the Shuttle Bus but the House staff would have radioed the Welcome Centre to send the taxi back to me too if I had asked.  There is a bus stop outside, Johnson's No. 6 that runs between Stratford upon Avon and Banbury."
795,Two accessible loos. One more easy accessible than the other as one has a standard 26 inch door just before you get to the wide door.  The other has a wide door. Toilet seats are not suitable for side transfer but Fife Voluntary Action Manager immediately agreed to replace them once the issue was pointed out. 
796,Entrance is level access then once inside it is ramped or lifts which is operated by a key from reception. Good sized toilets. The gym is a good size but limited accessible machines. 
797,"It's quite well equipped though dated. The loo seat was very loose and difficult to sit on,  the layout wasn't ideal with barely enough room to manoeuvre the wheelchair inside - I reversed out.  It's position at the foot of the staircase was difficult if people were using the stairs.  The door was a bit tricky to lock (I had to twist in the chair as I couldn't fully turn the chair. However I'm jolly pleased they had a disabled loo and applaud them for that - it's located in the entrance hall at the base of the staircase.  Whilst there's a sign on the door, signage from the bar would be helpful."
798,"Very narrow pathways in restaurant but there is an outside sitting area, if one is being accompanied."
799,Kerry farm as a unique team of people that are truly accommodating champ fun to be around robin is very good with his advice ali friendly very helpful great with the children helps arange your days out makes your time stress free ! Chris brilliant always ready to help Tina incredible lady who makes your time truly amazing shes the best worker there The Children can warm to her shes lovely  Natalie is a amazing person her hard work shows in the farm she works so hard making sure every person whos stays gets  the true kerry farm experience she is the heart of the farm a wonderful person to meet
800,Lots of staff but mainly in the exhibition rooms.
801,"Attended for COVID booster and flu jab. Well organised , and smooth flow through the procedures. Boosted by army personnel supporting nursing staff to administer vaccinations "
802,"Accessible loo at far end of restaurant, quite a long walk for those with walking problems. Very steep slope to access toilets, felt my wheelchair was 'running away' even with assistance. Reasonable sized toilet, tight for turning. Higher height toilet, plenty grabrails, and cord for assistance. Grabrail only at one side of toilet, I need 2 as I need to push up on them to stand"
803,Restaurant is accessible using a lift. The door to the restaurant is not automatic and has to be pulled.
804,"There is a small step at the entrance, which most wheelchair users will have no trouble with. There is room to get around inside the café, but because the tables are quite close together it's not easy to find a table which is easy for a wheelchair user to manoeuvre into position at. There is a small raised area at the back which is reached via a small flight of stairs, not suitable for wheelchair users or anyone with mobility difficulties."
805,"Given the historic nature of the building, a former newspaper offices, getting around was fairly good. The hotel is set across several  floors and a lift connects you to these. Internal doors were wide enough for me to get through but did require careful alignment of my chair. The lift was compact and of the style where you wheel in and roll out with no turning space. Changes in the internal floor level in the conference area had ramps; carpeted to match other areas."
806,"The Anchorage is a lovely light cafe and restaurant by the ferry in Leverhulme, and the food and staff are very helpful.    However, the main door isn't quite wide enough for a wheelchair, and so staff need to unlock the second panel of the door to let you in.    There is a good-sized disabled toilet by the door, but sometimes there are empty beer kegs stored here - staff offered to move these very quickly, but maybe these could be kept elsewhere?"
807,"Access is doable via a slope at the main entrance, but you have to hope for someone to be coming out unless you have 3 hands, 2 to hold your wheels and 1 to pull the door open!"
808,Good disabled access. Accessible entrance with an accessible lift to each floor of the restaurant to access the shop as well 
809,"Clean. Loo very low. Well positioned grab rails.  However, easily 90 metres away, via outside bumpy path for most part.  Is locked usually as is in their boardroom suite. Not huge though got my wheelchair in it. No space for lateral transfer."
810,Trent Barton (i4 & Indigo) buses go past regularly.  Accessible parking pays outside the store. 
811,"Staff and good good, access terrible."
812,Accessible loo in visitor centre
813,Decent size left transfer.
814,There is disabled parking 50 yards away in St Sampson's Square. Bus routes run into the city centre with stops within 1/4 of a mile depending on bus route. All First buses have wheelchair access.
815,"Craigie's Farm is an ideal venue for visiting.  The food in the cafe is all freshly made and locally sourced. The farm shop stocks fresh meats, cheeses and vegetables as well as seasonal gifts. Access is good and all the staff are most helpful if help is required."
816,"All our help is provided for you on our part one review, so please read this advice."
817,"Disabled access is very good.  Although Leuchie House is on four levels there are two lifts, one gives to the lower level and the other to the first and second floors.  The first is very easy to use.  The second is a little more awkward involving pulling two doors shut but staff are always there to assist if necessary.  There is more than sufficient seating."
818,Lots of space.Easy to find.  Clean.
819,There are a few steps into the restaurant but there is a portable ramp that the staff put down. Inside the restaurant is really spacious and I had room to move around in my wheelchair without feeling restricted. The staff made sure I felt comfortable. I found the tables were at a good height for my wheelchair too. 
820,The hotel has its own car park at rear with a handful of disabled bays. But it is expensive.
821,"Brilliant staff, very helpful. All spoke English very well too."
822,"There is a wide, even path that stretches between each entrance to the park, so it is possible to go from one end of the park to the other by staying on the path. Next to the path are lots of benches to stop for a rest or simply sit and soak up the environment, most benches have an open area next to them so that a wheelchair can be placed alongside.  Some of the paths are on a slope, but there is seating close by if a rest is needed.  The woodland area is not accessible for mobility aids due to the woodchip paths and uneven terrain.  There are areas which contain steps but there are alternative routes to bypass these if  needed.  The steps in the rose pagoda walk has a handrail on either side."
823,Helpful & friendly
824,Brilliant venue that is really easy if you are in a wheelchair. Some fantastic acts playing here for a great night out. Fab food and toilets TOO!
825,Can get a bit busy making getting around more difficult but this is no different to other places.
826,Access in shop a little tight on the scooter.  More space for turning would be appreciated it's just a small scooter I borrowed. Plenty of room and seats in the exhibition  Easy access around the lakeside and gardens but being the Lake District it's not flat!  Easy access to under 5's indoor play area and outdoor adventure playground. I think some of equipment suitable for disabled youngsters. I can't comment on access at tree top trek.. The website is very helpful regarding accessibility. Much improved. 
827,"I have visited here before but I enjoyed it even more this time. It was a bit of a drive but it was more then worth it. Accessibility is always important for me and this was no different, not all paths were easy but I managed. I was impressed with the fact that all viewing platforms were accessible, some people may struggle on some paths as it's a bit hilly. I think some paths have been upgraded recently which was helpful. We got some great views of the animals.  "
828,Close to perfect very helpful and keen to assist
829,"Adjecent to the Special Assistant lounges there are spacious accessible toilets, with grab rails and low level, long bar to press for assistance, see photo . The accessible toilet by the SA lounge just after airport security is huge, see photos, but sadly has not been turned into a Changing Places toilet.  I mentioned this to staff and they said that there is a Changing Places toilet but it is in Arrivals. They don't have one in Departures. Therefore if someone needs to use the Changing Places toilet they have to be escorted by staff through to the Arrivals area."
830,"Eagle Lifter at Gatwick Airport - you can now book the eagle lifter direct with Gatwick airport if you need it. It is available on a first come first served basis and will need to be booked a min of 24 hours prior to travelling.  Just email Eagle.Hoist@ocs.co.uk with the following information,  customer name and contact details, date of travel and flight details, passenger’s height and approximate weight. Are you using your own sling? Have you used the service before?  Please share this info with anyone who may need it."
831,We really enjoyed our visit to Lymington and  staying in Garden Bench The master bedroom now has a ceiling hoist that is above the fully profiling bed. The hoist really made it a lot easier for me to get my wife out of the bed and into her wheelchair We enjoyed sitting in the garden watching the birds and getting some sun. This visit was our 5th and have just booked again for June 2020 You will not find better disabled accommodation 
832,"Flat entrance, automatic doors. New barriers/gates have been installed as you go into the store, but these also open automatically.  Flooring is smooth and on one level throughout. Aisles wide enough to get down.  As with all supermarkets, add some shelf displays could be put of reach if you are in a wheelchair, you may need assistance.   Noticed a powered sit-on scooter with trolley you can borrow. Also a trolley with a seat at the front (similar to where you would see a child seat on a trolley) which says it can take a person up to weight of 35kg. I hadn't seen one like it before.  I could not see a trolley which you could fit over your own wheelchair (particularly if you can't transfer).   There are basic manual wheelchairs you can borrow for while in the store.  "
833,I am a powered wheelchair user with poor speech. A disabled friend recommended the Magpie. They accepted my booking by email which avoids the inevitable queues. Our party of 10 all enjoyed our meals chosen from an extensive menu. The staff were friendly and helpful to me in particular.  The toilets are located on the top floor which is accessible for my wheelchair in the lift.
834,Staff couldn't have been more helpful and reassuring.
835,Disabled parking spaces right outside the ticket office.
836,On site parking available. 
837,"Starbucks is a big chain, so you know what you're getting - which can be good for planning for some people.  The venue is accessible, although the doors to get in are quite heavy and not automatic.   They don't have an accessible toilet, and the next nearest one is a five minute walk to one of the shopping centres. So it's ok if you're getting something to go, but might not be able to sit and enjoy your food and drink. "
838,"The views are phenomenal from up at the Plaza Mirador de San Nicolas viewpoint. You can see the Alhambra and the whole of Granada, and the surrounding mountains. It’s a unique feeling being there, looking down on the City and seeing all the places you’ve visited. I was there around midday and it was fairly quiet. This may be because sunset is the preferred time to go for the position of the sun and the way it lights up the Alhambra. At midday I was looking straight at the sun.  I went up on my mobility scooter from central Granada following the road that the bus takes. It was steep, rough because of the cobbles and hot in the midday sun. I enjoyed seeing lots of this old town area on the way. But, I’ll be getting the bus next time.  While up there, we had a drink at a restaurant on the nearby Plaza de San Nicolas. They brought out a small complementary plate of fried aubergine with honey which was delicious. We moved to another plaza for lunch which was the usual menu of Spanish food and I had the Tortilla which was pretty good. All of these places were accessed only by driving on cobbles. And finding a route without steps was a challenge.  I took the bus back down while my husband took the scenic steps. I had to drive over cobbles to reach the bus stop. "
839,"For a Bank and a busy one very aware and helpful, most of the staff are older and their experience is reflected in customer service, by closing Branches and mergers this Branch is very busy, always has more teller points than staff."
840,The access is good as there are wide doorways and the doors open automaticly. There is also a lift to take you to each floor. The isle's and walkways can be a bit cluttered and narrow once in the store.
841,We drove there and were able to park right outside the building. 
842,"2 Disabled spaces opposite entrance, cross access road to reach door."
843,The grounds are very flat and there are plenty of benches in the gadens and in the bird garden to sit and rest.
844,Staff are very friendly and very disability aware.
845,"Flat access with 2 manual doors at right angles to each other. Navigable by wheelchair, possibly a little too tight for a mobility scooter. Very attentive staff immediately on hand to open the door as you arrive Large restaurant with many tables although mostly set very closely together. "
846,Peace perfect peace.
847,"Great! When you get to the entrance there is an express lane and disabled people get free entry. You then take one of their very funky lifts to one of the floors to start your tour. When you are at the ticket counter you get a ticket to the Picasso Guernica exhibition with a set time allocation - so make sure you check that out! The museum is in a lovely cool and old building - so it's a welcome respite from the Madrid heat. The building is made up of 'corridors' with exhibition rooms leading off them - most of these rooms had a step but there had been sturdy metal ramps installed for all the rooms we wanted to visit. There's decent signage all around the museum - and smaller leaflets available for each of the different exhibitions. Exhibitions are well thought out and spaciously laid out - a mixture of art on walls, free standing sculptures and curated displays. The shop is on the way out and there is a decent cafe too! "
848,"Excellent. The toilet used had various sized slings, hoist and a changing /washing area."
849,Staff are very pleasant. 
850,Accessibility on the tube in the area leaves a lot to be desired and there are limited bus services in the area.
851,"We arrived by car, but there is a bus service "
852,Staff were very busy and did not really have time to give me any special attention
853,Free disabled parking available to rear of Museum approx 200m from front entrance via level pavements.  Required to collect an exit token from shop (show blue badge) which is a bit fiddly to handle.
854,"Large entrance with automatic doors were accessible for people with disabilities.  However, the aisles were tight and not well sign posted. Lots of staff to ask, but the checkout area was busy and the screen was quite high and hard to reach for someone in a wheelchair.  Also no toilets whatsoever but there were rails for support as you exited the shop.  Overall a decent experience, but not very disability friendly."
855,You can actually get in and move around but often has a queue of non disabled as always queues at the ladoes in a theatre!
856,"Excellent paths all the way around both lochs, very wheelchair and scooter friendly directly from the car park which also has a picnic area. If you choose to go around Loch Gaddon path, be aware there is a small incline to the excellent viewpoint over the loch; this won't be an issue for an electric wheelchair but may be a bit of a short push for a manual wheelchair."
857,wheel chair accsess to resturaunt excelent all on one level we were seen coming to the door and door was opened for us .
858,Plenty of disabled parking spaces. No public transport available. 
859,"Flat parking area but on large gravel, perfect for embedding your wheels into. I managed to back wheel balance myself across the worst of it, but I can't pretend that it was dignified...."
860,"When the manager came to open the door he said ""it's being used for storage"" whilst leaving very quickly. My partner had to go and find them again and when he came back I said ""you shouldn't really be using it for storage"" and he said he was doing his best by getting me the code and coming back to empty it out. He sounded defensive so I said I'm not trying to me mean about it and he responded ""that's how it was coming across"". I said well I'm disabled and I need the toilet so it's not really fair, he continued to empty out the storage without speaking or making eye contact and then left. No one ever apologised to me. All the other staff members were very helpful and polite and held doors open for me."
861,For a municipal site this has plenty of good facilities for disabled visitors. It's in a lovely area within easy reach of the town and is a great base from which to explore the Loire region. 
862,A good place for a wheelchair user to shop for books but the display tables rammed too close together make access to the books very difficult for a wheelchair user and DO BEWARE when exiting the lift at basement level - see below.
863,"Excellent accessibility from the automated front doors, the accessible toilet in the lobby, the large lifts, spacious restaurant, and great accessible room. Staff were excellent and very helpful."
864,"The staff are all very friendly and as well talking to you about the rooms or history they are all willing to help with any mobility issues, they have to control the lift but they were falling over themselves to help."
865,"From aircraft to terminal no issues, lengthy but moving walkways, small trams to terminalsall on on one deck level."
866,The staff were very friendly and helpful and would go and pick up something if someone had missed an offer such as if you got 2 boxes of sweets the 3 box was free idea. They were also happy to talk about the range of goods and give advice on sizes 
867,There is a paved ramp which leads to the entrance door to the Ball Room ( see photo). Unfortunately after entering the building you need to negotiate several steps before you reach the Ball Room (see photo). There is no portable ramp or alternative entry to the venue. It is not wheelchair accessible.  
868,"Ground outside coffee shop is deep gravel , but there is paving beside the disabled  drop off point to allow access to both levels of the cafe. The toilets are located on the Lower  level of the cafe , so would advise wheelchair users to book ahead, to ensure a table on the lower level. The paving extends from the main gates to the property, the gravel would be difficult for anybody with mobility problems to negotiate. Seating outside for a rest. Signage inside poor,  I had to get a friend to look for the accessible loo.  Cafe  split on 2 levels , with stairs between the levels, no lift or ramp. Tables were quite close together, friends had to move furniture to allow me to move "
869,"Although the hall is inaccessible (theres a substantial flight of steps), it is under restoration and there isn't much of it currently open to the public - so the gardens are in fact the main attraction.  Mostly the paths are good though there's a fair proportion which are deep gravel so not good for most manual wheelchairs or those on foot. The church at the rear of the site is now open and accessible.  The way into the stables area (where cafe is) is a bit uneven but not too precarious.  Entrance is via shop which as great access (spacious and level). There's a gentle winding ramp from the rear of the shop up to the gardens. The sunken garden can't be accessed as there are steps and no ramp - it is able to be seen though from the upper level."
870,"Very clean with good supports, paper towels close to sink and a mirror!"
871,The taxi had enough space to park outside the main entrance
872," As already mentioned the ground is a bit bumpy and uneven, however, access inside the venue itself was very good with lots of space to move around.  I was assigned an assistant to take me to my seat which they had reserved for me and which was with everyone else at long benches and chairs.  I felt this was really important at an event like this where audience participation was so central to the experience and while I know that this is not always possible and I appreciate every effort to make venues accessible and inclusive, it does make a difference to my overall experience if I feel part of the crowd. The venue is well-ramped and the only criticism I could give is that you have to go back outside to access the lift to take you upstairs and  although this only added to the overall industrial feel of the experience for me and I liked it, it might be an issue for other people.  The staff who accompanied me upstairs said that they are hoping to address this soon.  I had an absolutely fantastic view of everything and could swing around to see different screens, stages etc. without blocking anyone else's view."
873,I travelled by public transport. The nearest tube is Waterloo (very appropriate for Abba). Waterloo tube has some step free access but it depends which line and entrance you use. The Jubilee Line at Waterloo via Waterloo Hall entrance is step free with lift access between street and platform. And the Bakerloo Line via York Road entrance also. For all other options please check with TFL (Transport for London) website. Several buses stop nearby on Waterloo Bridge but there is a set of stairs to walk down. However the RV1 bus stops nearer to the entrance and exiting here avoids the stairs. 
874,"The staff were first class, particularly Samantha, who went out of her way to ensure that we had a lovely time. Staff were there to help with the pool hoist whenever it was needed, and were very attentive. "
875,Staff are brilliant and mostly friendly locals willing to help.
876,"Very spacious. many older buildings tend to use their largest toilet and they turn to be cramped and/or inadequate but this isn't the case with Filmhouse and the toilets are very clean and well stocked with all the things you need: soap, toilet roll and hand towels."
877,Incredibly friendly.
878,Some of the more modern cruisers have disabled like but by no means all.
879,"We have visited the zoo (Now WildHeart Animal Sanctuary) many times. I have visited whilst able bodied, in a wheelchair and using a mobility scooter. Whilst able bodied we paid the car park fee like everyone else. Once I became disabled and had a blue badge we decided to park across the road in the council car park which is free to badge holders. On our last visit, on exiting, we saw that the zoo car park is now free to Blue Badge holders, so one move in the right direction. There is a new entrance but it is still a steep slope and only one door was unlocked. It was not wide enough for either my chair or scooter (Which is average size) so it required someone to open the other door. This took some time. When paying for tickets, I wasn't asked for any documentation and have never been asked to show anything. But we do always carry this info with us. The zoo paths are as the other reviewers have described, broken concrete and deep gravel. In a wheelchair, a route around needs to be carefully planned. Some areas are too sleep or deep for someone to manage to push a wheelchair up or through. A scooter copes better but the deep gravel in the lion viewing area is far too deep even for Bessie (My scooter) However the lions can been seen around the other side which is where they normally hang out anyway. If they are on the rocks near the viewing area, they are high enough up to be able to see from a bit further back. Whilst most of the paths are manageable, don't expect a smooth ride. But some areas have been worked on so hopefully it will all get a makeover eventually. I agree that the fencing makes taking decent photos hard but this is the same whether standing or in a wheelchair as the fences are quite high (Thankfully) There is an indoor disabled toilet in the cafe. This gets used by anyone and everyone who is in the cafe. I used it once but it had a rather pungent smell that wasn't pleasant so I avoid if possible. There is another outside with the 'normal' toilets. This is also shared with baby changing but I've only had to wait once. The door doesn't close properly and I'm never quite sure if the lock actually works. The room is full of spiders, so I make my visits as brief as possible. I have some mobility so if I think I'm up to it I'll use the ladies toilets which are up 3 or 4 steps. Despite the zoo not being particularly wheelchair friendly, I always manage to see all the animals except the koi fish as the glass is always filthy and even standing up I'm not tall enough to see over the tank. All staff we encountered were pleasant."
880,Current plans in place to make more accessible for wheelchair users
881,Used Neatebox app again. Easy access into entrance and shelf at ok level when in chair to put bags up for security. All on the level. Went to reception and girl knew that I was coming through app and asked if she could help.  Got directed to room and staff opened door for me. All in all disabled friendly.
882,See pic
883,"I have only spotted one disabled toilet in the venue. There may be more, but I only know of one. If there is only one that would explain why it's also busy."
884,"This train station is a bit fiddly to get to due to the nature of Linlithgow's town centre itself. The car parks are quite small, but there are frequent buses along Linlithgow's high street."
885,I didn't use them but I hear there big
886,"The disabled facilities were good, there were numerous accessible toilets just along from the Wheelchair Spaces, they were large spacious and had numerous grab rails in places should they be required."
887,"At Rocksalt they have an accessible loo, however, there is a chest in there which makes the space smaller.  In addition, the door sometimes doesn't open very widely and it isn't very well lit either."
888,Adequate Blue Badge parking on a flat surface. 
889,There's a couple of disabled spaces provided at The Quay. Nothing to do with this restaurant. Oh and be prepared for cobbles. All the roads around the Quay are cobbled with deep ridges.
890,Clean and very roomy 
891,Staff in any shops or cafés we visited were extremely helpful and kind
892,A relaxing day out at gardens which have been made accessible as possible given the terrain and location. Most of the paths are rough but the rose garden and the summer planting borders are easily accessible and an access route is provided by the very helpful volunteer staff. 9 large blue badge parking spaces adjacent to a disabled toilet and the entrance to the gardens. There is also an accessible café with a second disabled toilet. In dry weather it is possible to cross the grass and enjoy the beautiful views over the Sussex countryside. There is also a small mobile van inside the grounds which sells drinks and snacks on good weather days.
893,Fantastic flat access and very friendly and helpful security staff in particular Nadine
894,"Although entrance to the museum itself is accessible, the street it is on isnt the easiest to negotiate if in a wheelchair, it's an old part of Edinburgh, and has some cobbles. It should be manageable though.  You are welcomed as you arrive and I feel would be supported if you needed any particular assistance.   There is a staircase, but also a lift. The passageways around the museum are wide and smooth. Mostly it is wooden flooring though there are some carpeted areas.   There are a couple of places going into some of the galleries where there are glass dividers /doorways. These possibly could a bit narrow if you had a larger power wheelchair or scooter.   If you download the app before you go, this acts as a guide to the museum. When there, you can borrow an ipad, which will give you further information about the galleries and let syou hear what the instruments sound like when they are played. "
895,"Disabled parking is at the rear of the premises. Local taxis serve the area but there is no railway station at Barnard Castle, the nearest main line station is Darlington 20 miles away.  I do not know any details of any bus  service to the Museum but buses do go to Barnard Castle from Darlington. and one could get a taxi to the Museum from the town centre. I drove from Darlington which was an easy journey of about 20 miles."
896,Museum is housed in a former 1930s bus depot. Collection of buses and coaches from the Isle Of Wight plus other bus related items. Has two disabled parking spaces next to the entrance but many more spaces on a flat surface. Step free flat surfaces throughout. Disabled toilet.
897,"A great trip with very welcoming staff, good parking and a brilliant view from the platform. "
898,the staff is   very helpful and friendly 
899,"Easily accessible, clean loos, with room for carer if necessary. Not a Changing Places toilet."
900,Staff were nice.
901,electric doors  no steps to gain access wide doors
902,There is a disabled toilet on the ground level .  In order to access the toilets and you must use the  radar key scheme .  See photo .  It is wheelchair accessible and very spacious . See photo .  There is an emergency right cord
903,"This is a large museum with many areas. In the WW1 area there is low level lighting and sounds of war playing constantly in the background. There are case displays, touch screens tables and audio/visual films. In some areas two wheelchair users can not pass. Other galleries have large open spaces. The 'spy' area has sloping floors so viewing isn't easy depending on how well you can sit on a slope.  There are 4 lifts in a central area with good space (one lift in level 4 just serves the Holocaust section). The restaurant had  reasonable space to purchase food and we accessed a table easily. Staff offered to carry out tray. The gift/book shops were just about accessible. The museum is ramped throughout on mostly smooth surfaces."
904,There are two toilets on the ground floor; one toilet/sink only and one in the wet room. The wet room has an excellent ceiling hoist. We hired a supportive shower chair. The toilet is a Closomat wash & dry and was easily operated by the user. For other users it also had simple flush operated by either elbow (no twisting required!).  The wet room is huge and we had no issues moving about or transferring.
905,Radar key operation. 
906,Parking on flat smooth surface next to the stations at either end - limited blue badge parking but we had no problem. In Bridgnorth - follow signs up the hill to the actual station not the lower car park. Enter the platform by the gate not the ticket office.
907,"A multi-storey, incense-filled, Bombay cafe overlooking St Andrew Square in Edinburgh. The food is superb, the staff (so many of them!) are friendly, and the access is pretty good."
908,Level access entrance with lifts throughout.
909,"The map given on entry was handy and we could plan the route before and factor in timings. As I said before I thought the slopes on the path were rather steep, and some people might struggle. I know area should be dark so the lanterns get the most impact but I did find it difficult to see my footing and I was worried about tripping up as sometimes the ground felt uneven."
910,Clean and spacious
911,"Helpful, welcoming staff."
912,We found staff friendly and helpful
913,"Parking was really good with lots of spaces, however, there is no accessible bus service to the venue.  They do have a minibus service for people who can use it."
914,"I was very sceptical about the accessible parking from the very start, and although there is no parking at the venue, what a service!! I phoned up the accessible parking hotline and gave them the date, time, venue and event I had tickets for along with the client reference number, they done the rest. Booked me accessible parking, for this venue, it happens to be the Forge Shopping Centre 10 mins away from the venue. A map and parking permit was sent out with allocated time slot for your session. We were slightly early but seemed no problem. 5 min later we were on the next accessible minibus."
915,Definitely worth a visit. It has good access. Although at entrance if you have a visual impairment or are unsteady on your feet be aware of the mat sticking up as this is a possible hazard.
916,Located in Spondon.
917,"The bouncers and staff are all friendly and helpful. They let me hold onto the key card for the lift for the night so that I don't have to keep going and finding them, which is helpful."
918,As we came up the path we were spotted and the door was opened by staff.stools were moved for us. Drinks were brought over to our table.   Similarly when we left the door was opened. Really helpful
919,Lift access is still available (use confined to one household at a time).  
920,"Driving from Midlands, Sat nav is helpful to spot the left turn off the Woodstock Road to the entrance, we might have missed it without that… We had pre booked and QR code was scanned on way into car park, short delay for this, but late morning on a busy Sunday, not surprising - was only a minute or two. There were marshals to help us go the right way, and the route to disabled parking area was very clearly marked, which is quite unusual in our experience! It was a short, flat walk on tarmac surface to the main entrance."
921,"Absolutely fantastic beach wheelchairs for ‘hire’ (there isn’t a charge but they welcome donations) There are quite a few chairs which would suit a range of different needs, and are available for adults and children.    You collect the chair inside a building, which has a brand new, large mobile hoist.   The building  is right on the front and there is a medium gradient slope down to the beach.  We borrowed a chair for a couple of hours (they look after your wheelchair if you want them too)   It’s best to book (on the phone) but I think you can just turn up and ask at weekends.    It’s a new project and they are hoping to get a Changing Place Facility in the future.  All the volunteers are very friendly and helpful - they seemed to genuinely care and want to help, without being patronising.  "
922,"inside the store everything is on the one level making it very easy for people to navigate around the store, there are always lots of staff on the shop floor and they are all very friendly and approachable. If someone for example in a wheelchair was unable to reach a product on the top shelf, the staff would help in a heartbeat. There are however no forms of braille in the shop maybe meaning its not always idea for blind people, this could be improved."
923,"I bring my son to sailability every saturday. The staff are very friendly,understanding,patient. He thoroughly enjoys his sailing."
924,As stated before the toilet that I used was a bit tight for space with a wheel chair. One of the others may be a bit bigger but I never had cause to look at them.
925,As I had pre-purchased my ticket I only spoke to the member of staff who was checking the tickets. There was a total absence of staff at the first floor entrance and once again after my ticket had been checked and I went through to the screen.
926,"Full marks for having accessible toilets on each floor! No having to do the interval dash to different floors! Each of the loos was spacious and had slightly different layouts ... 'yes', I did go and look at the all - can't help it when curiosity grabs you! Even  had Euan's Guide Red. Cord Cards ..."
927,Level concrete access everywhere.
928,"Once you've parked your car in the blue badge car park on the promenade, the access to Cromer pier is good. It's on the same level as the promenade, with well-maintained surfaces and no steps or uneven ground. I was pleased to see another wheelchair-user on the pier crabbing with her family and friends (this is very popular there - you can hire buckets and lines to fish for crabs off the pier). The reasons I haven't given the access a higher rating is because it wasn't easy to take a look inside the lifeboat station at the end of the pier due to a high lip at the door, and because I I couldn't go onto the beach.   The beach is a fair way below the promenade/pier level and is mostly reached via steps. There is a steep ramp down in one place but that would be pretty hairy in a wheelchair or scooter, and you'd immediately get bogged down in the sand and pebbles when you reached the bottom. I understand that Great Yarmouth, down the coast from Cromer, now has beach wheelchairs to hire and presumably a less steep way onto the beach, so that's the place to go if you want to get onto the sand in Norfolk. Meanwhile, there's plenty of other seaside stuff to do on Cromer pier and promenade, so it is worth a visit for wheelchair-users."
929,There is 4 disabled parking spaces directly outside the restaurant. 
930,"The staff were pleasant but very busy - seemed a case of one or two people having to do everything. This small hostel isn't staffed all the time, so be careful not to lock yourself out of your room!  One thing I'd like to thank the staff for is finding a way to accommodate me and my family when I phoned (hoping to book an accessible family room). They explained that their accessible room wasn't big enough for the three of us, but that if I was happy to stay in it on my own, they would book a neighbouring dorm room as a private room for my partner and our young son, and this worked well. And the prices at Alnwick hostel are so reasonable that booking two rooms in this way was easily affordable. "
931,Access was level throughout although the flooring slightly uneven with cobblestones as it is part of old stables.
932,Jane and Stuart are wonderful - very helpful and friendly and caring. They can also arrange support from excellent local carers where needed.
933,"Busy cafe toilets, but toilets on all levels."
934,New style accessible bathroom. We took our own hair wash basin as typically the sinks are too small to lean over. Plenty of turning space for over shower chairs but probably not a hoist. All clean and warm - my only person difficulty is the seat was an elongated narrowed style which hurts my pelvis. Always pot luck what fixtures and fittings will be used. Floor grip was reasonable. Large door entry.
935,Allocated bays at front entrance
936,"Once inside it was all deep pile carpet so challenging in a manual chair, but wide corridors and good space between tables."
937,They had a stair climber 
938,If you drove there is parking right outside. If you got a bus you would need to walk a tiny bit down the road.
939,"A great place to eat, with a perfect accessible toilet, but the entrance has two big steps and the portable wheelchair ramp provided is DANGEROUSLY short and steep. If you're a powerchair user, don't even consider eating here. "
940,The hotel is located right beside the A1 and about 5 minutes from the centre of Alnwick. Loads of space to park. Flat and easy access to the hotel.
941,"All level access into station, automatic at both entrance and exit. Lift down on to platform which is massive so lots of people could fit in at one time with luggage, wheelchairs etc. (see image below). Very hard to get an image of the lift though, photo doesn't do it justice.   Area to book train tickets is very spacious and has a heigh adjustable desk for people in wheelchairs to be able to reach and speak to staff without having to strain themselves. Walking stick holder and adjustable hearing setting available to. If a lot going on in train station even I can struggle sometime to hear the staff member as they sit behind a glass window.   Lift also has alarm button lower down which I presume is if someone falls in the lift. This is a really good idea and I noticed Edinburgh Waverley also had this. "
942,"Accessible loo in entrance hall, excellent plenty of room to manoevere , grab rails in place, however assistance cord tied up and locked away in a cupboard. As mentioned access to bathroom in room was impossible without someone holding door open. Roomy wet room with plenty of room to manoever, sturdy foldable seat in shower area, only concern was no info on weight restriction of seat. Grab rails in place, but could have benefitted from a horizontal rail to right hand side of toilet to enable pushing up off toilet.coat hook half waŷ down door kept banging my companion in the back causing bruising, would perhaps be better placed to side of door. Only half of floor where shower situated seemed to be non slip surface, would be problematic if wet with crutches or sticks, causing a slip hazard Lovely quality toiletries provided in room and public areas"
943,The car park is always very busy and unfortunately at the first hint of rain the disabled bays are flooded to quite a depth. (See photo). A bus goes to the retail park across the other side of the dual carriageway but it is still quite a walk to go through the subway.
944,"Did not use the public accessible toilet, but the toilet in the bedroom had a grab rail on the right hand side, and plenty of space.  "
945,The accessible toilets in the museum and the main entrance were fine. Easy to find and with all the requisite facilities.
946,"This Post Office has wide, press button operated door with flat entrance and although is 'full' of racks with cards etc, I am able to access in & turn round in my large Pride Mobility Scooter. The racks etc might be a visual overstimulation challenge for eg  autism or some visual impairments, but no more than many other small independent stores.  Although the roped queue system to main tills is tricky, the staff are very keen to help and will either open the side till or come & take goods & money from you. There is a small amount of off road parking and (although road can get busy) street parking too ..it is on a bus route and there is a pedestrian crossing  nearby. The staff are very keen to assist and with a large elderly customer base, I've witnessed staff be very patient and helpful with the challenges transactions can offer. They have a dedicated Facebook Page & have an outdoor cash point, offer full PO services & have photo booth"
947,The venue is very accessible with a ramp leading to the entrance 
948,"Coming through the countryside, we came to the farm shop (photo 1). We now pulled over to the right to reach the farm shop. There was at least 4 disabled bays outside the wooden sheds (photo 2) which held the shop. Automatic double doors to  enter the shop, however there is a tiny little step to get over, but it wasn’t a problem. This took us to the meat department, but it was all prepacked and there was room to move around quite comfortably. (Photo 5 shows ) a reasonable selection of veg,  but (photo 6) very limited fruit. In the refrigerated area, (photo 7) there was an assortment of goods. The bread was all rewrapped (photo 8) obviously brought in, as it seemed that it was not baked on the premises. There was also a few cakes, (photo 9) bottles of wine and eggs. There are three checkout points, (photo 10) and then you are back outside again. We then had to exit the farm, and drive round again, to come back into the farm, but this time we kept over to the left to drive round the back to the cafe.  Parking, (photo 11) we only found one disabled bay. Now it is quite a push from the car to the cafe, and If it is raining, you are going to get quite wet. (photo 12) The walk leads you to the brick courtyard, where the door into cafe would make a disabled person struggle to open it, (photo 13) so we left the wheelchair outside while we took photos. You pass the counter (14) were you will order and pay up front, but we feel you would struggle to find room for wheelchair or scooter in the crowded cafe, (photo 15) as it seems to be a popular place. There are two toilets, men’s, and combined ladies and disabled (photo 16) with a pull  handle to get in. There is not a lot of room in there (photo 17) but has got grab rails and pull cord. It was clean and tidy. There is not much for children to do here, few small bits and pieces, and only a very limited amount of farm animals to look at.  Our final thoughts.  Mixed feelings, I did not dislike it, but my husband was not impressed. The farm and shop are just wooden framed buildings, but in shop plenty of room to move around. It seemed to be very popular, so we leave it up to you to decide whether you visit"
949,"In the reception there are 20 lights in total, however only 8 of these are working and so this makes it quite dark.  In addition, when coming down the stairs, the top step is really difficult to see.  there is flourescent tape on the top step of the first floor, however, there isn't any at the top of the second level which makes it hard to access it."
950,The tables are just far enough apart though I definitely have to move chairs to get through. Often I opt to use the queue section to get out if it's quieter than the seated area.
951,"Very helpful, they want you to enjoy your visit"
952,"Looking for a pub to have lunch was made easy by the nice clear sign outside the building with a wheelchair symbol. The access for wheelchairs or those who can't manage stairs, is by a little lift that is easily operated and fits a wheelchair and one person. Lovely view from the 1st floor over George's square. It was incredibly busy (Christmas shopping ) but staff came over straight away and said they would look for a table for us so we didn't have to fight the crowd. It is a order at the bar restaurant, and again we were told they would take our order at the table."
953,Very helpful 
954,"I have always really liked this cafe, it’s an independent coffee shop with selections of food and drink. It has a flat entrance and a few seats in the window at the front. However, to get to the seating at the back there are 2 steps, with no rails. There is an accessible toilet, and a door at the side, which I am sure upon request could be opened for disabled access. The chairs are a bit wobbley so be careful when getting up. There’s a lay-by opposite for 60 mins parking but otherwise it isn’t far from town. "
955,We came by bus. The restaurant is on the corner of Lothian Road and Princes St so there are many bus options and also a tram stop a few minutes walk away. I am unsure about parking. 
956,To be honest the access is not the best but the staff are really helpful so it doesn't matter. 
957,"The disabled toilets are very, very impressive. There is one in the main entrance basement near the right hand side lift, and two on the ground floor of the main gallery in each of the two wings. Each toilet is incredibly spacious with plenty of room for manoeuvring. There are also height adjustable changing tables and a height adjustable sink. The toilets were clean and well maintained."
958,Wheelchair accessible with a few limitations. Needs more disabled parking.
959,We parked in the Bolton Abbey car park. Disabled spaces provided (not many but near the shop end). You pay per car - £8  and no blue badge concession. No separate fee for the abbey.
960,A wide ramp runs up to the door. The door is not auto-open but you can be easily seen from inside if you need assistance.
961,There is a toilet in the reception area by the breakfast room and lounge area. This is spacious and had a single grab rail. 
962,Two big a step with a chair 
963,The signage from the road to Hoe Grange was clear.  There was a level parking space beside the accommodation with a gentle gradient path up to the cabin.
964,We drove. Might be tricky by public transport. Large car park with disabled spaces
965,Perfect in a car. Parking right by the house with a paved area where you can put your car if a solid surface is needed.
966,"One small step into the shop, ample space a seat can be made available."
967,"Entrance doors are automatic, there are no steps on each floor, there are plenty of lifts and the aisles are wide."
968,"Screens 7 - 12 have flat access to halfway up the rows of seats so these are better if you're trying to avoid steps. Access to screens 1 - 6 is at the level of the bottom of the screen so only good for those who like a sore neck after their films! Although the accessibility info on the website is pretty sparse, and the phone line doesn't give you an option to speak to an actual human, this info was provided quickly and in a very friendly manner when I sent them a message on Facebook. There's a 'through' lift (cool! I'm such a big kid) up to the upstairs screens. The lift can be a bit dodgy though - sometimes the doors don't open upstairs and you have to go back down and get staff to help. The only problem I found was that the doors to the screens were closed and have to be pushed open, so this might pose some people a problem."
969,There is a large car park with multiple disabled access bays close to the main hangars. A bus service (121) runs between Haddington and North Berwick Mon-Sat which takes you right into the museum.
970,Few disabled bays with shocking prices.
971,Great . Extremely helpful and caring.
972,"Staff were lovely, very helpful and friendly"
973,"I came here last year (2018) for Christmas dinner and everything was exceptional, see my previous review. However this time the service was not very good. When I arrived a lady pointed in the direction of the accessible toilets, the nearest were near the bar. When I arrived at La Rotonde restaurant there was a short queue ahead of me. When I gave my name I was told I was not on the list. (This although I had booked and pre-paid for my dinner). The waiter went to get their manager and then I was offered a seat. I accepted a seat in the garden. It was warm enough to sit outside for Christmas dinner. However, I then waited 30 minutes, before I caught the attention of one of the members of staff and asked why no one had come to serve me. I was informed they assumed I was waiting for someone. I explained I was on my own and that they could have asked me or checked my booking. In either way I would expect better service at a 5 star hotel as I would have expected at the least to have been offered a drink while I was waiting. After that service improved remarkably. I had ordered a vegetarian menu and there were 5 course, each one was superb. "
974,"Those of us with memories of how The Astoria was before the refurbishment all agree it is now so much better. Warm. Comfy seats. But it could be so much better.  In the screens I've been to - 3 and 5 - the sound is much better. But the sound proofing is in adequate. Recently whilst watching Mary Poppins Returns there was a constant rumble from an adjoining screen showing some block buster.  Then let's talk about accessibility. Screens 3, 4 and 5 are accessible. They are not on ground level. But there is a wheelchair lift to take you down the equivalent of 10 steps. So far so good. But be warned, it is quite a walk to a disabled toilet on this lower level.  I first visited in November and refurbishment was still on going in the two upstairs screens. I assumed that to comply with accessibility requirements Reel would put in a lift to upstairs. Wrong! The two upstairs screens can only be accessed via the stairs. No good for me. (Ambulant disabled) Let alone someone in a wheelchair   I queried this when I visited. The young guy on duty was clearly embarrassed. ""I'm sorry sir. All I can suggest is you contact us beforehand and we'll let you know if the screen is accessible.""  Such a pity.   It's great that Reel cinemas have spent money on the Astoria. But its not a ""proper job"""
975,Very friendly and helpful.
976,The staff move around the vessel helping if they are approached. For the most part my interactions with them was positive. 
977,"The rooms are big enough to manoeuvre, the kitchen counter is a good height for someone in a wheelchair so very accessible. "
978,Well designed accessible loo.
979,Next to the gym on the lower floor was an accessible loo. It followed the high standard of the facilities in the accessible bedrooms. A large doorway to get in and plenty of space to move around.
980,Limited parking behind the building and nearby 
981,"As a blind traveller I am not going to get so much out of looking at the animals, I was there for the family. They did have some paw prints to feel and I enjoyed the sky train. The shuttle buses and sky train would help to minimise the walking if you have mobility difficulties, I would still say a fair amount of walking is required.Pathways were good quality, but there was some quite steep hills. I believe wheelchairs could be put on the shuttles, but I am not sure the skytrain would be able to accommodate these. "
982,Both entrances from the disabled parking area and the front entrance are wide automatic doors. There are no ramps or stairs. Unfortunately there are 3 floors and disabled users will have to use the lift to access the different floors. Unfortunatley there is only 1 lift so there would be difficulties should this lift break down.
983,They will offer a clipboard due to counters being super high. 
984,There is a designated wheelchair accessible room which is excellent. The only missing element is a shower chair but the management are aware of the need for this. All of the rooms are accessible with a little reorganisation although space could be an issue. The pub itself is accessible with a disabled toilet.
985,"We had a really good experience with them, from when I got in touch beforehand with some questions about the access, right through to the end of our stay. They happily agreed to put a child's bed into one of their accessible rooms so I, my partner and our young son could all stay together, and they were unfazed by finding a place for my hired scooter to stay on charge."
986,Disabled access is good. Parking close by with a gentle ramp to the wide front door to the building. Two lifts to go up to the clinic floor. Double doors to enter the main corridor. Wide door to clinic room.
987,Staff were very friendly and helpful. Everyone spoke English. 
988,The staff all seemed to be from Poland.  Very friendly and very helpful 
989,Very polite and helpful.
990,The staff the i intreacted with were friendly and pleasant 
991,"Fabulous, couldn’t have been more friendly or helpful."
992,"When I visited the accessible toilet I noticed the emergency cord was untied and had a Euan's Guide red cord card, which I found out one of the Ambassadors had just placed. The toilet had grab rails and was clean."
993,its perfect for people in wheelchairs as the is a concert path going all the way around.
994,"Poor sadly, a slight step at entrance and no disabled toilet. Infact, the only toilets are down a flight of fairly steep stairs."
995,The entrance to the complex was disabled friendly but the cineworld was on the 1st floor. There was escalators and lifts available which made the cinema accessible for us and they were clearly signposted.  Where we had to purchase the tickets from were a reasonable height to allow the staff to communicate with the customers of all abilities easily and effectively. There were flat surfaces all the way into the cinema screen that we were in and there was designated room for wheelchair users to be able to sit and watch the film with friends and family.
996,"Sliding doors,  ? toilet well signposted and next to reception area. Roomy and plenty grabrails although dropdown rail at one side seems to be missing"
997,"Riverhill is a regular haunt for me with amazing coffee and food. The cakes are AMAZING with plenty for all dietary requirements. However, even though the staff are a delight who are always happy to help an chat access is limited if you are a wheelchair user or have mobility issues with a small shop and high seating stalls and tables."
998,Good sized loo
999,"There is level access to the restaurant but the entrance door is not automatic. There is an upstairs dining area with further tables but it is only wheelchair accessible if you use the service lift. The ground floor is modern, spacious and has a variety of seating options. The chairs a the bar are very high (see photo)."
1000,"The staff were friendly and helped with finding the seating area, using the lifts and generally making the evening a success."
1001,Inaccessible to wheelchairs due to a stepped entrance. If you can use stairs there is a hand rail. There is no seating inside. 
1002,"Done spiral staircase, toilet is small and dim lighted "
1003,"Access to the building is by means of a ramp up the right side or 10 steps up the left. There are automatic doors at the top of the ramp. All desks for ticketing staff are low, ie not eye height. Bar is eye height and intimidating if in a wheelchair, over come by helpful, cheerful, respectful staff. Loop at desk and bar but if bar is busy lipreading is the only way to understand, amplified sound for films, subtitles, audio film description for blind customers. All cinemas are reached by lifts. Cinema 1 has a small conventional lift and then a steep ramp up to the 2 wheelchair spaces. To reach Cinemas 3 and 2 you use a temperamental old lift to go down 4 stairs - if this isn't working, remind the front of house folk that there is access via a back door that leads out onto a  cobbled lane. It's quite a long way, but they'll hold the film till you arrive! Cinema 2 is then accessed by another old lift with rather steep access and one needs"
1004,"The pavements from car park to cinema all have areas of lowered kerbs.  It is a flat level entrance from the pavement into the cinema building. There are push button /automatic doors, but these were set to just stay open on the day we visited (it was a hot, sunny day, so think this was just to let air into the building!)  Inside the floors are flat/level. As soon as we took our CEA card out, this was recognised and process of getting tickets was straight-forward.   The cinema we were in, all the spaces for wheelchair users is at the front of the room - some people prefer this, some don't. There were seats at sides of these for carers /family.  Before going into the cinema, I noticed there was a diagram of the seating layout on the wall, this was useful, especially if going in when the room is already dark.   The rest of the seating was tiered, with steps at the sides.   There were accessible (and standard) toilets in the same corridor as the cinema screens.   I am unsure if the layout within the other screens is the same - we only saw the one we were in! I did notice a lift in the entrance area, but I'm unsure where this takes you to. "
1005,It was a very acessable  hotel
1006,"This is a wonderful reserve. Everywhere is wheelchair friendly and very easily accessable. Good toilet facilities and nice and clean. Staff extremely helpful and pleasant. Lots of birds and wildlife. Very, very impressive, thoroughly recommended!"
1007,"I'm always impressed by the wide boardwalks they have at the Circus Hub. There's a nice clear path to follow throughout the venue. The trickiest bit to access is probably the bar, as it's the busiest part and quite high up. Access into the two venues is good. The La Fayette tent has good front row seating with wheelchair access - the best place to get a good view of all the amazing stunts! The Beauty is unique as it has its own bar inside if you need a refreshment during the show. I love how organised the queuing system is out here as well."
1008,Friendly but it was very busy so not chatty.
1009,An accessible trail through woods and beside river with good cafe to finish.  Some inclines and gravel paths make trail best suited to power chairs or scooter but shorter more level routes around cafe and river.
1010,"We ended up parking on a side street on a double yellow line - the bouncers said it should be fine. It was but we weren't all that happy leaving the car there. We couldn't find any other options.    Once we were out of the car we had to battle with the horrific pavements - lots of potholes, bumps, cracks etc.  Rarely seen anything so bad!"
1011,Large accessible loo on ground floor
1012,"The store has a large (free) car park immediately outside, which includes a number of marked disabled bays. It is all on one level, with flat entrance to shop.   The nearest train station is Dumbarton Central.  Dumbarton East train station is also nearby but note that this is not accessible for anyone using a wheelchair or with mobility difficulties.   There are buses servicing the area. "
1013,Level access around car park and into all shops. Automatic doors and lifts to upper floors.
1014,"Delicious Steaks in a roomy, accessible venue."
1015,The accessible toilets are again to a high standard the one in the main shopping mall is a little small and could be doing with a make over but that is a small issue.
1016,"Step free access, but heavy double doors to open to get into the venue. Quite a small place so might be difficult to navigate depending on equipment etc. "
1017,Very polite.
1018,The building has had a huge amount of renovations done to facilitate aceess from ramps to lifts and there is plenty of signs to show how to get there. You can to anywhere in the building step free. If you can make two small steps you can even sit in the back of the stalls and they will help you to and from your seat.
1019,Member of staff did offer to take me to staff lift instead of waiting for the public one Staff in gallery restaurant will ignore you at bottom of steps if you wanted to eat here which made me feel a bit of a nuisance so we ate elsewhere
1020,"Five old townhouses standing on the upmarket New Town area on George Street, Edinburgh, have over the years been converted into what many consider the finest hotel in Edinburgh, recently taken over, on 31st July 2019, and now named Intercontinental Edinburgh the George. The townhouses were built around 1780, and are now category A listed buildings. In 1840, number 19 was redesigned to become the headquarters of the Caledonian  Insurance company, and this is used today as the main entrance into the hotel, with its original stone carved name proudly on display as you enter the hotel. (Photo 2). During 1939 they sold their premises to the George hotel, who had bought no,s 21 and 23 in 1860, then expanded over the next few years. In 2009 it was voted the best hotel in Edinburgh, after being taken over by the principle hotel company, then sold on to Intercontinental hotels in 2018. The hotel stands on George Street, an up class area of Edinburgh. The first view of the hotel was very attractive with shrubs and flowers in many flower boxes. (Photo 1). The entrance is on the level (photo 2), with its old original sign as an Insurance company. We were greeted by two very friendly members, the manager and receptionist, (photo 4) and invited to sit in the reception lounge while drinks were ordered.(photo 3).   COVID 19 restrictions prevented us from certain areas, so an incomplete review. From the reception lounge onward, it is all steps (photo 5) so only someone with a bit of mobility would be able to use the facilities, and that’s sad, because it certainly looks a very nice hotel but we are deprived of being able to see it all.. The hall led us along to an elegant restaurant (photo 6)  and next to this was “The Printing Press bar and dining room, (photo 7) and we enjoyed a very nice lunch (8). Our final thoughts A very nice hotel, but unfortunately not suitable for disabled, unless you have  little bit of mobility to get up out of your chair. We would have highly recommended this hotel if you have mobility."
1021,Toilets are really good with a choice of 5 wheelchair accessible available.
1022,"From the support staff, the office staff, especially the ski school instructors are all really helpful."
1023,"There is parking at the venue though this costs £10, if you can, you can find on street parking."
1024,"Very good.   When I visited they were improving their disabled access, but the restaurant still accessible during the refurbishment.   To the right of the main entrance there is is run up to the restaurant. Once inside there is a small push-and–hold lift to take you to the main body of the restaurant. The lift is relatively discreet."
1025,"My Mum and I went to Costco to get some shopping. We walked in, Mum showed her card and the man on the door said that I couldn’t come in without a Face Mask. We explained that I was exempt from wearing a face mask and so Mum then helped me to get back to the car and went shopping on her own"
1026,"We had a lovely day, nice and quiet for Autism, not too bad access (my partner has EDS) and the cafe catered to dietary requirements quite well 😊"
1027,I think there's a bus from Aviemore. Plenty of space for parking for free or pay and display in the forestry commission car parks. 
1028,"I was really impressed with the access of this Argos. There was clear signage about what access feature were present right at the main entrance. Automatic doors lead into the building where there is plenty of space to move around. There was a dropped counter with a screen and two catalogues for browsing. The floors were all smooth and there were large, clear signs throughout."
1029,This hotel has 1 wheelchair accessible bedroom with a large wet floor bathroom this room is in the extension to the main building and is on the ground floor. The hotel entrance is step free and spacious. The dining room is accessible and spacious and offers lovely views across the lake. There is disabled parking on the entrance courtyard. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is furnished with Laura Ashley furniture and fabric.......see website
1030,Lots of space in the room and outside. Very big wetroom.
1031,Staff were ace. 
1032,"The staff are alert and friendly and keen to help, but they have lost three stars for their failure to keep the accessible toilet in order, as I've mentioned above."
1033,Staff were very helpful 
1034,There is no way to ask the locker to open a lower locker. I also didn't see any feature to make it audible. 
1035,"Easily accessible for wheelchairs due to smooth ramp at the entrance with railings, however, the aisles within the store are narrow and could cause difficult when maneuvering a wheelchair or mobility scooter."
1036,Plenty of room to park
1037,There were lifts and ramps if needed
1038,I drove to the venue and used the on-street parking which is situated on the left hand side and round the back of the building. 
1039,Staff were very friendly.
1040,I didn't converse with any staff except in the friendly cafe. But noticed staff creating and directing people at the entrance.
1041,There is a direct route from the High Street carpark to the High Street shops itself. You can walk through a small vennel from the car park straight onto the main street which is all pedestrianised so it's relatively safe for most people to walk about. The only thing I would say is that it can at times be a shared spaces area as some people do drive down at certain times of the day so I would one visually impaired people to perhaps ask a local shop owner about the busiest times. There are accessible parking spaces for disabled motorists on the High Street itself which are marked on the paving stones.
1042,there is parking all around the Abbey with designated Bays available
1043,We loved this bar! It had a great atmosphere and really reasonably priced drinks. A great selection of music on the jukebox. A really great night out in NYC.
1044,"The staff were helpful, friendly and welcoming, particularly the staff in Nasrid Palace. I didn’t get any looks of panic from anyone, which is rare. There was a language barrier at the Generalife Palace. I wasn’t sure what the assistant was asking of me. He just wanted us to check in with our passports because we had by -passed the main entrance. There were plenty of English speakers around so if you get stuck I’d recommend asking for someone who speaks English."
1045,"It's right bang on the villages Main Street, albeit its on a steep hill. The car park at the bottom of the hill is big and has three accessible spaces. It is a 2 minute walk down from Hillsborough Castle. "
1046,I took my five year old daughter who is a full time wheelchair user and my friend brought her five year old daughter who uses a walking frame. Both adults gained entry with our children’s blue badges free of charge as their carers. Which was a welcome bonus. After spending fifteen minutes waiting for entry with the next tour and explanation about how Lego is made. (No other way in)  We arrived at the first ride to find it completely inaccessible and a member of staff told us we had to go all around the complex to the front desk where we had just paid to show the blue badges we had just shown to enter to acquire a pass to gain access to the rides. Two very bored five year olds looking at all the other children passing them and going on the rides at this point.  I asked why it wasn’t done when we paid and why can’t someone just allow the children on a ride and a staff member bring us the passes. That would be positively discriminatory ifwe give you the passes before seeing proof that the children are disabled. A child in a big adapted wheelchair and a child using a walking frame and the receipts from gaining access as carers were obviously not enough. After that hiccup 🙄 the rest of the day was brilliant. The staff put the girls on first on al the rides and even one where they would’ve had to use their feet to press peddles in a police car they even had a special police car the staff pushed them around the track in. We didn’t have any problem getting around anywhere even with the mobility equipment (apart from a metal crunching crash when the girls collided while racing down a slope in the Trafford centre afterward lol I had taken my daughter to the changing places toilet at the Trafford centre on the way in as I didn’t know they had one inside Legoland so I cannot comment on the cp facility. But a great stress free (apart from the ride pass issue) day and lovely helpful staff.
1047,"It's on the ground floor, just inside the main entrance to the left. Equipped with a grab rail and an alarm, but small. Access is via a quite narrow corridor with a couple of doors to get through and circulating space is limited."
1048,Car needed. Ample space in car park. Disabled bays by entrance. 
1049,"All the staff were simply amazing. We were called at home before we travelled to check our dietary requirements. Every member of staff we spoke to was friendly and helpful. The chef made sure we had vegetarian food, even telling us that the trifle would not be suitable because the jelly contained gelatine. My Mum was offered diabetic ice cream because she is following a low sugar diet. "
1050,"Pretty good, we had no issues. Very slight lip on main door but it is wide and there were people there who couldn't have done more to help: showing us in, opening internal doors etc.  The seats are not fixed to the floor and they moved some do we could sit where we wanted to.   Room is large and fairly easy to find somewhere where you can see. If you are near the back it's not as loud.  Words to songs are on screens that are quite high up, but fairly readable font. Not sure if there is a hearing aid loop.   All the main activities are downstairs and so is the crèche.  Unfortunately the children's activities are upstairs and there is no lift - but they said they are hoping to get one in the future. "
1051,The walkway from Cannonmills has been upgraded and offers an elevated barrier free walkway. There are viewing platform areas to overlook the river and local wildlife. The section from the road bridge into St. Mark's Park has been modified to incorporate a ramp instead of the older steps.
1052,"I've already mentioned my tour guide, however apart from at the entrance and exit I didn't see any other staff."
1053,Access to the platform is good with ramps either end. Ticket machines and validation machines for cards are low enough for wheelchair access. A display tells you when the next trams are due and announcements are made. As a wheelchair user I found the wheelchair marking on the platform was great for knowing where you should wait to board the tram. Getting on the tram was a simple roll on roll off with no threshold to negotiate or tricky manoeuvres. Once on board there are two clearly marked wheelchair spaces.
1054,"No stairs to tackle, lifts"
1055,Access to the hotel was very good. From the airport using MTR and then free bus to the hotel.
1056," Both NTS and Galvanizers staff were lovely, helpful, welcoming and accessible if I needed them; I almost felt like a VIP and they struck just the right balance for me.  They made the whole experience even better."
1057,Stopped here for a much needed cup of hot chocolate after a chilly wander around the promenade at St Annes. 
1058,Super friendly service reliably Definately go back
1059,"Willie and Jan Orr, the owners met us when we arrived and had advice on accessible things to do in the area such as the nearby cycle track. They were really pleasant and friendly but unobtrusive, while making it clear they were more than happy to be contacted if we needed them. "
1060,By car.
1061,This is one of my regular pubs was asked to do review of a location for a student project so apologise if I miss anything to anyone who actually uses a wheelchair or any other disability. 
1062,It's not obvious how you get down to the Church until you go into Kings Stables Road. From here it's a level walk to the entrance.
1063,"The free carpark is beside the church, but only has 3 dedicated disabled spaces and two of those with hatch markings. One occasion we were unlucky with the dedicated places but I have a rear ramp so just used another space. "
1064,"Staff were friendly and welcoming. Food was ordered at the bar and then served at your table. As a solo traveller with a visable mobilty disability I found it difficult to get from my table to the bar due to the seating layout. It would have been nice if the bar staff had been a bit more proactive and more disabled aware by maybe offering me table service, and as a result of that after having my main course I decided not to go up to the bar and back again to order a dessert or more drinks as it was a bit of a hassle to ask 2 or 3 tables if they could move so I could get through to the bar, so I just left. This is a very personal observation and it wouldn't stop me going back to the pub again, it would have just been helpful. Next time I'd try to arrive earlier so I have the option of more free tables and pick one with earier access to the bar."
1065,"There is one accessible toilet upstairs and the standard toilets are downstairs - this is the reason for the low star rating. I've been to this restaurant many times now and consider it a family favourite of mine, but I feel the accessible toilet should have a RADAR key as it appears to be abused by people not necessarily needing to use it as it may not be very clear the standard toilets are downstairs. I've found myself having to wait for quite a while, while others are using it.   The toilet itself is a good size with space for turning. There are grab bars on each side of the toilet and beside the sink. The emergency cord is also next to the toilet and I've hung my Euan's Guide red cord card each time I visit as it seems to be removed. There is a big mirror on the wall too which is at a good height for wheelchair users - it gives an almost full-length view - yay! "
1066,"The accessible toilet was easy to find and had a large sign on the door. It was spacious, clean and tidy. There would be plenty of room for 2 people (a carer) to fit in. There were grab rails and an emergency alarm to pull if needed. There was a note on the door stating the lock was broken at present, which could be problematic for a disabled individual if they were alone."
1067,"Although the main body of this hotel is wheelchair friendly and the staff and food are lovely the bedroom I was allocated as being wheelchair friendly is definitely not.  The room did not provide enough space to move freely, the walk in shower was not good for someone dependant on a wheelchair, the toilet was far too low, the sink was too high and there was only one grab rail beside the toilet.  Also the bed was so high I had to be manhandled up in to bed and required to wake my husband up twice during the night to get me back into bed.  This I was told was the only room suitable for disabled wheelchair users. The room would possibly  suit ambulant disabled people."
1068,I didn't encounter any staff
1069,It's possible to park almost outside with a short walk to the door if you're a blue badge holder. Accessible buses serve the hospital campus and they're currently some distance away as you have to walk through the hospital.
1070,Ramp access at front door into a beautifully decorated space. Ample room to move around and considering the age of the building every effort was made to consider customers with limited mobility.
1071,There is a car park and has access from the main road. Calvert Trust also have transport facilities and transport the residents around during their week for the activities. The car park isn't a large car park if every resident wanted to stay the week it would be very full.
1072,We were spoiled as we had our own bus but there is limited parking available however be prepared for a walk!
1073,"A fabulous abandoned harbour, visited before I lost my mobility but knew my scooter would get me there. Parking at the top of the hill no problem. There is a 5 bar gate which is locked and a kissing gate which won't accommodate a wheelchair or a scooter.  There were people lifting pushchairs over. Husband walked down and said I could definitely access if it wasn't for the gates. I e-mailed the charity that owns the land pointing out the problems and asking if they could consider adaptations. The polite but curt reply was that they purposely didn't provide disabled access as after working with the local compliance officer it was decided it was not in the users best interest and informing me there were other places nearby! Nothing like exclusion! Such a shame because it's a beautiful place."
1074,Accessible station with helpful staff and lifts.
1075,"The signage is clear, and there is a leaflet showing how the disabled access works.  See above - the access is amazing..."
1076,Thank you so much! We’ve just been to Rachel’s to meet up with our son. We all enjoyed our visit and food immensely. Food was delicious and staff were very friendly and helpful. Rachael’s is excellent for those in a wheelchair. Design of restaurant very accessible and table space to manoeuvre very good and staff were very helpful. There is no Accessible Toilet  Ruth Douglas
1077,"The staff in any shop are always helpful and patient with everyone, all you have to do is ask."
1078,"Parking is available nearby, either on street or in the Grand Arcade car park. There are 4 blue badge parking spaces immediately outside the theatre entrance on Peas Hill, 2 in Wheeler Street and 7 on King's Parade, all close to the theatre. Accessible buses are available into the city centre."
1079,"Only used the downstairs one. Small with a bin taking up all of the transfer space. Entrance and exit was a bit tricky with little turning space. All support rails were present, No key needed. Very noisy inside."
1080,They have changing place toilets and normal accessible toilets the rest cord was hanging freely in the disabled toilet
1081,"It was very basic, but clean enough, with pull cord and grab rails. "
1082,Small slope between the inside and outside area but the rest is all level access.
1083,"In at the new bar, the majority of the tables have moveable chairs and there are some high stools as well. In at the music venue, there is a fixed couch that runs around the walls as well as some moveable stools. In the hallway, the fixed couch is a great spot for people watching and gossiping. The doors are wide and relatively easy to open. The ground is a mix of carpet and black lino."
1084,"Great Place with lots of room and a lift for eating upstairs if you prefer, has 2 disabled toilets, but NOT changing place toilets"
1085,Parking great - there is dedicated blue badge parking for the clinic just outside the door. Currently the bus stops are at the other end of the hospital as there is lots of building work going on.
1086,"There is a side entrance for those not able to manage the steps at the front, this brings you into the back of the stalls where most of the wheelchair spaces are. Lifts take you to the other floors, needed to get to the bar."
1087,The reception staff were very friendly and approachable. Joanne was especially helpful. 
1088,They have a ramp for those who are in a wheelchair but for getting into the theatre there isn't an accessibility point to get in as far as I had seen.
1089,The restaurants in this hotel is amazing.
1090,Use the map to make sure you're not going to get caught out by steps lurking round the corner. Everything is well signedposted and displays are at a good eye level mainly. Personally it would be good if the lifts had more space (often full) but i guess it is hard to do in a historic building like this. One or two heavy doors around some of the gallerys and as they're glass you can't really ram them with your footplates either!
1091,There are some Blue Badge bays in the nearby street. London buses also pass nearby. Charing Cross station is a short distance away.
1092,I visited The Chanter this week for afternoon drinks. I have been before when it was busier but really enjoyed the more chill atmosphere.
1093,Used building for meeting
1094,"Access around the airport was very good apart from in the departures restaurants where we visited, access was very tight for a power wheelchair. Not much room between the tables and chairs to move around."
1095,Pleasant and helpful.
1096,Disabled toilets in the cinema and outside in the shopping mall all disabled toilets are of a good size  and clean 
1097,"Parking is usually good but can get very busy so disabled bays can be full, however the rest of the parking is still quite good"
1098,helpful and informative
1099,"Our room had a clean, recently-decorated accessible bathroom with good rails for the loo, but it could really have done with some more shelves and hooks for your stuff, as there was only a ledge above the loo and the rim of the washbasin to put anything on. The shower had a pull-down shower seat, which was fine, but like the other hotels we stayed at in Ireland, only had a rail on the right-hand side of the seat. Because somehow you become better at standing up when you're using a shower rather than a loo?"
1100,"Staff was very helpful when needed with giving us directions to the accessible parking etc. A member of staff gave me a golf ball halfway around the course, he must've thought I was a golfer myself which put a smile on my face. "
1101,"The loo is located at the very rear so potentially a bit of a trek for some. Whilst not specially adapted, the owner has installed a rail to be helpful and is considering further improvements.  The loo is very spacious  there's no alarm cord but staff are close at hand.   No signage at present but staff can direct."
1102,Not enough accessible toilets and no one to stop abuse. I feel there should be a radar key lock on the toilet and also more accessible toilets as there were 1000's of people. The queues for the ladies/gents was huge so they were taking the accessible ones.
1103,Two entrances. One with steps but if you phone beforehand they will open the other entrance for you if needed (is occasionally locked) and this is fully accessible with no steps and an even surface.  
1104,"The access into the building was great but once inside, the cash machines were at good heights to use but were difficult to access in a wheelchair."
1105,"The number 2, 14, 30 and 33 Lothian buses all stop nearby at Prestonfield Avenue. Some cars do park in the cemetery entrance but it is not clear if this is just for residents or if people visiting the cemetery can park there. On street parking on Dalkeith Road is possible as long as it is not between 7:30 - 9:30am and 4:00 - 6:00pm."
1106,"The loos are spacious enough, with the grab rails and space that I needed. There is an accessible loo on the ground and first floor areas which house the hot-desking and the cafe area. "
1107,"Both lodges comprise a double bedroom with en suite wetroom bathroom with grabrails and a moveable showerseat, plus a twin room and a bathroom with shower over the bath. the only improvement I would make would be a higher level loo, but as there are grabrails, it was not a big problem. "
1108,Very helpful.
1109,"This lovely café in Walthamstow is fully step-free, has delicious food and drinks, a good accessible toilet and exceptionally lovely staff. Five stars richly deserved."
1110,"Lower level disabled access, standard width door. Good number of dining tables available on this level, staff will adapt areas without complaint and are disability aware, plus extremely pleasant and attentive. Access to toilets requires wheelchair assistance, staff will happily help if asked. In the absence of staff, customers are very helpful!"
1111,"There are a couple of entrances for a step free route I would follow the signposts and approach by the road leading to the car park. This is on a slight upward hill and passes the bowling club and tennis courts. This brings you directly to the house. From the car park area there is level access to some of the gardens, with flower beds. There are steps without a handrail leading to an upper terrace.  For a step free route return to the car park. To the right of the house is the Rotunda, between the two buildings is a wall with an arch way (see my photo). Go through the archway and follow the path upwards and round to the left and this will bring you to the side of the other side of the house and the upper terrace. When I arrived I used the grotto garden entrance, next to the petrol  station on the main road. I immediately had a flight of stairs to climb. The grotto area is nice with a lake. I'm not sure if there is a step free way to the grotto as while I walked around I came to a number of stairs and steps, often without hand rails. The garden contains many sub-tropical plants and shrubs. In the area surrounding the house there are plenty of benches."
1112, Very easy access . 
1113,The owners didn't speak much English but popped by a couple of times during our stay and were lovely. We were fortunate to have had a French speaker with us. 
1114,"Nearest place that any transport can get is the other side of the London Eye, about a 5 minute walk to where the boats leave from"
1115,"Level access, wide doors and hallway. Spacious restaurant with lots of room between tables. "
1116,"The accessible toilets (majority in school section) were pretty good, clean and support bars for access."
1117,Staff were lovely and helpful in all aspects
1118,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately 200m away on Station Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
1119,There  is a multi storey car park which is 500 meters from the venue doors . No concession for a blue badge .long ques to pay after the concert . We stayed at the stay bridge suits opposite the arena and this had free parking in the hotel basement  for blue badge holders
1120,"If there were no crowds it would be ace - so pick your visiting time wisely! There is an accessible entrance clearly marked. Inside there are corridors with vendors to each side of you - it's all on one level. The counters are all different - some high, some low, some with fixed seating and some with larger seating areas that you can rearrange tables and chairs as you wish. "
1121,"Easy to find accessible toilet,  small, in the older piece of the Lodge, but I managed in my wheelchair no problem. Grab rails adequate. The public toilet was smaller but in the room it was large. "
1122,"There is plenty of disabled parking at Bluewater in general, but none right in front of the restaurants if you just want to eat. The nearest parking is in front of House of Fraser, and the outside footpath from that set of parking to the restaurants is poorly built and too steep."
1123,Nothing to much trouble for anyone.
1124,"Only a token part star on this one as the accessible loo sign was covered by an out of use sign that bore the marks of having been there some time. In short, if caught short, you'll have to find an alternative ..."
1125,There is a large parking area which will accommodate adapted vehicles. Own transport is needed as it is set in country lane off the A68.
1126,There is a dedicated blue badge parking space right beside the door. Blakeney is right by the sea in rural Norfolk so public transport is a lot trickier!
1127,"A drive through countryside views will bring you to this lovely old Jacobean House, which has ample parking spaces, with just one disabled bay."
1128,"My partner/carer and I went to go see Alun Cochrane as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. His show was amazing. The venue was nice and clean but not exactly accessible. There were about 12 steps down into the venue itself which were fairly evenly spaced out and no visible access without stairs. As it's a small venue there were tables and chairs so closely packed together that even if you could get in without stairs, you wouldn't have been able to manoeuvre yourself in a wheelchair or with a walking aid. Props to the staff they were great and got me a highbacked chair when I explained I couldn't sit in a backless chair because of my condition but as the venue was small and completely packed, we were very close to the stage so it hurt my back anyway. The staff were lovely, the bar was affordable but again the bar wasn't at an accessible height and there isn't enough space for access to the bar with mobility aids.  Thankfully I was having a good leg day otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get into the venue. "
1129,"Family gathering of 14 Scots, Americans, English and Aussies - staying in Massney lodge and various properties around the village. Access excellent for one of the group - a w/chair user.    We dined in the Paxton Centre, which has level access, 2 accessible loos and a lift to the upper floor - you can rent rooms if your ‘party’ needs additional space. Forth View can seat up to 24 and the views are stunning."
1130,The disabled parking was fine - plenty of space and near the entrance. 
1131,"Amazing. Upon finding I would have trouble getting up to a part of the castle that had interesting drawings and views, they brought out a makeshift solid ramp and ensured I could get up and down safely. As I couldn’t get up to the main rooms they stood with me and gave me a “private tour”, expertly described. For me this makes up for missing out on some extra castle."
1132,Accessible to wheelchairs but not everything is within reach. 
1133,"Share baby changing facilities, however the loo is a very good size with good facilities."
1134,"Wheelchair accessible bar,restaurant and theatre. "
1135,There were disabled toilets behind the disabled shelter but I didn't use the toilet so I can't comment.
1136,All on one level with access to platforms..
1137,"There were bumpy, uneven and slightly raised floors in several sections of the aquarium, which meant using my crutches was difficult. The lift was okay, but there wasn't adequate signage to tell disabled visitors where to go after going to the second floor. It was good to be able to get a free carer ticket, but I wasn't impressed with having to phone up rather than being able to use their website. I can't use the phone so I had to ask my mum to call and book for me."
1138,The disabled loo is accessed directly from the cafe - unfortunately it was out of order on my visit.
1139,changing places!!
1140,There is good disabled parking outside the entrance.
1141,Lots of parking bays. You can drive right up to the respite lodge.
1142,It's placed near a bus stop with many different routes.  The parking isn't good.
1143,"It's all very flat with smooth pave stones. Lined with restaurants and bars, all with lots of seats outside. Regular performers in the square! Great place to sit at night."
1144,"Lots of ramped areas, underfoot cobbles leading to road crossings only at main crossings and roads. Pavements often uneaten with high steps. There was no visible signage, ample seating, we did not notice disability within the community where we were or in the central part of Tirana."
1145,Very helpful! Staff often walk around the floor so you can call for help or ask questions. Upon joining I had a tour of the gym and then later another induction chat where a member of staff talked to me about my goals and how they can help with my therapy routines.
1146,Fantastic historical ship - surprisingly accessible - lots of thought has gone in to making it an inclusive place to visit.
1147,"Great, friendly welcome  Concessionary tickets for carers Door from cashier desk to attraction not automatic but a member of staff immediately opened it without needing to be asked. Staff always on hand to help if required and to give information about the animals in their care"
1148,High step at front door but staff rushed to help me lift the scooter inside. Lots of room to move about inside and everything is on one level.
1149,"The waitress was extremely helpful, making sure I was comfortable, service was good"
1150,A single unmonitored disabled bay means it is regularly abused and staff do nothing to assist the disabled community by asking other shoppers to move their vehicles.
1151,Stratford is an accessible station and there are people in bright pink t shirts greeting you when you arrive. They direct you to the accessibility transport to the venue. We weee told where to come after the concert to be returned to the station. The people operating the minibuses were lovely and made the journey easy. I’ve never started a concert so easily. You are dropped next to an accessible entrance so really easy to use public transport. 
1152,Street parking available.
1153,Lovely flat service but not much room. Couldn't see a loop sign. 
1154,"The toilet itself is good but it's down a long corridor and the doors are heavy and not automatic,  somebody always gets it for me but is not by any means a guarantee"
1155,Automatic entrance doors. The museum is housed in the old railworks and is very spacious - there is no clutter to navigate round. A lot of very well planned ramps and lifts means that all of the museum is accessible.
1156,Access is to all areas and easy. Can get to merchandise and bar areas easily and you can ask helpful staff if needed
1157,Not very good to be honest.
1158,"Access is great at The Grand there is a lift at the front of the hotel for wheelchair users or people with reduced mobility. Otherwise you can gain access through the carpark into the hotel, thus is all on one level. The staff were very helpful offered us one of there wheelchairs ( I had my own). One of the concierge men wheeled me through to the restaurant."
1159,Lift access to upper floor where the experience starts and to lower floor where the experience continues. Plenty of interactive screens and displays
1160,Loo had raised seat my husband has difficulty usually with loos but he found this easy to use
1161,"The car park by the Nature Centre has accessible spaces. Cost is £3 for parking all day.  If you were getting the bus you would have to walk for about 10 minutes from the nearest bus stop (by Chilwell Retail Park on Nottingham Road/A6005) to the nature centre.  If you wish to get the train to Attenborough its a 15 minute walk from the train station to the Nature Centre (walking along Attenborough Lane, Church Lane and through nature reserve)."
1162,This outdoor cinema event is run by Blue Monkey Events and show a number of different movies throughout the summer and possibly other seasons.
1163,"Whilst on holiday in Washington DC we crossed the Potomac river and drove to George Washington’s Mount Vernon. There was no obvious disabled parking bays at the visitors centre at the entrance so my dad dropped us off and parked in the car park. Inside the centre there were security checks and toilets. Before watching a short film about the history of Mount Vernon and George Washington we had a look at the miniature replica of the house and the stained glass windows (see photos). After the film we walked outdoors to George Washington’s house(see photos).It was busy and we had to queue before getting inside the house. Despite it being April it was a little chilly. The ground floor level is wheelchair accessible but the upper floors were not. As a consolation there was a little booklet with pictures showing the contents and use of the upper floors. After viewing the house we could have gone to Washington’s tomb but decided not to as it was quite a distance away and the weather was still a little cold. Instead we went to see the slave quarters. It was wheelchair accessible and all the information boards where low enough to read (see photos). Then we went back to the visitors centre where there was lots of information ( in different formats eg text, audio and visual) about George Washington and his life from birth to death.  Inside the visitors centre fast food was available and the dining area was wheelchair accessible. We had pizza 🍕. There is also a spacious large accessible gift shop. Although there were a few inaccessible areas and parts we didn’t go to the visit was very interesting and well done. If you are interested in American history it is definitely the place for you.  I think the best time would probably be in the summer."
1164,"Large garden centre with plant area outside , large cafe and children’s soft play area."
1165,"Excellent all round access both in the complex and surrounding areas including the restaurants and bars,only drawback as i mentioned is the small lifts on the complex that are a problem if you cannot get out of your wheelchair and the apartments themselves are not specifically disabled friendly  but i manage and i only have a small amount of movement now."
1166,"The Wellcome Collection is a free museum which specialises in health and health related sciences. It's fun and informative an has  both permanent galleries and temporary exhibitions which cover a diverse range of topics. Also located in the building is it's library which is free to join, a café on the ground floor and a restaurant on 2nd floor, both offering a delicious range of food and a shop selling books and quirky gifts. They also hold regular free events, on both a prebookable and drop in basis. It has excellent disabled access."
1167,"All staff were friendly and helpful, but the Gondola operator in particular went out of his way to ensure I was able to experience going up the mountain,  looked for solutions to my access problems, and took an interest in my experience when I came back down. He also stored my own power chair and my walking frame somewhere safe until I returned off the mountain."
1168,This venue has a disabled toilet that was relatively simple for me to navigate in my powerchair though a radar key was required. 
1169,Pub has its own car park right by the back entrance from which there is step free access into the pub.
1170,Could be marked better and nearer to the Main door
1171,"This restaurant is a great place to stop by while exploring the rural areas East of Alkmaar.  It is a great place to stop for a drink, or an authentic Noord Holland lunch."
1172,"Full accessible, very large in size and had a variety of handles, grab rails etc. Overall it was brilliant."
1173,"As I mentioned before, the staff I came across were either very friendly and helpful or not either characteristic. For example, at the information desk there were members of staff that were eager to please and very helpful and I noticed there were 2 members of staff with an 'attitude'. In the cafes (especially one called 'Coffee Fellows' - which has free wi-fi) the staff were very helpful but in an ' upmarket' restaurant called the Red Baron the staff were not at all friendly or helpful!"
1174,Super helpful from door staff to cafe staff and everyone in between.
1175,"Exemplary.  Eg moved a chair for me, asked if he could help, then tactfully withdrew when I said I was fine.  Welcomed my dog too.  Helped with door when I left."
1176,"Friendly, helpful English-speaking waiter is the restaurant I Leoni."
1177,"This little cafe is on the south side and the western end of Rose Street which runs parallel with Princes Street, next to Charlotte Square.  It’s all one level and not packet with chairs and tables, it’s a family orientated environment as there were families there. The wee ones had been offered drawing materials and lollies to compliment the children’s menu. The food, well prepared, well presented and particularly enjoyable the traditional and vegetarian breakfast were very good, we were offered alternatives to some items we did not prefer, which was good value. There was a wheelchair user and he family there and a chair had been removed and 2 tables put together for them all to be together. The staff could have not been more friendly and attentive, I could imagine it being busy during the hols and the festival."
1178,Very helpful and very friendly
1179,Accessible toilet with room to manoevre and grab rails.
1180,Just parking on road outside but pretty busy area so space not guaranteed.
1181,Great for us but would be difficult if in a wheelchair due to the amount of space available once the bed is pulled out.
1182,Went with a pal who was (and is still!) scared of heights - he wanted to challenge himself - but even he enjoyed it!! Everything was super easy - from buying tickets to joining the queue (you get to skip to the front) and entering and exiting the pods themselves... Definitely recommend!
1183,"I have just spent a week at the Barn Cottage,I am also permanently in an electric wheelchair and this cottage is ideal as I had no trouble getting  around,it is excellent for the disabled and so nice to find accommodation to suit people in wheelchairs.I can highly recommend  this cottage,and the area is great for sight seeing. So all in all I had a really good holiday."
1184,Access has improved since earlier visit with more space
1185,Very friendy and nothing too much trouble.  Had a couple of minor issues - staff attended to them immediately.
1186,Lovely place good lower counter but too much food on it to be if any use. On the Saturday we were there it was very crowded. There is a lot of room but to get from the counter along and round with a chair or crutches it’s very hard. When we asked for help she gave a sigh but did carry the tray saying it might be better to visit on a day it’s not so busy. That made us feel unwelcome on a Saturday.  On using the disabled toilet when going to wash out hands we got soaked the sink was leaking underneath so water came out of pipe. On reporting it was told the out of order sign must have fallen off. Not a great experience
1187,"A visit to Cleethorpes MUST include fish &chips and I’d recommend Papa’s. The food was yum (!), the menu was printed on a newspaper. The restaurant overlooks the beach and it also appears to be a small music venue with a stage (and disco light!).  The biggest drawback was getting through the doors.There are two doors to tackle and neither are automatic so it helps that the venue is popular and there are people to help."
1188,"I visited with my wife on her collapsible mobility scooter.  We toured the gardens, visited the cafe and the ground floor of the house. There we no scooter access to the house, but they lent us a wheelchair to visit the ground floor. Most of the ground floor was accessible and well described in the printed descriptions. However, the upper floors were not accessible except by stairs which was disappointing as there were pictures from the National Portrait Gallery on display (and there was no video display for those limited to the ground floor). The gardens are lovely, the cloud (aka wobbly-wobbly) hedges a special feature, the paths reasonably level, but there is no circular route meaning you have to retrace your route several times."
1189,"BB,s for coffee and cake. Staff helpful"
1190,Not very helpful their stand and stare instead of trying to help you. 
1191,"An expansive, exciting and interesting event with something for everyone. Superbly organised with very friendly and helpful staff. "
1192,"There are several help desks throughout Meadowhall, where there are maps which can be provided. They also offer any other help which someone may require such as loaning a wheelchair or any assistance required. I found it was difficult to find these help points when first going to the shopping centre therefore it could take time."
1193,"Big open space with well thought out positions of the sinks, showers and bathtub as well as the two toilets. One of witch is directly under a discrete lift-rail so that even people of extreme mobility limitations can relive themselves comfortably.  Best shower"
1194,There are spacious accessible toilets with grab rails and an emergency cord. The toilets were clean and tidy.
1195,"Prior to a Christmas carol concert I visited this venue with a man in his 30s who is able bodied and has learning difficulties, most notably autism.  We rarely experience physical access difficulties when out and about, although Burger as I remember offers pavement level access and the floors are smooth and flat, very stylish in fact.  I did not have to think about wheelchair access regarding toilets, so can't comment properly in this respect. However I can say the staff we encountered were quite lovely, and dealt with my friend's quirks with grace and elegance. They were very respectful and if I was supporting a person in a wheelchair I'd certainly give them a call with a view to going back there. They are about 100 yards from the tram stop in Edinburgh's West End at Shandwick Place."
1196,"Easy to get into and no steps to trip over. I was with a wheelchair user and he found it relatively easy too. The lift isn't very easy to find as its camouflaged into the wall design, both of us walked straight past it. But once we knew where it was, it was great - my wheelchair user friend reckoned the lift would fit 10-12 wheelchairs in it easily - a fantastic asset!  "
1197,Top marks to all the staff. From the ticket lady who helped us  and explained the concessions through to the guys who helped us board the cabin and get off once the ride was over. It was all done in a seamless manner with no fuss. Fantastic job!
1198,"The way down to the beach is - out of the car park on the path, bear left, round the barrier (plenty of room round the side for pedestrians) then turn right down the sandy track through the dunes. You're then straight onto the beach. There's no pathway beyond this so you'll need robust wheels (I have an electric powered wheelchair trike which manages firm sand and rough ground well). You may need help getting back up the track on a short stretch of soft sand. Avoid the really wet or really dry sand - otherwise the beach is fantastic and you can go for miles in either direction. At the country park, there's a metalled path round the lake - highly accessible."
1199,"Movement within the hotel is easy for wheelchair users, with steps to the breakfast room avoided with a lifts platform. A hearing loop is available at reception "
1200,Staff escort you to one of the disabled changing rooms - each has a shower (with shower seat) and bench and plenty of room. Lockers solely for the use of disabled visitors are located right outside the loo and the First Aid team will look after the key for you so you don't have to take it into the loo. If you need more than one locker - that's fine.
1201,"As a visually impaired person it was important for me to be able to use public transport. There is a small car park where there is an accessible parking space available.  For me, having the taxi rank outside the front door was a great plus. I noticed that many of the city’s tour buses also pass by the door. They were good as they have audio commentaries and the drivers are very helpful if you don’t know where to get off if you’re unfamiliar with places."
1202,"Level access from pavement, easily accessible toilet on ground floor foyer, level access to stalls."
1203,Ramped access available at the front of the building  with two sets of automatic doors.  There is a wide foyer for two wheelchairs to pass easily.  Good size of rooms to use activities.
1204,"We went by wheelchair taxi, which parked directly outside"
1205,"A bright and airy cafe beneath the science library in King's Buildings. It's a modern building, and thought has been put into access throughout. The cafe is particularly spacious and comfortable. "
1206,Easy and large parking area 
1207,"Stables tearoom is accessible with a wheelchair but a mobility scooter would need to be left outside the door.  There is a central courtyard where you can sit at the picnic benches, plenty of room for chairs/scooters.  The Theatre,  Cinema, Bike shop are all accessible and best of you can borrow a mobility scooter and go for a 2 mile ride right round the park."
1208,"The first we encountered was without doubt the worst we have ever been in. It was too small. There were no proper grab rails. There was no alarm. The door wouldn't lock. You had to pass the other loos to get there. It wasn't very clean. Luckily we fund a perfectly acceptable loo in the Philharmonie, where we had lunch in the cafe. No alarm, but a decent amount of space, a grab rail, the possibility of side transfer and also very clean."
1209,Table service available. 
1210,Wheelchair friendly rooms are available on request. There are a few lifts in the main lobby and the rooms are spacious. The corridors are quite tight in the hotel but managable when empty.
1211,"Once inside the hotel there is a small reception area on the ground floor and the restaurant which is up a few steps, they have however installed a ramp for access to this area. Getting from the rooms to the restaurant is where things get tricky - for instance, from the room we stayed in a wheelchair user would need to use 2 lifts, a stair lift and a ramp to get to the restaurant. However, it may be possible to get a room closer on the first floor which would only entail one lift and a ramp. Other than this there are stairs throughout all with handrails installed. The room we stayed in had a very small bathroom and using the toilet was tricky as it is so close to the shower, I cannot however speak for any of the other rooms. Noting these things is important, but also it is important to pay testament to the work that has been done to this old building in order to make it as accessible as possible and to mention that the staff at this hotel are particularly helpful. "
1212,On several bus routes. On the Bristol to bath cycle path. Shares its land with ‘Warmley Wheelers’ cycling for the disabled. Council car park and on street car park very near. 
1213,"Arriving at Stratford Station, not to be confused with the International Station, it feels confusing but the staff were great in helping point out the accessible routes."
1214,Brodie Castle is old and access can often be difficult if not impossible but there can still be lots to see and do. Brodie Castle has beautiful views and parkland to walk in and explore.
1215,"Requested walk in shower as am unable to climb in/out of bath. None in the hotel but “wheelchair accessible” room allocated. Hotel offered to book us into another hotel “who could better cater for my needs”. As this was a family meet up involving 8 people/ 4 rooms this was not appropriate for this visit. Asked about Blue Badge parking reservations and told this could not be done, dispite reviews on TripAdvisor saying they could. Room had wide door but no automatic opener, was very spacious and comfortable but the “wheelchair accessible bathroom” was just that - accessible but no rails by the toilet, the sink, soap dispenser and razor plug were all at normal height. There was one rail on the wall on the opposite wall but no grab rails to assist getting in/out of the bath. There was no bath seat nor was a none slip bath mat provided."
1216,"Unfriendly and not helpful,"
1217,very friendly and helpful to all customers
1218,A beautiful moated house run by the National Trust with famed displays of dahlias in the charming gardens. 
1219,Really excellent and lots of staff members around. There was no confusion about how to access the wheelchair accessible seating. 
1220,Toilets on a separate level than cafe. Need to use a different entrance.
1221,"An accessible toilet with grab rails, room to turn, and bright and light decor is off the main corridor."
1222,"Disabled friendly,nice food, friendly staff and reasonable prices"
1223,Knowledgeable and helpful staff around the site particularly in the Mansion and Block B  
1224,"My husband and I love These cottages. Many years ago before we had the kids we came & stayed at Albany Cottage, and four years back came with some family for a New Years break in the Cholmley cottage and both times have been amazing. So much so, we are coming back with our children & family to stay for a New Years break at Scoresby cottage. The cottages have real character to them & rustically decorated throughout. The views we had from the Albany cottage I remember were amazing. All the cottages are very clean & well kept. It was very quiet there, & only a couple of miles out the main Whitby town centre. The owners, Richard & Jayne lived on site should we need them for any reason, although nothing occurred . There are log burners in the cottages we stayed which were a lovely touch, and some lighter blocks were provided.  Would recommend anyone from young couples, to larger mixed families for these cottages as it is  catered to suit everyone.  Can't wait to come back with the rest of my family & celebrate New Years again!"
1225,"Very warmly welcomed once we were allowed inside. We had to wait about 5 minutes before we were escorted inside. The queue was very long to get inside and as we were outside it was cold and windy so an inside cloakroom or waiting area would be better. The staff were friendly, helpful and tried their best to answer my questions. The male receptionist ... can’t remember his name ... was especially good! He told me and my friend about the membership scheme, encouraged us to sign up there and then, we were then able to get discount on our drinks and updates via email re future events ... both free and paid"
1226,"We visited during the Covid-19 alarm, so a one way system was operational and some minor roads were not accessible (these were mainly ones that were inaccessible to a wheelchair). Nevertheless we coped well with my wife’s wheelchair and enjoyed our visit.  NOTE: Only open from April to October.  Website: http://www.wimborne-modeltown.com/"
1227,Need to check. 
1228,"Green Park station is a few yards away an - on a good day - is fully step-free, but check before you travel, because the lifts are this station are notoriously unreliable. Zillions of buses go along Piccadilly. I don't know about parking in this area."
1229,"The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating, and treat you with the same respect as any other customer. The cats are all friendly and very curious around wheelchairs, and treat you with the usual disdain cats have for everybody. Sooty in particular is very bold and will happily climb all over you in order to satisfy his curiosity."
1230,"We have attended Glas-Denbury for several years and with young children. The festival always proves to be family friendly but also offers a brilliant time for the adults! This time we attended with our 4year old daughter who uses a walking frame and a wheelchair. She was able to use both with no issues, changing space and toilets had been considered.   Incredible to see a local festival striving to be so inclusive and accessible. The care, effort and WILLINGNESS  to develop this is really  the most important thing. This great team are clearly not trying to tick a box they are aiming to be fully  inclusive and accessible to ALL!  "
1231,Friendly and extremely obliging
1232,"Staff, if a bit slow, were extremely friendly and helpful during our visit."
1233,There is only one accessible toilet it is located next to the ladies and gents and is off to the left next to the bar area. The Wheelchair toilet is also the baby change area the toilet has grip rails on both sides and it is a bit tight and there is no room for a care giver.  
1234,"The Commonwealth Graves can be accessed through the main gate which has a large carpark adjacent . Public bus service stops in the car park May also be accessed via the river path.  Older parts of the cemetery can be accessed via the main entrance to the church via the main road, some street parking available"
1235,"Letham Glen is a great park with a few different accessible activities including large size musical instruments and a wheelchair accessible roundabout. If you have a radar key, you can also use the wheelchair accessible swing which has everything you need to feel safe and a QR code to a video that can help you get set up. It was great fun and a nice park to go to even if you don’t fancy a swing. The entrance is through a stone gateway off a roundabout but it’s really easy to get in and there is plenty of parking. "
1236,Large accessible toilet/changing area. Hoist and plinth.
1237,cant do enough to assist
1238,"Just to say that at the moment the lift does not work at Holmfirth Library, and the disabled toilet is on the first floor. There is no plan to mend the lift.  Computers and reference library are also on the first floor.  There is ramp access to the ground floor of the Library.Tourist information, walking room and lending Library are accessible on ground floor.    Nearest changing place facilities are at Cliffe House , Shepley:  for opening times:   en-gb.facebook.com/cliffehouse.  It may also be possible to use facilities at Rowan Court, Hollybanks, Holmfirth, but it would be necessary to contact Rowan Court first."
1239,"Step-free access into the café and most tables are wheelchair-friendly. The counter is very high, which is emphatically *not* wheelchair-friendly. There's only just enough space to move around, as the tables are very close together. Customers are cooperative about making space, so this is not an insurmountable problem."
1240,Not enough room for 2 carers to help onto toilet but in our case our son could use the grab handles to help stand up.
1241,"The festival is held at Mote Park, Maidstone.   Reasonably easy to get around, grassland with few slopes and walkways by carparks.  It rained most of the day on Saturday but did not become too muddy."
1242,"The access to the building was around the side, down a cobbled street. You gain access through ringing the door bell which was answered quickly by the staff. "
1243,"Very small carpark with only one official disabled spot. Bit of a slope and a big gate to enter the Ponds, so a lone wheelchair user would need assistance. "
1244,"A small step at the main entrance, which proved to be of no trouble to us, and the ground floor is mainly flat, easy for you to see what you need to see. However, you would not really benefit fully of the use of the wonderful garden areas, because of the many steps that await you. But if like us, you visit to enjoy a delightful light lunch, just a selection of lovely sandwiches, and coffee or hot chocolate, then it truly is an elegant experience, well worth the effort to just enjoy being pampered for a change."
1245,"Suitable for the wheelchair to entre.  Adequate grab rails, easy access to sink and dryer.  Includes baby change fascility.  However the toilet seat moved and was not secure."
1246,"The French do not tolerate anyone , who is not disabled and displaying a blue badge to park in a designated disabled place. We have a large hydraulic rear ramp van and never have any trouble parking at anywhere we wish to go."
1247,The car park has many parking spaces close to the entrance. Close to bus stops. The staff are friendly and polite so if you need any help they will assist you.    
1248,"I'm familiar with the museum and the exhibition was well signposted so I made straight to the exhibition.  After the exhibition I went to the information desk at the entrance and asked to speak to someone about access. The 2 members of staff of the desk her extremely helpful. They listened to my request and called the duty manager. The manager came within a couple of minutes. They all actively listened to my feedback and the duty manager volunteered to escalate this so that managers could be aware of this for future planning and also consider it for the new museum building which will be located in Smithfield, which will be near to Farringdon station which is step free.  Staff were excellent. I genuinely felt that they took on board what I raised and that my feedback would was valuable.  The staff in the canteen were helpful."
1249,could benefit from wet floor showers
1250,There is a long ramp down to the entrance and then a lift down to the lower floor.
1251,There is parking (three or four disabled) all along the street that the restaurant is on and it is situated a five-minute walk from the bus station and the train station is about ten minutes away. 
1252,See above
1253,"Four stars for Queen Street as we didn't have to ask for assistance or go looking for someone to help when we came to make the return journey. We were met on the concourse by the barriers and asked if we require assistance.  The ramps were quickly produced to board the train, the seats adjusted to make room for our two powerchairs, and checks made to ensure that our destination station would be ready to help us when we get there."
1254,Staff helpful and nice. 
1255,Parking is on gravel but gives way to hard metalled pathways
1256,Staff were very helpful and explained about the disabled access at the other end of the grounds. They also said that if i needed any help for future visits if i rang in advance they could help with any access problems.
1257,"The staff are very friendly, Helpful, and happy to talk."
1258,"Probably the best the reviewer has encountered in a pub/ restaurant setting. Uses radar key, available on request "
1259,Staff were very helpful and friendly.
1260,There was no parking for this building. Meaning you have to walk/go in a wheelchair quite a distance from the nearest parking place.
1261,Fully equipped and well serviced.
1262,Wonderfully large wet room and toilet 
1263,"This location is very accessible. The seating area for wheelchair uses is very large with fixed seating for Carers / friends. There is a changing places toilet, but, this was only advertised in the usual accessible toilet which I wouldn't normally go in I only went in to change my tshirt!!!!"
1264,"Sadly access into this cafe isn't great. There is a hefty set of steps up into the cafe (they are decorated with plants and flowers), and once inside the toilets are back downstairs again (at least the ladies toilets are).   Inside, the cafe is super colourful and bright. I took my nephew once who just loved the colours and quirky decor. There's also a small train model that, if I remember correctly, starts its journey when the door to the men's toilets is opened!   The surfaces and colours mean that this cafe is full of contrasts which is good for perception. "
1265,One or two bumpy sections. The Water of Leith Visitor Centre at the end of the walk is fully accessible and a good place for a cuppie and a cake.
1266,"This is a National Trust property near Brixham. It has a shop, restaurant, house and gardens.  Unfortunately it's on a steep hill running down to the sea.  They have 2 manual wheelchairs available to borrow, but as its a steep site, you'll be restricted to the top gardens, restaurant and shop - unless you have a very strong wheelchair 'pusher'.  They told us that they've tried several mobility scooters on the site but they couldn't cope with the steepness of the site, but they were still looking. Even getting to the house is hard going, as is the terrace and upper gardens. There is no wheelchair access to the upper floor of the house, and numerous steps make even the ground floor tricky. The shop and restaurant (easy access in a wheelchair) are on a level with the entrance and loos. A nice unexpected bonus (not really an accessibility issue, but one of our party is gluten free) - though it's not publicised in the restaurant - is that all sandwiches are available on gluten free bread, many of the main dishes can easily be made gf, and there are gf cakes available. "
1267,Got a pass to come via my sons asn group. We couldn’t make the date  due to the weather and jasmine was amazing let us go later in the wk. My son didn’t really want to get out the car but eventually did. What a wonderful tranquil place to be. Beautiful animals. Wonderful owners and staff and whilst we weren’t there long we were made to feel so welcome it put us at ease which is great when u have a child with autism and learning disabilities- my son was able to be himself.  Bought some duck eggs mmmmm delicious defo recommend x x
1268,All areas wheelchair accessible
1269,Takes a while to get their attention. 
1270,"Verdant Works was probably the highlight of our trip to Dundee. It tells the fascinating story of jute and mills in Dundee. One volunteer called Lily shared her experiences of working in the mill when she was a young girl - amazing! Overall access is fairly good, although it is an old building and bumpy in places."
1271,"We were in our own car and used disabled parking spaces with my blue badge.  These were generally easy to find, but not numerous.  We also used the ferries on the lake; these were able to take my powerchair, and had lifts to get access to all levels."
1272,"Just back from the Hydro. This venue is huge, therefore, anyone with mobility issues will really struggle. Despite numerous food outlets, there are no seats at all where people can sit and eat. I spoke with a couple both of whom have MS, like myself. They sat on the stairs but were moved on by staff. There was nowhere for them to go other than into the concert hall itself. This is far from ideal. I heard many complaints from elderly, infirm and disabled people about the difficulties they were having in this venue."
1273,"Great food, very friendly and helpful staff,  Tables high enough for power chair. Had their own ramp which was in place on our arrival.  Plenty of space to move around and manoeuvre a power chair.  Fantastic.  Will be returning soon."
1274,"All rooms  ie bedroom,  lounge, kitchen, and bathroom fully accessible for manual  wheelchair user. Also good access to patio area."
1275,There is a carpark for the football club next door which offers a level pathway to the ramped side door but spaces are minimal and on street parking is always jam packed.
1276,"an Italian restaurant, it's one of three Andiamo's in the Glasgow area. "
1277,"Excellent., all on Street level, ramps situated where required, in the wet though the paving can be a bit slippery."
1278,ramps and lifts available with plenty of space to move around.
1279,In an awkward place at a junction parking not great as always busy / occupied
1280,The loo in the bathroom is a bit low so it might be useful to bring a portable toilet seat raiser on holiday. A walking frame or rollater would make getting on and off the loo easier.  But I managed using the wash basin which is next to the toilet.
1281,Crathes is on the main Royal Deeside road from Aberdeen. We arrived by car and after approaching along the tree lined drive we swept in to a large car park. Looking for accessible parking bays for our WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) we spotted the sign for disabled parking. We drove past the Castle and on around to the dedicated parking at the back of the gift shop. 
1282,Not the best views. Lifts might be small for some people. Signage hard to read.
1283,It was just unreal to see Concorde. I had never seen it before - to actually see it face to face was amazing. It was just huge. It would have been nice to be able to go inside but I couldn't with the wheelchair. 
1284,Plenty of flat areas and paths that are wheelchair friendly. 
1285,There are accessible toilets adjacent to the children's play area and the Ross Bandstand.
1286,Downstairs large bathroom and wide door. Wet room and shower chair suitable for  the disabled.
1287,I often come here to see exhibitions or meet friends in the cafe 
1288,This is an old theatre (1901) but is very wheelchair and disabled friendly. There is a side entrance on Commercial Street which allows a flat entrance to the stalls. It is also the easiet place to be dropped off/ picked up. Lower number seats are nearer that entrance and disabled toilet. Staff will do anything they can to help you. There are wheelchair spaces. You need to contact the box office by phone to book these and often you can get a free carer entry too.
1289,Access to the station is good is you arrive by taxi. If you're a pedestrian it can be challenging to work out where the lifts are.
1290,"There are two entrances, we used the one on Commercial Street which had ramped access. Useful to have a second pair of hands to hold the doors open. Restaurant itself is easy to navigate and it was very easy to move furniture to suit our party."
1291,"Please see photos. These were stylish, clean, well-sized and well equipped. Far superior to your average accessible loo."
1292,Parked on the drive which is flat. Bus goes along the road outside.
1293,"New Look is generally fairly accessible throughout. Level entrance. The front door is 1645mm wide, and is generally open. In winter only one door is open so it’s about 800mm wide. There is no bell or knocker for assistance on the front door, but they have them in the fitting rooms. They used to have a hearing induction loop but couldn’t find it. The till height is 1010mm. There are no Braille aids. There is seating available. There is no toilet, the nearest disabled toilet is in Costa Coffee a few doors down. We have not uploaded any photos as New Look need to check with their Head Office."
1294,The staff were very accommodating and happy to answer our questions.  We were made very welcome.
1295,Amazing access into St Paul's Cathedral and around when inside.
1296,I don’t know about parking but as S Charlotte Street is just off Princes St there are many many bus options and stops to get off at and the paths are level to the shop.
1297,"Can't say much about parking, but public transport is good. The synagogue is in a very central location with lots of buses passing by. "
1298,"Great little pub style restaurant. Ok, so it's a chain, but I love the quirky mash up interior non matching chairs and tables.  Easy access from the main A85 and the moment you go inside you quickly forget it's right on the main road.  Lots of easy parking right outside the front door and no steps or uneven surfaces to worry about. Inside is a little dark, but that's kinda the appeal.  The tables are set out with a good amount of space around them, enough that a wheelchair wouldn't seem in the way.  We went on a Sunday so indulged in their carvery.  Food was yummy, lovely roast beef will the all important home made Yorkshire pudding and lashings of gravy.  Staff were great, chatty and friendly but not in the annoying way.  Will definitely be back."
1299,The pub is a few minutes walk from Cutty Sark DLT step free station. 
1300,the station is at the top of a hill which is quite steep doors are automatic and open wide enough
1301,Staff  are friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. 
1302,Access is at the front of the shop at street level through 2 large swing doors.
1303,Some on street parking is available if you have a Blue Badge. There's also some parking in the nearby Grassmarket area.
1304,The lift was broken when we visited. The cobbles outside could be tricky but inside the museum there were ramps and level floors
1305,"I did not use any parking facility as I went by train. There are plenty of buses in the town, a good taxi service but only a 20 minute walk from the station. "
1306,We used a wheelchair taxi organised by Accessible Travel Netherlands to get us from the ferry terminal at Ijmuiden to Amsterdam Centraal Station. Drop off is very convenient and that station has lift access to all platforms.
1307,"Generally good. We saw power chair users whizzing over tram tracks & cobbles. The gardens of the Schloss are fully wheelchair accessible, as is the promenade along the river, which leads to a pleasant riverside walk (gravel, paving-stones, occasional cobbles) with several accessible routes back into the historic centre."
1308,All the staff where very approachable and helpful when in need. 
1309,"We enjoyed our journey to the hotel, the driveway itself was most welcoming, and we found two bays right up by hotels entrance ideal for disabled."
1310,Disabled parking close to cafe.
1311,"There is no Disabled Parking at the Grand Theatre, the theatre does have any!  The only Disabled parking near by and metres away too, is either on-street disabled parking bays, check with Blackpool Council, or off-road disabled parking in public car parks again metres away too."
1312,"Getting to the entrance can take time due to some steps that have to be avoided. Once you  get to the entrance the lift is just inside the doorway. This takes you down to a smooth corridor with acees to the theatre/performance area and to the disabled toilets. I was lead to a space suitable to park my scooter, but due to the samll number of seats and demand for the performance I had to stay on my scooter."
1313,"This is a handy train station as there are regular trains throughout the day that go to Glasgow Central. However, we found that this train station was not accessible for people in wheelchairs as the only entrance to the station is via a set of stairs.   We got the train to Glasgow Central at 8:14. This train was very busy and a lot of people had to stand; there was not a lot of space to move when standing. For a wheelchair user, this may not be a pleasant journey.   Furthermore, there is a gap between the platform and the train itself; without a ramp, this would make it difficult for a wheelchair user to get on the train.   Overall, this train station is not very accessible for wheelchair users. "
1314,"Lots of buses serve the area, but the nearest tube station, Clapham Common, is crassly inaccessible, reachable only via steep flights of stairs. "
1315,Came by car. Disabled spaces.
1316,"All we met, mainly in shops, were friendly enough so no problems."
1317,Wetherspoons have gone the extra mile and installed an external lift from street level
1318,"The Invercarse Hotel has great accessible parking, especially for being a hotel. There are 4 accessible parking spaces beside the main entrance and there is also an accessible parking space outside each accessible bedroom.   Dundee train station is roughly a 7-minute drive away from the Invercarse Hotel and there are plenty of taxis around Dundee. Buses also go by the Invercarse Hotel frequently as it is situated on the Perth Road which is a main road that runs from the city centre."
1319,Jane and Stuart the owner's are always near by and happy to help
1320,Staff in the shop and inside the stadium are very helpful and friendly. As it is a league 2 club ( although they should be promoted this year) all the staff get to know supporters who go regularly there is a happy friendly family feel about the stadium
1321,I didn't speak to any staff.
1322,"We have stayed at the Grand previously and had a really good experience - unfortunately this time was disappointing. One of our party is in a wheelchair . We booked an accessible room and gave them advance notice that a wheelchair user would be staying. Unfortunately whilst the lift at the disabled entrance worked well the doors to the hotel were all locked and unbeknown to us the bell for disabled customers to ring to notify staff that they had arrived was out of order. We waited half an hour in the wind and rain - we eventually called reception and they sent someone 15 minutes later. We also had difficulty exiting the building- the door was simply too heavy for us to open and there were no staff available to help. One of our party had to go to the concierge desk - they eventually came round to help.   We spoke to the Duty Manager and he could not have cared less. He said the doors had been closed because of the poor weather and had no explanation for why the broken bell had not been fixed or why there wasn’t a sign saying it wasn’t working. A couple (not wheelchair users) also tried to use the entrance and he seemed more concerned with them and their experience. We paid nearly £1,000 to stay one night: the least they could do is help us to access the building.   Once inside the building it was easy to get around- but it was humiliating waiting in the wind and rain, and we were left drenched and feeling unwellcome."
1323,Accessible loo at Wetton Mill tearoom.   It was spacious and reasonably well kitted out (though I seem recall the loo was quite low).  Bit of a lip to wheel over to access the loo block. Not radar key operated. No facilities at Weags Bridge.
1324,Access all level and great lift with mirrored wall so you could reverse out easily. Each floor had a large lobby with floor length windows for a great view of the city
1325,Everything to close!
1326,Flat access
1327,"The loos in the bar area are lovely, not changing places but plenty large enough for large wheelchair, user and carer. Space for transfer made a nice change. Spotlessly clean!   The only thing is that the accessible loos are in the main toilet area... I didn't look but assume another accessible cubicle in the gents.  Would make mixed sex user/client a bit of an issue for some."
1328,"Very accessible property, hugely helpful owners and a lovely comfortable place to stay in a beautiful part of the UK"
1329,Excellent access. Flat entry and within. Enough space to use wheelchair or rollator within. Wet room. Alexa technology.
1330,No lift or accessible rooms upstairs. 
1331,"Drop off here is a nightmare if you're a wheelchair user as there isn't enough space in the drop off area. Getting a black cab from the rank is a physical impossibility as some idiot designed the rank to have a dropped kerb which simply does not work with the ramps on the hackney carriages. You end up meeting the cab driver around the corner, not fun when you're tired from traveling. It simply should not be that hard."
1332,"There is a train station in South Queensferry  (Dalmenay), which is about a 10 minute walk from the Bistro. It is downhill going to the Bistro, but walking or pushing going back up the hill to the station might be harder!  We came by car, there is a large car park directly across the road from the Bistro, with several marked disabled bays."
1333,"Great secure parking, car park accessed via a coded electric gate. Owners let us unload at side of cottages for ease. Disabled parking clearly signed."
1334,"Easy and step-free access into the venue. Staff then escorted us to the lift and up to the accessible balcony area. At least two wheelchairs and several companions can fit in the lift as it is quite spacious.  The accessible balcony area is at the back of the room close to the accessible toilet. At first, I thought it was a great spot as there wasn't a lot of people around and there was a retractable tape barrier around the accessible area. Once we got positioned we realised the balcony railing was right across our eye-level which meant we couldn't see the stage. This was very frustrating. We had to bend our necks down to see under the railing, which I couldn't do as it hurt my neck too much.   If you are a powered wheelchair user with a rising function then you will have no issues and get a fantastic view. Otherwise, you won't see much of the stage. "
1335,"As a young Sheffield United fan I want to travel to away matches to back my team and Chesterfield was next on the list! I am unfortunately confined to a wheelchair and away grounds can sometimes seem daunting experiences: where is the accessible parking, where are the seats, are they accessible, where are there disabled toilets etc.? Supporting your team is a great feeling (especially when you win) and with an understanding of the problems you might encounter, I want to share my experiences of football grounds with you so you can feel a bit more confident about stadium accessibility in the future. "
1336,"The accessible toilet is huge, I could do doughnuts in my wheelchair! There a only two bins which really makes a difference too."
1337,"Level access, automatic electric doors.  Wheelchair accessible trolleys are located inside. Mobility scooters & manual wheelchairs available.  They also have the small metal baskets.  Hearing loops were available according to signs.   I didn't see any designated accessible tills. Not much space at scan and go tills.   The shelving and fridges/freezers were typical of supermarkets and difficult to access. The scales for fruit and veg was really high.   No music but they do have a tannoy system.  The lift to up stairs is at back of store inside the Argos. "
1338,Entrance to the Pleasance courtyard there are no dropped kerbs so if you are in a powered wheelchair you really need to stay on the road to access it. Once in the courtyard it is pretty much accessible although it is cobbled stones so is a little uneven and the ticket office is up a couple of steps but if you speak to staff they are generally very helpful. access to theatre was via a wheelchair lift to level 3 through a staff only entrance. There is an accessible toilet next to the bar as you enter the building.
1339,No disabled parking but a prime location for Princes street public transport.
1340,Have always found the staff friendly and helpful.
1341,"A modern restaurant with good wheelchair access, right across from the concert hall. Although it's on quite a hill, there is a solid ramp on the side and the camber is not too bad. There is outside seating available at the front of the restaurant where you can take in the atmosphere if you would prefer.   Inside the glass door, the restaurant is spacious, on the one level and with a range of different seating options, you need not feel like second thought. Plenty of room to move around in a wheelchair.   Plenty of food choice and food quality was quite good. Quiet enough to have a decent conversation and didn't feel too rushed.   Overall, I enjoyed my visit and would return. "
1342,"Two accessible toilets, one on the ground floor and another on the dress circle level."
1343,"The Theatre Royal has been refurbished and is now more accessible, including automatic doors and the foyer more spacious. The stalls are now raked but the first few rows are step-free (I rang before buying tickets to get advice on this) and there are designated wheelchair spaces in the stalls and Dress Circle, which you can now access by lift. The new Colonnade Café is in the foyer area so is accessible and there is a bar at Dress Circle level too. The only real issue is that, once seated at the end of a row (we were in row C) thee was no room for people to get past. They obligingly went round a different way or carefully stepped  over but we realised that the end seat in row B doesn't have a seat in front, so would be a better choice - the same applies at both ends of the row I'm pretty sure. I was able to leave my scooter against the nearby wall as it wasn't blocking anyone but it is very small, a larger one might need to be stored elsewhere - again, a phone call would be a good idea, the staff are very helpful. They also do BSL interpreted and audio described performances."
1344,St. Paul's as an older building has worked hard to make as much accessible as possible. The experience was great and the staff extremely helpful.
1345,"We had a delicious family meal at this restaurant but although there is good level access to the restaurant, the unisex toilets were small for a wheelchair user and without support bars. There was a step between this restaurant and the larger function room which, I was told, did have a proper disabled toilet attached.  To reach this, I would have to go outside and in via another entrance.  I did not explore this option, preferring to go home. "
1346,Easy to get around with lift to basement and balcony. When used for events as well as services the building is very accessible. Screens around the main area can display text and information.
1347,"There is no specific parking for the venue. We used the nearby Grand Arcade's parking, which gives 3hours free when you scan your Blue Badge.  Cambridge is renowned for its parking being very limited and expensive. There's a lot of bus stops relatively nearby, although accessibility varies."
1348,Excellent 
1349,"Friendly, helpful and proactive."
1350,The front entrance has a little bit of a lip to get up a curb but it is pretty easy to do it in my powerchair with a bit of Run up.  All floors are level access and accessible by a lift. You need a key card to use the lift which you can get from the bouncers. It's good that they have a key card because it stops able-bodied people from using the lift.  In the club rooms it can get very crowded on club nights so I tend to just sit in one place. It's difficult to drive through the crowds without running over someone.  They also tend to do flashing strobe lights a lot so if anybody has epilepsy it's probably not advisable to go there.  
1351,"Whilst there was ample parking for disabled badge holders, there was no lines on the car park, which meant there was no guarantee of space being kept for the wheelchair on return. Whilst there were examples of cars parked rather close to other cars, fortunately for me my space was near the edge of the car park, however had I been further into the parking, I could envisage some major problems getting back into the car.  It was a long walk from the disabled parking to the main entrance as the full length of the parking had a physical barrier, therefore you'd have to leave the disabled parking, and then double back and walk the equivalent of the full length of the car park in the opposite direction to reach the entrance gates. So whilst a car can be parked as little as 40 metres from the entrance, you would have to walk 180 metres to get from there to the entrance.  The surface of the car park is compacted gravel, whilst the wheelchair went over this okay, it isn't the easiest of surfaces for wheelchairs."
1352,"Some thought has gone into making the ICA wheelchair-friendly, but there are a few things still not quite right, and the upstairs bar cannot be reached in a wheelchair, which is very disappointing."
1353,"Great night out for a change, great atmosphere. Enjoying some drinks, chatting and trying to win some money."
1354,"Friendly and helpful. When I couldn't find the toilet, someone accompanied me all the way there and held a door open for me."
1355,The whole of the quayside was step free and you could wheel right on to the bridge... there’s different lanes for pedestrians or a dual lane for pedestrians and bikes. Lots of spots to take a picture and great in the sunshine!
1356,"Just the fact that someone has bothered to build ramp access up to the static caravan is a fantastic start, because a lot of the trouble with camping for people with impaired mobility is not being able to clamber up into campervans or get up from the floor of tents. But with this place you can stay in the caravan and come and go just like everyone else.   Indeed, in some ways what you get is better than everyone else: one of the staff members told me he thought the accessible caravan is the nicest one on the park, because it's been adapted from a rather tightly-packed three-bedroom caravan to one with two bigger bedrooms and a bigger bathroom, so it's more spacious and comfortable for the visitors. Also, it's in a great location on the edge of the caravan park so the views from some of the windows are straight across the fields to the mountains.  The bathroom has a loo with rails and a shower with a (non-wobbly) wheeled shower seat and hose you can hold. The kitchen was also reasonably spacious for a caravan, and I was able to do some washing up sitting sideways on my scooter.  Almost every other building in the Glen Nevis Holidays complex was accessible too, including the neighbouring bar and restaurant and the supermarket in the campsite down the road. The only slight shame was that the laundry room on the self-catering park had a big step up to it so I couldn't go in.  One more thing to recommend: there's a mile-long accessible path along the river opposite the self-catering park (cross the bridge near the youth hostel), so you can even get properly out into the countryside with your scooter or wheelchair. I was told that some previous visitors had even attempted some trickier paths by hiring off-road scooters from Shopmobility Lochaber in Fort William. "
1357,"This year due to covid19, there are not so many accessible public toilets in Javea. However at the El Arenal beach  most restaurants have access to a disabled access toilet."
1358,"I am a wheelchair user and had my birthday party. We did canoeing. It was great fun. They have a kayak with stabilisers which I could use and my friends and family where in other kayaks and canoes. We learnt some basics skills and then when for a river trip. The centre is completely accessible, I could even get upstairs to make myself a cup of tea. Considering it is an old dutch barn they have adapted it really well. I noticed they have an accessible wetroom , toilet and a changing table and hoist. I really loved their attitude, they were very friendly and didn't treat me any differently. They took my lead but supported me getting in and out of the kayak which was really nice.  I really recommend this."
1359,"Only really accessible by car. Given the high proportion of seniors demographically, there is need for more disabled parking spaces."
1360,"The venue is found just before St Helens Village and is on a bus route with an hourly bus service. It is reached by way of a small winding, uphill lane from the main road. Arriving by car is easier and there is a good sized carpark. "
1361,Friendly and very helpful.
1362,"It's a good large and clean loo. It's quite some way from the cafe and centre, cross the car park. It has a parking space outside.  Unfortunately it's located on the far side of the toilet block with absolutely no signage to say there's a disabled loo until you get right round the back. Looking over from the cafe, you can see the huge male and female loo symbols - there should be an accessible loo sign too!   That said, there's an adult changing table as well in there. There's a red alarm cord but it's finger grips are missing."
1363,"Level access, door opens to outside. There is limited space and seating. I was able to squeeze past people in a powerchair when its busy but would be even easier if quiter. Dogs are allowed in. Did not see any signage for toilet but it is past the bar at the back on the right hand side. No key required. "
1364,The whole complex bar one small area was step free. Access was excellent. 
1365,"Its on a one-way street, which can get quite busy. There is a place for taxis to pull in and drop people off."
1366,"The visitor experience was limited by the restrictions of the current pandemic so there were no talks scheduled. However there were plenty of volunteers around to answer questions. The arrangements for social distancing were well thought out, with hand sanitizer at the point of entry for each new area. Each area was interesting and the tropical house was arranged to educate evolution of species. Loved it."
1367,Welcoming and helpful.
1368,Parking is always tricky here and this year it was worse due to the building works going on. Would be a huge help to have some more accessible parking spaces.
1369,"As you would expect from this 1 starred Michelin restaurant the food is truly excellent and comes at a price but is not totally stratospheric (£240 for 2 for taster menu, quite a lot of wine and tip). My wife went in her electric chair. Access is good but there is no disabled loo.  Would recommend as long as you can use a normal loo or hold it! We would go again."
1370,There were two sets of automatic doors and flat access. No seats in foyer.
1371,There is level access to reception from the entrance but the desk doesn't have a low section.  The lighting levels are low for ambience so beware of people's ankles. For hearing aid users a bad mark as there is not a hearing loop system.
1372,"Many shops in older buildings still have steps (Accessorize, £-Stretcher etc.) and some that have ramps are too steep to climb in a manual wheelchair without help as you tip over backwards. Some shops are far too cramped for anything larger than a wheelchair and you would struggle if you needed to stay on board a scooter (BHS, WHSmith, The Works etc). Some stores like Primark though are very good and even provide accessible tills, Morrissons are very good and have always helped me greatly. So overall a bit hit and miss."
1373,Accessible toilet in Starbucks cafe for customers.
1374,Everywhere was easily accessible.
1375,"Since the refit the main entrance is no longer up the steep stone steps, there are still there for decorative purposes, or to watch street performers outside but the main entrance is now disabled friendly, silver buttons and much wider which is awesome. It's pretty dark to start with but once your eyes adjust it's ok.  Throughout the whole building disabled access is possible but people are not always considerate, my family always make sure someone is with me to make sure noone is walking over me or in front of me so I can enjoy this trip fully. "
1376,"Great Pub with great staff, all customers are treated equally.  All access is wheelchair friendly.  Staff will go the extra mile.  Lots of room inside, all amenities are on ground level.  Lovely beer garden."
1377,The Wallace Collection is conveniently located in Central London. We were staying nearby so just tootled along - but it’s not too far from major transport routes.
1378,"Very sweet-natured and friendly staff. Half a star lost because the one person I spoke to about the toilet emergency cord didn't really 'get' it, despite my clear and thorough explanation. A whole star lost because of the utter silliness of stacking chairs to block the route to the accessible toilet."
1379,"Hotel has own car park, it is a bit small but we had no problems"
1380,"The toilet *is* accessible, but only just.  A larger wheelchair would be difficult to manoeuvre, but they have obviously tried very hard to make it as accessible as possible."
1381,"Relatively easy to find ,could have with more given the amount of people there "
1382,Access to the Gardens as a wheelchair user was a bit tricky. Once I found the level access from Kings Stables Road life became easier.
1383,"Great food in a great area of Glasgow, but despite the best efforts of the staff it was let down by poor access."
1384,No steps but quite narrow door. I can get through in a Quckie Salsa chair.
1385,Access to and within ground floor very good. Front door is heavy!
1386,Needed help from staff in Restaurant + Castle - were supportive and very willing to help in any way.
1387,Beautiful building. One accessible bedroom on 1st floor reached by a lift. Stairs to restaurant and bar but staff will bring a folding ramp. Bathroom in the bedroom has 2 grab rails at the toilet but has a bath so I couldn't use it. 
1388,"An excellent accessible toilet, but one thing really spoils it: the red emergency cord has been tied up so that it ends well over a metre above floor level. Anyone who falls out of their wheelchair (not unusual when transferring to a toilet) will be left stranded with no means of summoning assistance. I'm subtracting three stars for this because it's really dreadfully ignorant and dangerous to hang the cord so high."
1389,"The car park is gravel, which I find it hard to walk on. The scooter managed it OK though. There were a couple of low steps at the entrance (each an inch or so high). Staff were eager to help and although there was no ramp I had no bother getting in on the scooter with a wee shove!"
1390,"I'm not 100% sure if there was parking available at this hotel, however there was plenty ssteet parking for taxis to drop passangers off right outside the entrance of the hotel. There was also a taxi rank/accessible tram stop a short wheel up from the hotel should you require one to venture further into town."
1391,"Broughton Street is on a slope, so the front entrance has a step that is on a gradient. Plenty of room within the cafe."
1392,"Signage good (it also had braille), flat entrance so no need for ramp. Wide doors so easily accessible for weelchairs."
1393,"Parkgate retail park is located just outside of Rotherham town center and includes numerous shops, such as New Look, River Island, Asda Living and many more, and several restaurants such as Frankie and Benny's and Pizza hut. The shops are located in two parallel rows, with the large car park in between which is almost divided into two by the road through the center. There are two zebra crossings to facilitate safe crossing of the often busy road. There are ramps rather than steps down the banking to the car park s for improved accessibility."
1394,"The museum is housed in a former home with traditional architecture with an open air courtyard. There is a ramp at the entrance to the museum. The museum itself is on 2 floors with the upper floor being accessible by stairs or a lift. There was a basement room, which is open to the public but I was unable to access due to the stairs. There was another lift from the courtyard to the shop/ exit.  Then one shallow step from the shop to street level. Overall I was very impressed and surprised with the installation of lift given that it is a historic property. There were cards in each of the rooms in different languages telling you about the things in the room but I was not aware if they did large print or braille."
1395,"everywhere fully accessible.  Lifts to all floors, and in the dining room (waiter operated, but always a friendly waiter on hand) Entrance door with button for opening"
1396,"What was once an old potting shed is today a tearoom serving up incredible cake. The tearoom and garden are tucked away along a single track road surrounded by woodland and wildlife. There's step-free access, but it is a bit tight for space inside the tearoom."
1397,On street parking. Not many drop curbs. Stockbridge is pretty central and close to bus stops but some streets are cobbled.
1398,Loo with handrails in women's bathroom
1399,"Very good, but cannot accommodate power chairs. "
1400,Very helpful staff; who can help allocate and guide people if they need assistance.
1401,"Disabled facilities in 4 rooms, good public disabled toilet. Well signposted, easy to find."
1402,"See above.  The wheelchair spaces are in boxes at the rear of the stalls, easy to access and with good sightlines and very comfortable chairs for non wheelchair users."
1403,Staff at the entrance where very nice. 
1404,Very helpful.
1405,"Accessible parking is near to the Visitor Centre entrance. Once tickets are purchased the staff ring through the house staff and warn them you are coming. You can then drive to the house, as opposed to using the normal shuttle bus service, where the staff let you in at a separate entrance."
1406,Level access from large tarmac car park - tarmac somewhat uneven but all negotiable; .also bus stops nearby
1407,"When we arrived at the Esplanade we were told that the disabled spaces were full but they arranged for my husband to drop me off as close to the entrance as possible then he went and parked the car. As I have a blue badge parking was free. Staff radioed for the courtesy car to take me up to the highest point of the castle. The driver , Jerry, was incredibly helpful and pointed out where we could go.  The main rooms are all accessible and there is a lift up to the Stirling Heads exhibition. We could also access the great hall which has a disabled toilet (See photo)  We ran out of time so didn't go into the cafes or round the grounds."
1408,"There were tables blocking parts of the ground floor making it difficult for me to get around myself, but the corridors were wide enough to allow me to pass people."
1409,In the main concourse of the west stand it is before the bars once you are through the entrance. It's a cubicle large enough to rotate my power chair and has been clean each time I have been to the ground.
1410,Friendly and helpful.
1411,Ramp access on/off the bus. Two wheelchair spaces with display screens (subtitled commentary). Quantum wheelchair securement system to safely hold wheelchair users in place. 
1412,Parking and public transport facilities are the same as for Derby Intu. The entrance to Eagle Market is a short walk from Derby Bus Station and the taxi rank. Shop Mobility is also attached to the Eagle Market.
1413,"Tottenham Court Road station is fully step-free street-to-train (Northern Line) and street-to-platform (Central Line - for this line wheelchair users should make sure you inform staff before you travel, as they will need to deploy manual boarding ramps).   Always check the lift status at Tottenham Court Road Station before you travel - the lifts there, although brand new, are notoriously unreliable. This station is referred to by TfL as one of its group of twenty stations with 'rogue lifts', as if somehow it's the lifts that are at fault, not TfL for keeping them in a shoddy state of maintenance.   Absurd to even dream about parking in Covent Garden.   Plenty of bus routes will drop you off a few blocks away in Charing Cross Road or Strand."
1414,There are steps leading to the front entrance however there is a wheelchair accessible entrance with push buttons to open the doors around the side of the venue. 
1415,"A wheelchair accessible holiday cottage with wonderful views and great wildlife.  Rose Cottage at Bluebell Croft was warm, with underfloor heating and log burner.  The kitchen had everything you needed, especially a washing machine and tumble dryer.  The accessible bedroom was comfy and bright, the en-suite was large with a roll-in shower.  A really lovely place to stay, we are already planning when to return."
1416,the restaurant is very popular however the staff (in my opinion) could be benefit from disbaility awareness training
1417,There was a lift up to the main doors but didn't use it as mum managed steps by using the rail. Theatre staff found a chair for mum to sit on before main theatre open ended. Lift up to our seats which were close by
1418,All lovely - lady at the cafe carried my tray to a table for me
1419,The venue is on Two levels with the exhibition being on the ground floor and the training facility being on the lower ground there is a lift available to cover this if required. The main exhibition area has a lot of space and it was easy to move around and the lighting in the exhibition was also good however some areas are slightly darker to protect the item on display such as the paper on which John Lennon wrote the words of Strawberry fields. The garden area has long wide paths that take you round the garden as you continue to follow the story. There are a number of large stones from the original wall in places in the garden that are being used as seats.  
1420,There are only a few steps and is a mini-lift/stairlift you can use. Once up the steps it is flat throughout. The toilets are a long walk unless you have a radar key to use the short cut door.
1421,"Overall really welcoming staff.  Upstairs is a bar, downstairs is the restaurant.  But they have a lift to get you down.  Argentinian food may not not be my favourite.  Nice food, but not out of this world for me."
1422,staff in and around the canal are extremely friendly and happy to help
1423,"As this is a general review of the area visited there were many accessible toilets, well signposted, clean and tidy, big enough to take a scooter straight in. I did not come across any changing places toilets at all."
1424,"Staff were really friendly, helpful, and accommodating."
1425,There's a lift from the car park up to floor seven. I only deducted half a star for heavy doors /from the lift lobby. Staff by the door to the restaurant quickly opened those doors for us.  Once inside manoeuvring was fine for a wheelchair.  There was plenty if room even though it was very busy.
1426,Our waitress was excellent and the male behind reception was attentive and helpful. 
1427,There is a manned reception desk as you come in and the staff were very helpful.  They actually have access surveys to fill in and leave with comments.
1428,"Was relatively easy to get into the zoo as a manual wheelchair user, although the doors were a bit heavy. The paths around the zoo are mostly smooth concrete, but be aware there are very few flat areas - basically slopes everywhere! Some of the paths were incredibly steep to the point that my partner was either struggling to push me up them or clinging onto my push handles for dear life as we went down. I would not advise a manual wheelchair user to try and self propel around the zoo themselves unless they had extremely good upper body strength. Take someone to push you or use power! "
1429,"Very friendly, polite and efficient."
1430,Very attentive and friendly without being overpowering. True Irish charm and humour all added to the positive experience.
1431,"We arrived by car on a surprisingly busy Wednesday during holidays. The overflow parking on the way in was full; with cones to discourage drivers continuing to the main car park.   The overflow parking appeared (and is) some distance from the Kelpies, so we took a chance and drove round the cones. The main car park was also full with an attendant operating a 1 in 1 out system.   After a 20min wait we were sent round to the empty coach parking to give us more space for the wheelchair. They also waived the £2 charge (think overflow was free to all). Shame we had to wait but no biggie really."
1432,"I had been to the links bar many times so I was interested to see what it looked like after the black ivy had taken it over. A friend and I went there for a drink. What a change! It looks really smart and classy. The black ivy is wheelchair accessible and has a disabled toilet. On the night it was particularly quiet probably because there was a snow storm forecast and it was a week night. There are large screens for watching sport. They sometimes have live music (see photo of piano etc) and I believe you can also play ping pong for free on their tennis tables. We had a lovely evening drinking cocktails, eating snacks and chatting."
1433,All staff appeared to be knowledgeable and helpful.
1434,"The whole building was very accessible to wheelchair users. Disabled entrances, lifts, disabled toilets and ramps were all placed where necessary making it very easily accessable to all"
1435,"Broadwood Farm is a nice family venue with great access for everyone, but the food quality lets the restaurant down."
1436,There are only a few disabled parking spaces but free on road parking is available and there are plenty of drop kerbs for wheelchairs.
1437,Very helpful.
1438,Decent accessible loos. Could do with a couple more.
1439,We came by car. There is 3 or 4 disabled bays but the car park is large and I don't think there would be a problem finding a space
1440,helpful polite easy to talk to and get to know
1441,"Most of the hotel is available for you, we found a few steps here and there that maybe prevented us from getting to some areas, but nothing to disturb us. A lift is available anyway, so if staying overnight, then there is no problem for you. Lots of seating around if you need to rest, and coffee is always waiting for you."
1442,I can’t comment on any public toilets within the hotel but the toilet in the room itself was very spacious and had handrails and an emergency red cord.
1443,"Entrance great. Lift great, Access in and around great. Then you got to Screen 2 and the wheelchair spaces are right at the front. This means that you get a serious crick in your neck! My pal is a regular there and informs me that some of the other screens are much better and have wheelchair spaces at the back which is much better."
1444,"Solo traveller in electric wheelchair, hundreds of miles from home - I had a great holiday based at this 'Youth' hostel (SYHA). "
1445,"n the city centre, the gallery is housed in a beautiful building with good access. From a distance the entrance to the building is stepped but there were two ramps at either side that were actually not that easy to spot as they had been very cleverly blended in to be in keeping with the look of the building. Maybe a little signage would make it easier for wheelchair users as the approach."
1446,There is full wheelchair access throughout the museum with two lifts and three/four disabled toilets.
1447,Disabled friendly rooms have plenty of space in the room. The toilet and shower is fully accessible and a wet room. There is a wall seat in the shower. I use a manual wheelchair however the room is large enough to accommodate a power chair.
1448,All that was needed was there. Just lost a point for misplaced cords and loo doors in Maritime Museum badly designed in that when the door was open it blocked access to ambulance loos. 
1449,Did not use but well sign posted
1450,Very helpful
1451,Actually getting into the garden bar itself isn't bad but the terrain they use is terrible for moving about on. Some tables really close together outside but then inside it's an old sort of Victorian building. Loads of doors and bollards in the way when heading to the toilet. 
1452,"Access in and around the building:  The entrance to the hotel is directly on to the pavement of the Royal Mile. Going in through the automatic doors it’s a short step to the reception.   The hotel has a bar and lounges adjacent to reception. Downstairs, there is a lift, the restaurant provides breakfast and other dining.  The lift has a door clearance of 80 cm with a depth of 140 cm.  The corridors to the accessible rooms were lengthy with several doors. The lighting seemed rather low in these areas.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible room we visited had a slight threshold which was tricky for me as a powerchair user but possible fine for other wheelchair users.  Once in the room it was bright and light with plenty of lighting. There was room to pull alongside the bed and a space to turn in the room.  The accessible bathroom was a wet room. Getting into the bathroom required negotiating a mini ramp which for me was not the greatest experience due to the tightness of the ninety degree turn that had to be made. Other wheelchair users may find this to be manageable if their chair isn’t as large as mine at 68 cm wide and 116 cm in length. Once in the wet room there was plenty of space to manoeuvre.   Access in the dining area:  The dining area was large and spacious with tables and chair that could be moved as required. The breakfast bar was in an adjoining room and had plenty of circulation space. Getting to the dining room requires a lift journey as it is in one of the lower areas of the hotel.  Access to other facilities:  We visited the lounge area by reception. There are lots of places to sit with different styles of furniture."
1453,"Difficult place to find as sat NAV cannot always find it, it seems to be in a dead spot, so follow our easy guide to get you there, as you can read it on main review page. There are three disabled bays for parking, but anywhere will be ok.  It’s a bit of an effort to get around car park, as uphill and over rough areas, and main route for walking can also be hard work."
1454,There is one accessible toilet on the first floor located next to the lifts. there is room for a carer to assist in this area if required. Access is via 2 doors.  There was a red cord in this toilet but was tied up Red Cord card left
1455,I had a nice evening meal at the restaurant. The service was good and the food was tasty. Accessible parking bays are right outside and sat at the relaxed dining area which is close to the accessible toilet. 
1456,not many parking spaces.. we generally use train and taxi to get to the hospital
1457,"Restaurant and shop on street level are very accessible. Theres a good accessible loo, the only problem being that there were 2 nappy bins in it, which made it difficult to navigate. Staff said they would rectify this though."
1458,There's an adjacent parking area for the pub. No disabled spaces I could see.  Is alongside the pub so a bit of a trek to the front door. Don't know about buses. No parking right outside front door.
1459,An accessible loo was located next to the large bar on the south side of the square. The decking approaching this had tapered edges allowing for easy access from all side. The loo was one of the port cabin style and had a wooden ramp leading up to the door with a ninety degree turn to go through the door. Once inside it was spacious albeit  seemingly well used - the air freshener can was there for a reason! It served its purpose as a loo ...
1460,The staff were friendly and helpful
1461,Disabled parking bay
1462,"Although slight gradient to cafe from shop, not a problem and no awkward thresholds or step to negotiate ."
1463,"Ramps, automatic doors. Excellent toilet facilities."
1464,never had a look to see what they were like but if its anything like the office its self I would be more than imprest.
1465,"CAR PARKING Car parking (blue badge) is possible on Sinclair Street (opposite the North Stand).   However this fills up rapidly, so early arrival is recommended.  High density housing in the area means that street parking is very restricted (even with a blue badge)  LEAVING THE CARPARK This is a busy part of Leith and there can be unavoidable traffic congestion"
1466,Loo was great. Locked to prevent misuse but staff always nearby. Well equipped. Only issue is very tight to get to door as located in narrow passage by ladies loo. Access host ensured queue for ladies let me pass.
1467,Drove from Wiltshire straight to the main entrance of the museum and was immediately shown to the disabled parking area right in front of the museum.  Nothing could have been easier!
1468,"Unfortunately it isn't really accessible at all.  Maybe if you were on crutches, had a stick or a guide dog, but not for wheelchair users."
1469,Good roomy disabled loos at the entrance and pub. The only negative was a really nasty smell in the one by the entrance (which we reported.
1470,"I travelled by car and could park right outside, and just a few meters away there is a corner with dropped curbs for getting on the pavement, and you can park on the little street. There is a car park across from road. It is near the centre of town so easily accessible by bus and train. "
1471,"The library is on Victoria Avenue, next to the rose garden and just off Station Parade.   Pay and display parking is available (up to two hours) on Victoria Avenue. Disabled parking spaces are available on Victoria Avenue near the library entrance.  The bus station and railway station are both situated only a few minutes walk away."
1472,"Excellent choice of access, there is a lift at the front of the hotel operated by the staff, or access through the car park into the hotel. Help was readily available."
1473,"The entrance to the shop is a pair of very stiff and heavy doors. It was a real struggle to open one of them at the same time as operating my powerchair joystick and negotiating my way in. Not helpful - automatic electric doors are needed here.  The shop is terribly cramped. The aisles would be just about wide enough if they weren't cluttered up with products for sale, extra display units, rolling stools (which are ancient and have lost their wheels) and numerous other objects which shouldn't be cluttering the shop up. In addition there were many dozens of packing cases cluttering up many areas of the shop, so that it was completely impossible, in a wheelchair at least, to get at greetings cards, reference books, and some other areas.  If you like a big challenge and an obstacle course, you will love this shop - I didn't love it, I found it all frustrating and annoying and I won't be going back there again.  "
1474,"big car park, level access from car park except for very small well-placed ramp at front door"
1475,The cafe is wheelchair accessible with door opening pads and automatic doors. Good circulation space. Dedicated disabled parking nearby. BUT. Well designed toilet limited by short red cord and a wooden baby changing unit that prevents side transfer to toilet. 
1476,"There is an expanse of space in the museum, with wide passageways and smooth flooring throughout - making it ideal if moving around in a wheelchair. There are staff at desks near the entrances as well as around the museum, who are happy to help answer any questions. You can also pick up a free map of the museum when you arrive. There is a hearing loop.  As there is a lot of information written beside each of the exhibits, it would perhaps be a useful feature if they had a recording/headset of this you could use as you went round - I am not aware of this being available. This is what I would describe as a 'traditional' museum - with lots of very interesting things to see. However, the majority cannot be touched. For some people, particularly with sensory impairments, or who have a more energetic nature, they may prefer a more interactive style. I liked that at various points around the place there are stacks of folding chairs. Visitors are welcome to use these whenever they want, whether they want a rest, or to sit and enjoy watching/listening to something."
1477,parking and buses
1478,I arrived using public transport and it was fairly easy to get to the hotel. The buses stop at the top of the street and also in nearby Lothian Road. There are connections to most parts of the city and the buses were wheelchair accessible for my travelling companion.
1479,"Isle Of Wight Pearl is a large shop that sells a range of jewellery based on pearls. From rings to bracelets. It also has pick a pearl where you can pick an oyster with no idea what size or colour pearl will be in it. You can then get this set on a ring, bracelet or charm. Or just have the pearl. Also has a cafe. It is right on the cliff edge with amazing views across to Yarmouth bay. It is a great place to stop off for a drink or just to browse the jewellery. No entrance fee and staff do not pressure you even slightly to buy."
1480,"This is the place to go when in Newcastle. The whole place is pretty much accessible, the only annoying thing that the front entrance, with the shop, has a series of steps   up to the access to the lift that take you to the galleries. The Accessible route is a long path way round the ride with a long path which can not be shortcuted. "
1481,There are plenty of staff walking around available to assist you if you have any problems. They are approachable and friendly.
1482,"Fitz Park provides a lovely flat tarmac, traffic free route to enjoy the mountain views.   It's a multi-functional park with a cricket pitch, football pitch, fantastic children's play area, stunning views, path alongside the river, benches and is popular with dog walkers.  It can get busy, and if you want to get out of the crowds you can access the quieter and more tranquil Upper Fitz Park either by crossing the road or by going under the bridge next to the river.  Upper Fitz Park includes beautiful trees, benches, flat tarmac path, tennis courts and bowling greens.  Cafe West is located in the main Fitz Park and provide a range of mainly tray bake cakes, hot and cold food and drinks and ice-creams.  Cafe West has one accessible toilet, and separate male and female toilets which can be used by anyone, but they do ask for a donation for use of the toilets if you are not a customer of the cafe.  The cafe is run by supported staff who have learning disabilities.  All staff are very friendly and the cafe is very disability aware.  Cafe West is dog friendly.  Parking is available at the far end of Fitz Park, just off Crosthwaite Road, in one of two car parks.  Alternatively there is  limited on-street parking on Station Road, next to Cafe West and the museum.  "
1483,Access to the bungalow is up a well built ramp and through the front door. There is a slight lip at the threshold .The bungalow. And amazing garden are all on one level. Lots of benches round the garden for a rest.
1484,Didn't need any assistance but sure staff would have been fab if I had.
1485,Excellent - it's purpose built
1486,There is a small lip into the cafe which has been dealt with by attaching a small ramp that ties in with the decking elsewhere. There is a dropped counter inside at the till as well. Outside there are various low picnic benches and then lots of spaces to picnic throughout the Helix park where this cafe can be found.
1487,Disabled and baby changing toilet. There are grab rails with a sink and mirror at wheelchair height.
1488,Ramp up to entrance. Once inside a lift to first floor where most paintings are. 
1489,"The staff were very friendly and very polite. The first member of staff delivered both the drinks and the food to the table, saving either me or my friend having to struggle to and from the counter between the tables. Unfortunately the standard is you pick up your drinks themselves so on second order of drinks, my friend who has trouble walking had to do it that time. But I'm sure if we'd have asked on order, they would have brought it over for us. I've never been here and not had helpful, friendly service. "
1490,Large Supermarket in Dumbarton. Has just been refurbished and had a change of lay-out.  Generally access is good but a couple of changes could make it even better. 
1491,"There was a shared accessible loo which was fairly clean for last thing before closing with enough space and grab bars by the toilet and the sink, however, the emergency cord was tied around a grab-bar and this could be an issue."
1492,"This resort was designed for disabled people and all of the facilities and rooms are accessible.   There is a swimming pool with a ramp so people can be wheeled into the water. A beach chair is available to use.  Throughout the resort there is level access with lots of ramps and wide pathways making it easy for wheelchair users to get around.  A couple of accessible minibuses took me out on trips every day to interesting places. All the staff were lovely and friendly, and very helpful.  My room was spacious with a bed raised off the ground so that my mobile hoist could get underneath. I had a good sized bathroom with a roll in shower, although there was a little bit of a lip around the shower that my shower chair had to go over.  "
1493,There is level access 
1494,Great advice and information from the visitor centre staff on the best accessible routes around the park/area.
1495,"I drove to the gardens and I do not know about public transport. There are 6 generously sized blue badge parking spaces, 4 very close to the entrance and 2 a further 10 metres away. See photo."
1496,plenty of disabled parking near lifts
1497,They were very patient in communicating when we just had English. 
1498,The staff we met were all very friendly and helpful. Our questions were answered and there was a definite feeling of wanting to provide a “guest experience” not simply somewhere to stay.
1499,"Getting into the hotel was all level access, but there were several slight rises were carpets met, could be a trip hazard. It’s an old building so corridors were a little narrow.  My room door was a standard size and not widened for a wheelchair, also an old fashioned key access which was a little high. Once inside the room was pretty spacious, as we had twin beds there wasn’t a lot of room for a wheelchair between them due to the sofa bed.  I’m sure the staff would have moved it if asked.  An important point was lack of plug sockets. Only two in the room which were located on the wall opposite the beds, no USB ports.  Luckily I always have an extension cable in my bag (I use an oxygen concentrator and CPAP machine overnight) and a power pack for my phone - I need it beside me in case of an emergency.  The room did have a flashing fire alarm, but I was never asked if I needed assistance in an emergency and there wasn’t a escape plan on my door.  My room was next to the fire exit however.  One point I didn’t check before arrival was access to the function suite (we were there for a wedding). Getting into the restaurant was up two large steps, no ramps at all.  There was access through the hotel (not pointed out to me until the end of the night). Once inside the suite was upstairs and there is no lift. These steps were steep and round two bends.  I can’t do stairs at all.  Luckily it was a family wedding and I have several well built cousins that could carry me up.  Not very dignified or comfortable, and as each time the room had to be changed i.e. from service to meal, then to dinner then to dance, we had to go back down to the restaurant each time."
1500,Accessible loo on each floor. Changing places space with shower and hoist and changing table. Detailed descriptions on website.
1501,Staff went out of their way to make things easy for us.
1502,"Fusciardi's is an Italian family run business which opened in 1967. Offering 18 different flavours of ice cream from traditional vanilla to Oriental Ginger, Raspberry Bubble Gum and After Eight Mint. There is a take away counter as well as traditional ice cream parlour with indoor and outdoor seating."
1503,There is an accessible loo that was easy find. It was clean & tidy with plenty of room to manoeuvre & enough space for a carer (should one be required). It also has more than enough grabrails.
1504,"Great & interesting museum in the heart of London. Accessible to all - you can tell that much thought has been put into exhibitions, displays and how information is presented. Staff very helpful & enthusiastic."
1505,"Disabled access and right next to Tooting Bec station, excellent spot for great tasting healthy food, and so easy to get to. Hop on the northern line "
1506,The toilet at the cottage was fully accessible
1507,There is step free alfresco seating with movable table and chairs. I'm sorry I can't remember if there were steps into the restaurant but I dont think there was.
1508,Staff were very helpful and welcoming.
1509,"Went to the outlet as part of a day trip out with a client who requires a wheelchair for walking long distances. Plenty of parking, wheelchair accessible, friendly staff in stores and outlet staff themselves helpful."
1510,"For our group of people living with dementia a great place for some lunch in their lovely tearoom and an afternoon of looking at their beautiful birds. The owners were so helpful and friendly and the tearoom was very cosy with its warming fireplace and delicious food. The only downside was that it was slightly cold on the field were the flying demonstration was but we just heading back to the tearoom to warm up again. All and all a great place to go for some lunch and an afternoon, not really enough to do for the whole day though!"
1511,"The Design Museum is located on Kensington High Street and is next to Holland Park.    The nearest tube is High Street Kensington, which is not step free, as it involves a flight of stairs with handrails to exit/ enter all its platforms. If you do use High Street Kensington tube exit the station, walk through the small shopping centre immediately in front of you and on exiting onto the street turn left. It's about a 5 - 8 minute walk and the museum is on the opposite side of street to the tube station. It is a level road with drop kerbs, but remember this is a busy shopping street.  There are a number of buses that stop very close by."
1512,"The disabled toilet is on the ground floor, and is spacious and clean. There is no pull-cord or red button to summon assistance. The area includes a pull down baby-change table."
1513,City centre pedestrian location. 
1514,"The King's Fund is a charity that works towards improving health care. Their offices contain a library which is open to the public. I visited to attend Bertie's Book Club, a group that meets monthly to discuss books with a medical theme. The evening I attended they were discussing The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon. "
1515,"Escape game where everyone can play a part to work through the clues. Needs at least one able bodied person to move around objects and undo various padlocks.  Address: Arch 94, Chadwick Court, Chadwick Street. Liverpool L3 7EY"
1516,Fairly basic accessible toilet
1517,"We had a day to spend while on Glasgow & it was absolutely pouring outside. We parked in the multi-storey car park which has usual disabled parking spaces, with large accessible lifts to the shopping centre. There was easy access to all the shops, we also went to the cinema here which is also accessible with friendly,helpful staff. Afterwards we met family for a meal at Nando's, also very accessible. All in all  we had a good day without being outside at all. Toilets are numerous & of a very high standard. "
1518,"One accessible toilet - a modern build,  which is the proud owner of a Red Cord Card."
1519,there is a disabled toilet next to the ticket office you have to ask staff for the key.
1520,There was a disabled toilet on each floor but the downstairs one was hard to get in and to do so you had to block the entrance to the men's toilet which also made it hard to reverse out. The two I used had red cords that weren't quite straight down but did reach the floor. There were plenty of rails.
1521,"We access the services via a lift from street level.  Issues were that the button was quite hard to reach from the mobility scooter or wheelchair even without restricted mobility, and the button had to be continually pressed while calling the lift and while using the lift.  It was big enough that the mobility scooter fit no problem.  When inside, the venue is spacious but there are only a couple of tables that would be suitable for someone using a wheelchair as the others are accessed via some stairs.  Other tables are at a height that is out of reach for someone in a wheelchair.  Orders are taken at the bar, but i'm sure that if someone was having difficulties that the staff would offer a table service.  Navigation around the main services were fine."
1522,I use buses to get around Perth which is handy for me as the pub is in the corner of where the buses drop off and pick up. There is also a car park in the same street across the road. Generally I get someone able-bodied or standing atleast to order the food but there is a shorter area at the end of the bar that you should be able to use to order where they can then see you. It can definitely get busy trying to order during football times.
1523,The staff were very helpful
1524,"When we arrived there wasn't anyone to scan my ticket, from then I didn't really interact with any more staff members. From looking around though the staff members seemed very friendly."
1525,"Access to get in from the drop kerb was blocked by garden furniture. It was lightweight furniture so it was easy for my brother to move out the way but was disappointing.  In the part of the restaurant containing the bar, there’s 2 flat levels that are connected by a ramp (not too steep) and wooden floors. The tables are nicely spaced so there’s room to get around.  Tight access to disabled loo because of the coat rack, needs some good steering in a manual wheelchair. For reference, my wheelchair width is 48cm/18.9” excluding the wheels. You would have to ask staff to move coat racks for a power chair.   I was very disappointed leaving the restaurant, they had put an extra table covering most of the back entrance/exit doors (the wheelchair accessible one next to the disabled parking). I had to ask another customer to move and I scraped along the door. I managed to squeeze through just about but only because the left side of my wheelchair could fit under the table, and my wheelchair was narrow enough to fit through the section of single door that wasn’t blocked. It was uncomfortable for everyone and clearly they just hadn’t put thought into that being the wheelchair exit. "
1526,"True glaswegians, very friendly and helpful."
1527,No problem with access. Lift and ramp provided to easily get in the canal boat.
1528,Capability Scotland has wide automatic doors with easy access. The door buzzer and signs are very high for wheelchair users.
1529,All furniture in kitchen and bedroom was height adjustable.  No steps and easy for a wheelchair user to move around.  Seating for the able bodied.
1530,"For a country park the access is good with plenty of parking spaces, accessible toilets, an information centre, and a map to show you where to explore ( on the website at http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/holyrood-park-map-and-guide.pdf )."
1531,The pub doesn't have its own parking but there is plenty of on street parking
1532,"Clearly marked accessible bays, approximately 5 of them (?) "
1533,Café area near entrance. Everything was on the level. good size walkways within building. Single entrance door wasn't heavy to push/pull open
1534,I had a fantastic night at the Macklemore concert at O2 Academy in Glasgow.  This was the first time I'd been here and I had heard mixed reviews about its wheelchair accessibility but it was great from the minute I made myself known to security to the minute they helped me to leave; I couldn't have felt more welcome.  The highlight was feeling safe while still in the middle of the action and not being split up from my friends and family!  The staff were lovely and the concert was UNBELIEVABLE!!!! and even better than in the SECC a couple of years before.
1535,Warm and welcoming.
1536,The deputy manager (Jack) made bad situation bearable.
1537,"Tottenham Court Road Station is near by and fully step-free but check before you travel because its lifts, which are new, are notoriously unreliable and often break down. Oxford Street has zillions of bus routes running along it. I wouldn't dream of parking in the West End, or if I did, it wouldn't be a dream, it would be a nightmare."
1538,Parking availabile to book right outside the stadium 
1539,"Beside the A32 and the Meon River this pub has plenty of parking (2 wheelchair bays beside front door), flat access, plenty of room and tables suitable for wheelchair users. The beers and food are locally sourced and of highest quality - indeed chips (triple-fried) were voted 'best ever'. Interesting seasonal menu that changes regularly and some mouth-watering dishes (slow roast venison shank and slow-roast ox cheek, to mention just two recent ones).  Have wheelchair accessible loo but I didn't use it."
1540,Staff were very helpful.
1541,"For a country park i would rate this as 5 star, there is a mixture of tarmac, wooden walk ways, hard gravel paths, it is also relatively flat. We visited with a wheelchair and my wife pushed me round the lake with realtive easy would also be idea for mobility scooter and powered wheelchair.  "
1542,NKS/radar which was good. Adequate grab rails and enough rom for a large chair. 
1543,Disabled parking is right outside the side door of the hotel in designated slots. Taxis can pull up outside the front door. The metro train from Glasgow Central is a short walk which may be too far for a wheelchair user with luggage. 
1544,On street parking. Parking may be available by arrangement in the garage if you have access requirements. Buses pass along nearby Bernard Street and along the Shore.
1545,Its not good
1546,Technically wheelchair accessible
1547,"The staff were as if sedated: uninterested in customers, and certainly not interested when I raised the question of a missing lift."
1548,I must say that the staff of Thistle and Get2Gether were fantastic. 
1549,Those we asked permission of to see various places of interest were very helpful and kind.
1550,There was no accessible toilet.
1551,"Clean, although not particularly spacious. "
1552,Parking was excellent with plenty of bays situated to the front of the hotel amidst the woodland glade. Two accessible bays are marked out near the front door and there's plenty of other space. Buses run on the nearby main road so it is easy to catch a bus into town if required.
1553,"Staff were very helpful. They explained the security procedures as I passed through and were considerate of my needs as a powerchair user. During my visit I met several staff, all of whom were helpful and added to the visit."
1554,Car park is massive but busy
1555,They didn't want to be there but I am sure would help if requested
1556,There was a receptionist at the front door who was very helpful but I didn't see any other members of staff around.
1557,Lots of staff but always had to try and get their attention. Our young waiter tried his best but spilt some of my mussells onto his shirt and the tray. Staff could have been a bit more on it..
1558,Longish hike/scoot from Seaton (half a mile) or there is a good car park (look out for symbol of bird as it is tucked behind the cemetery!). If you can access Seaton tram (not suitable for wheelchairs) you can take a trip to Colyford and visit reserve before making the return journey.
1559,Everything in it. Its a bit tight but I manage to turn round in it. As mentioned already it is at the end of a downward facing (albeit short) corridor.
1560,"There are a few nearby disabled parking bays, but for the most park the car parks dotted around Leeds city centre should be used. Travelling Man is very close to the bus station and several bus stops, and is reasonably close to the train station. Pedestrian access is of a high standard as Travelling Man is near the main shopping district in Leeds City Centre."
1561,The accessible toilet is spacious and fully equipped. It was extremely clean!
1562,Monte St Michel is totally inaccessible to disabled visitors
1563,"Me, my husband, his mobility scooter, our son, his lady and their dog.   After a visit to the museum we  decided to wander around the harbour area.  Well worth the effort of finding a parking space.  Lots to see.  Some steep gradients and a variety of surfaces from cobbles to concrete to travel to tarmac but the scooter managed admirably.  Actually quite a number of scooters tootling around all seeming to be getting where they wanted to."
1564,there is an accessible toilet opposite the counter. there is a sliding door & plenty of space. on our visit they were very clean & pleasant.
1565,The cottage is all level access with a level footpath all the way around the property. The parking area is level too with the cottage and is tarmac. 
1566,Helpful and efficient.
1567,There on Saturday and thoroughly enjoyed it. Access excellent for my wheelchair. Great lift to first floor and they also have a superb disabled access toilet. All staff very kind and helpful and plenty of room for wheelchair in their little café.  I highly recommend the museum to anyone with mobility problems as they can also loan you a wheelchair if necessary. Plenty of parking with designated blue badge holders spaces. All the information contained in the museum is a real eye-opener and the story of the girls was wonderfully told by a very knowledgable gentleman with a good clear voice. Hubby and I will definitely return when we next stay in Gretna.
1568,"Room 204 has a wet room and, like almost all accessible rooms at Premier Inn it is a good size with plenty of room for a wheelchair user to move about freely. Width of main door: 86cm. The room is located on the ground floor of a separate block from where the reception is and the automatic door to that block is operated by placing you room key card on the sensor.  The king size bed was made up of two single zip and lock beds and, at a height of 49cm it was okay for my wife to transfer from her wheelchair. The mattress was comfortable enough, and two firm pillows and two softer pillows were available to us.   The window looked out to a hedgerow, which helped to block out the traffic noise from the M5, just over 200 metres beyond it. The outer double glazed window could be opened to a degree, which afforded us with fresh air but, when closed along with the secondary sliding window meant there was no noise from outside to be heard The blackout curtains were effective, plunging the room into darkness. The A/C comes from a standalone wall-mounted unit, effectively cooling the room to 19ºC. The fan was quiet with the only noise to be heard from it being the draining of the excess water.  There were enough electrical sockets around the room but none at the sides of the bed; this wasn’t a particular problem for us but could be troublesome for a guest that needs to plug in a CPAP device or other essential device during the night.  I’m sure though that the hotel would be able to provide an extension cable. The basic Wi-Fi was weak, with a few dropouts. Our mobile data (O²) was weak.  As is common with most of the hotels in this chain, the accessible bathroom was a good size, with a sliding door that opened to a width of 82cm.  The thermostatic shower was easy to control and the water pressure was very good; it remained at a constant temperature whilst showering. We often find that the shower area in PI wet rooms doesn’t have a shelf on which to place shampoo, body wash and so on.  It can be very difficult for a disabled person, when seated, to reach necessary items when the floor is the only place to put them. This shower did have a soap dish, so half marks for that, but a bigger shelf is needed. The bathroom though was showing signs of wear and tear; the shower seat was well past its sell-by date and my wife found it to be very uncomfortable.  I would describe the room as being in the old style with a couple of additions, such as the large screen TV with the HDMI input socket below. It was pleasing that the room still had the old style wardrobe unit, which we prefer to the ones in the updated rooms; it offers more storage capacity.  The room also lacked the vanity mirror of the newer rooms, which is always set too high for a wheelchair user.  One major problem in this room is the height of the coat hooks which, at 168cm from the floor are totally useless for a wheelchair user; see photograph.  This problem could be easily rectified; they are fixed to a wooden panel, which could be lowered to the appropriate height. Take note management!   The hotel only has a breakfast room, which we did not use.  There is though a Toby Inn, which is not affiliated to the hotel, next door and within walking distance; we didn’t use that either.  "
1569,Flat level entrance. Did not find anywhere I couldn’t get in my wheelchair. Sensible sized lift.
1570,"Natural History Museum is a large museum with a has a wide range of fascinating specimens. With impressive galleries including dinosaurs, animals, birds, fish and fossils. If the score was just for the collection I would give it 5 out of 5, it's stunning and world class. While the building itself has good general accessibility, my overall experience and expectations of going this major South Kensignton Museum was disappointing."
1571,"We attended this fantastic event as part of a belated birthday celebration; it was part of the 'Under Canvas' summer festival of events at Eden Court Theatre and Cinema and the event that we attended was a 'global music D.J.' set, held in a marquee adjacent to the theatre.  This was the first live music event I've attended since Lockdown began and I can't stress how well worth the wait it was.  I was feeling nervous about mixing with people at an event like this but the Covid safe system that the staff employed, along with being in a tent and having an open air dance area, made me feel as reassured as I could have been at a public event.   Capacity was limited and distancing was maintained around tables but this didn't affect the atmosphere at all and actually made it better for our party.  It was just the perfect balance with music with universal appeal which crossed all age barriers.  We had delicious pizza and drinks and the table service was really good too. "
1572,Access into the venue hall itself was okay but on the Main Street it was terrible- pavements need to be lowered for wheelchairs as every pavement gap was a struggle.
1573,"Toilets are accessible ,spacious and clean."
1574,It is level access in and throughout the centre. Lifts access all floors and these are big enough for a wheelchair user and a few more people. Some lifts have bright flashing lights and music playing inside which could be quite uncomfortable. Signage could be a bit clearer. Of course each shop is different but the centre in general has wide aisles and space to move around. There is also a lot of seating available throughout.
1575,Parking available but we did not use it 
1576,One small area of dropped curb only Which could be blocked by Parkes cars
1577,"Superbly equipped holiday lodges for disabled people and their family or friends in an amazing location.  Ideally situated to get out and about in the East Neuk of Fife and beyond.  For relaxing ""at home"" days, each lodge has beautiful gardens and private outdoor space with views of the sea and links golf course.  Brilliant, helpful and friendly Reception and cafe staff makes Homelands the No. 1 holiday destination for disabled people in Scotland."
1578,Disabled parking is directly near the front door.
1579,Good disabled parking facilities
1580,*See Access Rating Overall Description. Due to the nature of the museum there are some cobbled/uneven surfaces but largely surfaces are good.
1581,"I attended a come & try curling event at the National Curling Academy at The PEAK. Overall the experience was very enjoyable - it was wonderfully accessible on all levels, the numerous accessible toilets were very spacious (let down only by the absence of an official changing places toilet), and the facilities for disabled sports fans were very intuitive and useful. A great experience! "
1582,"There are disabled toilets located at the top of the quarry park area, near the main gates."
1583,"Lovely staff and food, just a shame building is a bit inaccessible"
1584,Clueless on the red cord situation and acted like it wasn’t a big deal even after I explained but another one I met was nice and helpful when I needed to reach a change machine.
1585,"Wheelchair accessible, reasonably priced food, staff extremely helpful, nothing was too much trouble"
1586,Debbie and Helen helped me find the stores I was looking for
1587,"I don't drive, so I don't know what the parking is like - but from a quick search, the nearest blue badge spaces are on  Hood Street. There is also good access via the metro; the monument is the nearest stop, less than one minute walk away.   As I have a disabled bus pass, I went with my partner by bus. There is a direct bus that stops very near the cinema. "
1588,"The doors are a little heavy still, but a decent sized toilet."
1589,Can enter the store in a wheelchair. 
1590,"A very warm and friendly atmosphere.  Nice food, staff very helpful and friendly.  Parking is in the  market Square and there are some disabled parking bays but if you wish to be near the bistro it is likely to be street parking and maybe not go on a Friday when it's market day.  Disabled Access, there is a slight lip on the door when coming in and room to get in with a wheel chair,  they will move the tables if needed and not to busy to accommodate wheelchair users.  Not sure about the disabled toilet facilities, when asked when doing this review on paper they said they did have a disabled toilet around the back of the building, so not sure how you'd get to that. There are toilets for more abled bodied people upstairs.  The stairs do sound a bit creaky but are safe!! Trust me you can't be any worse when I've been up going up there with my dodgy knee! The staff are great with dealing with people with hidden disabilities and there is a Autism and learning difficulty place where people can go nearby.  So they are frequently in there the ladies and gents from there."
1591,"Access in couldn't be easier with a large open entrance and level access. You wheel straight in to the bank with easy access to the cash machines around to the left, the main desk area directly in front and people on hand to meet and greet to answer any questions or offer help."
1592,Accessible clean and spacious toilets
1593,"Varied toilets facilities to accommodate most, if not all levels of disability."
1594,I drove and there were 4 disabled parking spaces close to the start of the path. There was gravel to cross hencce why only 4 stars.
1595,"Very Close to the venue, brilliant"
1596,See photographs
1597,Great. Very helpful and friendly. Recommend them very highly.
1598,"A new public entrance has been created to coincide with the opening of the museum which provides a steps free entrance. The museum and chapel are all located on the ground floor and there are no steps. The museum is small and the passage way  through the museum can get busy.  From the museum there is entrance into the chapel. The Thackeray café, next door has a couple of steps at the entrance but there is a buzzer for people with disabilities that need help and I noted that there is a fold up ramp by the door. The café is a self service restaurant."
1599,"The main entrance to Temple of Boom has a step in the door, so wheelchair access is via the entrance used for vehicles. This entrance is a large archway, with double gates shutting it off from the public. The door through this gate has a step in it, but remains open so that someone can step through and open for me (if a member of staff hasn’t got to it first, which is unusual). The pavement outside Temple of Boom is poorly maintained, with potholes and uneven kerbs, but this pavement is not owned by Temple of Boom.  Once through the gate, there is a short slope into the main courtyard.  On the right is the bar and toilets. There is a concrete ramp into this building, and double doors plenty wide enough to allow a wheelchair through. An accessible toilet is available, complete with grab rails and emergency cords, but full changing facilities are unfortunately not included. The key to this toilet can be obtained from members of staff, who are all very friendly and accommodating.  On the left is the room where events (concerts, wrestling shows etc.) takes place. There are two entrances; one has a small lip down into a narrow corridor which is surpass-able in a wheelchair, but if preferred the goods entrance is more accessible, with level access and a wider doorway. Food can be purchased from a bar in this room.  There are several nearby carparks with disabled parking spaces, and quite a few bus stops available in the area for travel. "
1600,"The staff were lovely and always on hand when we needed anything.  When it started to rain, they moved the sun umbrella over me without me having to ask; they were very obliging, courteous and pleasant.  I had my wee wild 2 year-old niece with us; she didn't always understand social distancing and sometimes chased balloons about!  The security staff member was really good with her and even retrieved her balloons for her.  "
1601,Always willing to help and assist. My only concern is that it can be quite difficult to find a member of staff at times!
1602,I let the train take the strain. 
1603,"Parking is at the local hotel, no designated bays."
1604,"I'll start by saying that Spark is a literal stack of shipping containers that they've somehow managed to make fully accessible. Gentrification at it's finest. The end facing the city centre (north, I think) is the accessible end. There is a slight bump to get onto the patio, which smoothly inclines into the area itself. It has one of those curtains made of plastic strips, but one end is left clear (which I only noticed after struggling through the strands of plastic). Once inside, all of the various stall are accessible from a wheelchair. Some of the counters are slightly high in places. Unbelievably, there is lift access to the top floor. Sadly the ramp to get on the bottom of the lift is  way too steep for comfort & not for the faint of heart, but once you're up it's fine. It being a platform lift it did rather comically get stuck at the top. Staff were extremely responsive & got me back down within minutes, & were lovely about it all the while I quietly died with embarrassment.  The staff attitude more than made up for the accessibility concerns."
1605,"At all points of this trip, parking was easy enough, free in the woods, and as we did not stop to visit the Arboretum, that to was free for us, normally the price of parking would be included with your entrance fee, as it will be if you visit the Safari park."
1606,Disabled parking on flat smooth area close to the entrance. No public transport. 
1607,Nearby free parking with disabled bays
1608,Those we met were very nice and willing
1609,"The accessible toilet is good in many ways, but it's an odd shape, and there are two monstrous bins blocking much of the turning space, so it's extremely difficult to manoeuvre and transfer to the toilet - amazingly thoughtless. See my picture. In addition, the toilet is not lockable from the inside: the RADAR locking mechanism is *broken*. When the inner door handle is in the raised, i.e. ""locked"" position, nobody should be able to get in from outside. I was very angry when someone burst in on me when I had my trousers down. They really need to fix this broken lock - disgraceful!"
1610,The staff here were exceptional and very welcoming. Steve came with us to the ice to attach a wheelchair board and was generally very helpful.
1611,There are 2 cafes within the museum so it is easy to get confused as they are not very well signed. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. One is a restaurant and the other is a small cafe so serves different meals.  The quayside entrance to the museum is often used as a skate park for skateboarding so be careful as you walk and don’t be afraid to ask them to stop while you pass.
1612,Is parking just beside.  Very limited public transport though.
1613,"Everything went very smoothly, no problems re accessibility."
1614,Level access from the street and a lift to the required floors.  Hearing assistance.
1615,"I didn't spot any loos down at the beach itself, but there was a lovely clean spacious accessible loo up at the Shandon Hotel."
1616,"Several accessible toilets - and clearly sign posted. Not far to go to find one from any location in the building as they are on all floors. Spacious, clean and bright."
1617,"This is a new and innovative development. I and my friend are both wheelchair users with assistance dogs. We didn't need them but hoists are available. It had the feel of a 5 star hotel and none of the clinical feel some wet rooms have. A spa bath with hoist s also available. Each room has its own French Windows to a ground level deck that runs round the entire property. Moveable walls mean you can create the perfect space for any group. Studio apartments available with connecting doors for carers if required. The atmosphere is happy and Moira welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble for her. She welcomes suggestions and comments as she is still in her early days. Get in quick before she is fully booked all year round. Feels in the middle of nowhere but only 20minutes from Cupar. Our breakfast sitting in the Sun looking at stunning countryside was unforgettable. Well equipped kitchens (2 adapted). Just go, I will be back!"
1618,Everyone said it would be tricky as a wheelchair user! Great to be able to report that it was fantastic !! After thinking I would struggle to get around as a wheelchair user it was great to find although hilly it was possible and the mobility vehicle a great plus.
1619,Staff helpful
1620,good facilities
1621,No parking at the venue but there are on road disabled bays on nearby Beaumont Street and New Inn Hall Street and you can park in resident's only bays in Oxford if you have a blue badge.
1622,"Subway stations in central Manhattan are extremely busy making it difficult to manoeuvre a wheelchair (or similar) , if you're even able to get into the station!!! From what I remember there were very few lifts, often out of service and difficult to use. I witnessed wheelchair users being physically unable to fit into the subway carriage due to the vast amount of passengers, meaning they would wait until a long time for a carriage with enough room, especially during rush hours. Overall, I will say that it is possible to use the subways in central Manhattan, although difficult, time consuming and infuriating. "
1623,We have been here before and always enjoy our stay. We have 2 dogs one of which is my assistance dog. The lodge is very comfortable and spacious. The lodge sleeps 8 to 10 people and is dog friendly. There are also profiling beds in the lodge which helps me to sleep better. Lots to do in the local area. The seated exercise class on a Wednesday morning is great fun in the Paxton Centre.
1624,"Effecient staff, helpful with menu and didn't hurry our group as we got caught up in conversation."
1625,The staff are always incredibly welcoming and offer assistance wherever needed. Can't speak highly enough of the CitizenM staff.
1626,"Excellent parking at the lodge door (Cardy lodge ‘s parking is just opposite the front door a few metres away). Other accessible parking spaces in the car park.  Nearest bus stops are about 200-250 metres away, close to the shops. Buses pass through the village to St Andrews (link bus to Dundeé), Leven,. Edinburgh and Glasgow can be reached with 1 change. NB It may be necessary to have your w/chair checked by Stagecoach for size/ manoeuvrability.   Markinch rail station is only 15 minutes away. "
1627,Staying at the Premier in Stratford was surprisingly straightforward. It's unusual in that reception is on the first floor and it's attached to a shopping centre. It's very modern and the accessible room I had was great with a picture window looking across to the Olympic Park.
1628,"We did not notice any disabled parking spots on this visit, but will look next time and update here.   The number 45 bus from Newcastle Haymarket bus station comes closest."
1629,Changing places toilet.  Toilet seat loose on visit - reported to staff - should be fixed.
1630,"There is some free standing tables and chairs on the pavement outside the cafe. Entrance is by a very small step, see photo. Inside there are free standing tables and chairs, spaciously laid out. "
1631,I didn't use the toilet but there is one available and is on the level floor.
1632,Several loos located around the campus. All well signposted.
1633,Centrally located with huge coffee cups. Henry's Coffee House is a great place to relax in City Square. The coffee house has a step-free entrance and sheltered seating outside. 
1634,Multi-storey car park so protected from the weather.
1635,"This is a delightful half days visit through beautiful scenic woodland and open pastures, and a trip that a disabled person can manage and enjoy.  We Start the trip in the small town of Kinver which lies in South Staffordshire, in the district of Stourbridge.  The earliest record is found in a charter of 736ad, and it’s present church dates from the 12th century. It’s High Street was laid out in the late 13th century, while it’s main  Pub, the White Hart dates back to the 14th century.  KINVER was known for its sturdy woolen cloth, and it was also a stop on the road from Chester to Bristol, where the White Hart benefitted by the passing trade route. The river was used to power Slitting mills during the mid 1600,s, and with these mills they Slit bars of Iron into rods to be made into nails. Sadly these mills closed by about 1892. There is a local story, but completely unfounded, that the family of Dick Whittington lived here in the area.  We then moved across to Kinver Edge, with its broadleaved woodland, famous now for its landmark of the rock caves, carved into the sandstone, and lived in until the 1960,s, some of them restored to show us how they lived in the 1930,s, where at one time 11 families lived here. The caves date back to the 18th century, believed   to be used as a home from 1770.  An able bodied person can walk up the hill to the caves to see its gardens, orchard, and allotments, now being restored, and there is a tea room and toilets, with an outdoor seating area.   Sadly, for those of us disabled, there is no way we can get up to see them, but the paths around the hill allows us a chance to see the rock face, as our photo shows.  Now though, we can enjoy Kinver woods, sometimes called the Royal Forest, with almost 19 acres of wood containing many broadleaved trees, such as Birch, Oak, and Sweet chestnut. To the South you will find coniferous woodland.  In 1917 almost 19 acres of these woods were given to the National Trust, and it now has a circular path, but not really ideal for disabled people at the moment. All in all, some 200 acres of land, with 40 or so miles of footpaths and bridleways cover the area and surrounding countryside, and here you may see Adders, Common Lizards, Badgers and the Red fox.  It truly is a beautiful woodland, and we wish to now offer you our review, to see if we can encourage you to go and see for yourself this delightful area. We hope you will enjoy your trip, but if you feel you will not be able to travel that far, why not read our review, and if you like it, please tick the “I like “ button, which may encourage others to read the review and consider taking the trip.   KINVER is a small town in the area of Stourbridge, (photo 1). It has just one small street, but a nice place to start, and it may draw you to want to see some of the small shops, and a few coffee shops. The Clock Tower attractively stands by Kinver drive (photo 2) which leads up to Kinver church.  Just on the edge of the street is a small tea room, which looks inviting , a Miss Marple tea room. (photo 3).  A short drive away , we parked in the one disabled bay, to admire the woodlands  (photo 4)  it is possible to get a view of the famous Kinver Edge rock, (photo 5) and it’s old inhabited sandstone caves. Unfortunately it is impossible for a disabled person to get up to the caves. KINVER woods is an ancient woodland of an unknown date, (many speculate of course) with many a pathway of hard compressed soil, so on a dry day an ideal friendly route for us. The middle path (photo 6)  allows a short walk to another car park that your carer could perhaps easily manage for you.  The Autumn colours were just beginning to show their beauty at this next car park (photo 7) on an early November day. Depending on how you both feel, it is possible  to attempt another mile or so to the next car park, (photo 8) or return to pick your car up at the first car park, then make the journey by car on a scenic narrow lane to  the car park (photo 9). The next car park is along this lane with easy access into the woods (photo 10). From here you can return to the first car park if you attempted the ride, a scooter or powerchair will manage this quite well, (photo 11) and again the photo shows quite a level hard core path.  Our final thoughts Very enjoyable few hours, starting off in Kinver with perhaps a coffee break at one of the very few “watering holes” On a dry day a ride through Kinver will raise your spirits, as these woods are delightful whatever the time of year."
1636,"We had no problems with disabled parking at all , The local buses are an excellent service and they are Wheelchair friendly."
1637,Disabled ramp at front door was fine for me but might be a tight fit for a scooter.
1638,"Great visit to the best fish and chip cafe in Scotland! Great disabled parking right outside, gravel at outdoor table area difficult to access, but Owner addressing that. Staff super friendly and very disabled aware.  The owner Sarah has a passion for access and inclusion that was palpable and alive, this blew my mind and made this lunch special"
1639,Usual city parking. On street parking for blue badge outside hours of 12-3
1640,Helpful at table but seemed indifferent to loo problem. 
1641,Friendly staff who were very helpful. 
1642,Arriving and departing from the station was easy with plenty of help to get around and manage getting on and off the trains.
1643,"Level access to enter the centre, automated doors, and open shop front. Accessible loos are available off the main concourse."
1644,We visited two accessible toilets. The one in the Guardroom Square was very busy and access wasn't helped by some 'A' boards blocking wheelchair access. The loo in the Vaults was much better and easier to access.
1645,Accessible adapted toilet facilities in foyer.
1646,"There are four blue badge spaces. These cannot be accessed from the main car park, so if coming from the South you should drive past the entrance to the main car park to the next opening on the right.There are  a few steps up from the main car park, although a wheelchair user could take the slightly longer way round from it by going back out on to the pavement. There is more parking across the road which is also available to the general public, so can get very busy."
1647,Good. But sited in the main building which has a step up on entry.
1648,all pretty cool and made to feel v welcome and no overly patronising staff either :)
1649,Very helpful staff
1650,Dishoom is located in the centre of  the city. We parked in a Disabled space outside the restaurant.  There are plenty of bus stops nearby .The tram is close. The Waverley train station is close.
1651,Steep slopes and crazy paved paths.
1652,"The pavements in West Register Street can be blocked by parked cars, but once you get to the entrance, the garden is easily accessible."
1653,Very friendly and helpful
1654,Very helpful 
1655,"Well equipped with sturdy features. Side transfer space from left of loo seat. Shares space with baby changing. The red cord was too short and strangely it wa located just as inside the door, as far away from pan as possibles. On the day of my visit the lighting was not working but Manager was seeking a solution. "
1656,The airport is wheelchair accessible with 2 automatic doors at the reception of the airport and then it is smooth and level flooring throughout the whole airport.  
1657,Easily accessible - level entrance so perfect for wheelchair/mobility scooter. Decent food at fair price. Spacious inside + Has disabled toilet.
1658,I only used one of the accessible toilets while there and found it perfectly ample..  
1659,"It’s all on the level for you, easy to move around, and a lift is provided. Lots of seating as you get around the hotel."
1660,"Fantastic access, no problems at all."
1661,"Oliva is really nice however the rest are rude and basically throw your Ice Cream at you but lucky for me, I am a world class goalkeeper so I catch them :)"
1662,"Excellent, friendly, attentive and professional. Asked if there was anything else they could do to make me more comfortable"
1663,Door didn't face t u E toilet so in my scooter had to do a 9 point turn and the same out. Once in all was fine.
1664,Access limited by wooden baby changing unit and shortened red cord. No space to side transfer due to position of baby changing unit b
1665,The shop is on Piccadilly and is near to Piccadilly Circus and Green Park tube stations and several buses run  along the street. I travelled on public transport and the bus stop is next door to the shop.
1666,"There is a free parking area located across from the restaurant.  The street the restaurant is located on is on a narrow street.  If being dropped off at the entrance, be sure to watch for cars that occasionally pass through."
1667,"There are two large doors to open and a small lip to get over. It took me a couple tries to get my wheelchair over the bump straight on. Staff will open the door for you but do mind the bump! There is a seating area to wait at, and the front desk is low down which I thought was great. The tattooing area is behind the front desk which was quite quiet when I went. "
1668,Lovely food with a fantastic view over to Lindisfarne
1669, It what I expected but better. Once inside the building I was surprised by the size of the exhibition and the stories it told. The museum and birthplace combine an old traditional weavers cottage with the twentieth century exhibition hall. 
1670,There are a small number of disabled parking spaces on Upper Street. You could also either get a taxi or bus to this venue and then travel the rest of the way in your wheelchair.
1671,The staff are mainly volunteers and are very pleasant and will advise you how to make the best of your visit.
1672,"Now I know the work of Shakespeare is not the easiest to understand, however, visit to the Globe Theatre is a must. The eloquently perform his work in a humorous and delightful way. I have visited the venue twice and each time have been blown away both by the surrounding theatre and performance."
1673,Good. Car park is flat with few disabled spaces. Ground floor easily negotiated. Lift to dining room on first floor.
1674,"The West End Fair is an amazing mix of arts and crafts on display for you to see and buy. Built, in the main, on stilts above a graveyard it is remarkably accessible once you get in. To gain access you do have to transcend a cobbled slope of around 30 metres which may be pushing the boundaries for some wheelchair users. I managed with my powerchair and once down the slope you proceed along the terrace to gain access to the Fair. At the entrance you need to go over a small rough gravel area adjacent to the cafe picnic benches to get in and this is narrow with a clearance of around 70cm. Once beyond this the rest of the journey is easy."
1675,Ramp down to entrance.  Wide door but it is not automatic opening.
1676,"There's not much they've missed - wet room, Clos-o-Mat, shower trolley, shower chairs, ceiling hoists, portable hoist, standing hoist, turner, profiling beds, pressure relief mattresses, scooter charging area, portable loop system, TV hearing system, vibro smoke alarm, flashing doorbell."
1677,Automatic external door and staff happy to open internal doors. All on one level with smooth stone floor. Tactile displays. 
1678,"Parking close to shop entrance, no disabled bay as not needed"
1679,"One small lift from car park into venue, so takes a while waiting to get in. Staff on door were lovely, and insisted we jump the queue!  We sat in a bay at top of the tier, was a bit hard to find but great view and plenty of room."
1680,"Nice, clean, roomy toilet "
1681,Staff are very friendly and helpful; they are useful if help is needed to reach a platform and to provide extra details regarding train travel. They are also very useful to provide ramps for easy access on and off trains.
1682,"This venue has been completely renovated and is now very accessible.  Previously it was totally inaccessible but now there is level access, a disabled toilet and a lift to the gallery floors."
1683,Accesible Museum with easy to read and see displays..  Helpful volunteers. Clean throughout. Outside area overlooking garden.  Restaurant. Accesible toilet which is very clean .
1684,No access for wheelchairs 
1685,"the staff are friendly and helpful, they do listen to people. they sort things out at the football stadium"
1686,"There used to be a small (couple of inches) step to getting the front door, but they have ramped this now."
1687,Level access to bar and function room.
1688,"This famous (some would say infamous) building designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers is well worth a visit even if none if the current exhibitions interests you. There's a restaurant, a cafe, a children's play area and a really good bookshop specialising in art and architecture and the buikding itself is a must-see. Best of all, wheelchair users and accompanists get in free, through the staff entrance, and thus avoid the queues. The website https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/Visite/S-informer-sur-l-accessibilite has plenty of information to help differently abled visitors."
1689,"This is probably the trickiest part of accessing this venue. As it's in the middle of The Meadows, naturally there is no way to drive right up to the circus tents. You'd need to park on the outskirts of the park, or get one of the frequent buses surrounding The Meadows and walk into the middle. The closest direction is probably from George Square Gardens, but there's a little (fairly steep) slope coming down from this. An alternative route is via the Quartermile which connects to Middle Meadow Walk. This is busy, but a nice wide path. Watch out for cyclists in the cycle lane! There are lots of options for reaching the Circus Hub once you're on the edge of the park."
1690,"For my starter I ordered king prawn cocktail. Could have been ten big prawns with slices of avocado and batons of apple with red lettuce leaves (Galactic lettuce?)  It was an unusual combination and excellent. For dessert I had white chocolate parfait with meringue shards, it tasted as good as it looked.  I enjoyed every mouthful. It was very good value for the money."
1691,Very easy to find if you check website befor you arrive as the entrance is on west side (right side) of the building. You then have a short 15 metre push to the main entrance hall.
1692,"My favourite restaurant in Dover, a beautiful position on the beach with terrific views across Dover Harbour. Watch the ferries whilst eating great food."
1693,Toilets are easy to spot. Has many grab-bars and is very clean but is not very large. Fine for average scooter but too small for some larger powerchairs.
1694,There are clearly signed disabled access store at all of the toilets . No radar key required
1695,Very accessible taxi with wheelchair ramps so you can access the taxi.
1696,"Spent a fantastic weekend at The Rings with my family and dog. We loved how peaceful and tranquil it felt and didn't want to leave, However, when we did leave we left feeling the most relaxed we've felt in a very long time. It truly has a home from home feel due to the high standard of accessible features and home comforts. The whole cottage is accessible and it seems like the owners have thought of everything even down to the gravel in the driveway, which sits in a tray so it doesn't move or sink when wheelchairs drive across it. If you’re in need of a break in a beautiful location with high quality features and is fully accessible then I recommend you consider a stay at The Rings. I’m already wishing I was back there!"
1697,"Simply has to be five stars. It's not often you get a cafe in a tent that has a fantastic wheelchair ramp, a loo with room for a dance, and great food and drink!"
1698,"Good signage . Step free access to the site, shop and cafe. The doors are not automatic though, although they are wide. There is step free access to the ponds closest to the shop and the wading area.   The paths are accessible for scooters and wheelchairs in this area, although not tarmac. There is a wave garden which is accessible but not at the beginning. You have to go right to the end to find the ramp.   The large adventure park and soft play are both accessible and there are toilets including disabled ones."
1699,"Toilet was clean, accessible and also had a shower facility."
1700,"The Vindolanda is a Roman Ruin so it is to be accepted that not all of the site is accessable.  The parking and entrance is all level access with easy gradients.  The disabled toilet was at the entrance and was easy to access.  There is a good path all round the outside of the main ruin area. Some parts could be accessed with help in a chair, a bit bumpy and wobbly but it can be done.   There is a very steep slope down to the museum, however the staff informed us when we arrived that you can take the car and park at the museum if you wanted to visit this part, after going round the Vindolanda. This was very handy as the museum was really interesting and the cafe was located there too."
1701,There is no parking in this area the nearest parking would be in the Hallgraig St Car park this is the street that runs parallel with Graham St and can be accessed using one the side streets . The nearest is at the side of Boots however this is a one way street and is always busy.
1702,The toilets were spacious and clean with sufficient hand rails and a lowered sink. The location of the disabled toilet is not great though as it is at the end of the bar in a room usually used for showing football. This meant getting through a lot of people standing around the screens to get to the toilet. 
1703,"There are disabled parking bays on the Morrisons side of the station close to the entrance, there is a dropped kerb near the station entrance door. There is also parking available in the Morrisons multi story car park, there are two disabled bays at entrance level, there is an automatic door and lifts that will take you into Morrisons where you can exit and cross the road to the station.   There is a taxi rank on the Mount Pleasant Road side of the station. Ringing ahead for an accessible taxi would be advisable as not all are accessible. Bus stops are also on this road."
1704,A few disabled bays available on George Street.   Central location means it will be connected to local bus and tram route.
1705,Because of my size and weight I only book 1E. I have sat in 2E on the A319 and 3E on an A320 the 319 is fractional smaller between the seats over the 320 in such my two knees wouldn't go behind the seat in front. I am 1.88 tall so worth thinking about this if you are the same size or over.
1706,"Churchill way is literally yards away with free parking for blue badges, or the cinema is within the capital centre which has parking too."
1707,"The staff were really helpful and apart from the point I made above, they couldn't have done any more to improve my experience."
1708,"When they send forms to you prior to going to Calvert they ask about specific needs of access. There are ceiling track hoists in lots of bedrooms, a wheelchair charging room, high needs bathroom, profile beds, changing facilities.  The list is huge, it is all listed on the website, there is a totally accessible swimming pool and changing area, a sensory room, all doors inside the building are automatic. Staff are on duty all of the time and every activity is totally accessible for any need"
1709,"We had brought our own toilet frame which we used as my brother, who is a wheelchair user, had broken his foot in November and was not steady on his feet and we used this in conjunction with those available in the property"
1710,"Not a strong staff presence around the hotel. Chef on duty was helpful, Bar Staff/ Server not so friendly and brought us the wrong drinks"
1711,Great if coming by car as there are loads of disabled parking bays. It is a little more tricky if arriving by bus as there is a very large and lengthy ramp to negotiate down from the bus stop to the shopping centre.
1712,The best of the best! Couldn't have been friendlier.
1713,Staff were friendly and helpful.
1714,Staff are always very friendly and happy to help 
1715,Large car-park at rear - always spaces. No/very rare public transport nearby.
1716,As on the day I visited there was engineering works and hence no trains to Victoria so I travelled by train to Waterloo and took a taxi.
1717,a large door with level access was fine to roll my powerchair in once my friend held it open.   There are lots of tables and chairs and first impressions from the outside were that it might be tight. Once inside however there is actually plenty of space between the tables. Might have something to do with cafe being  favourite spot with young parents and children in buggies.
1718,"The accessible toilet is beside the café and I would say it’s fairly spacious however, you’d only be able to transfer at the right-hand side of the toilet as it’s against the wall at the other side. I would say the only 2 main problems were that there was no emergency red cord and the doors kept bouncing away from the door so were hard for my friend to keep open so that I could get out.  I don’t think there’s a Changing Places toilet nearby."
1719,Great access and nice and helpful staff.
1720,"This being our 2nd visit ,the 1st time was ok , i have to say i couldn't wait to leave  this time... food took an eternity ... staff where unhelpfull and unapologetic for the poor service and even poorer quality of the  meal  We are both registered blind one of us is a wheelchair user  ...no menu in large print ...staff unhelpfull regarding telling what was on the menu Access wasn't brilliant but passable "
1721,"On a busy city centre road there isn't much scope for parking. There is a drop off area which is handy. That said, I arrived by tram and from the West End it was a ten minute walk."
1722,There are no steps into the main building and there are two disabled toilets - one inside - and one outside. Part of the picnic area is not accessible at the moment but work is in progress right now (10th August 2015) which will redress this problem soon. (Author's recommendation).  There is a stretch of gravel pathway before meeting the boardwalk which can be bypassed by allowing disabled drivers to drive close to the boardwalk by speaking to someone in the information centre or by mobile telephone from the car. The boardwalk from then on circles all permitted areas of the reserve.
1723,There were a lot of steps and the main entrance had a lot of large bumps I couldn't get over in my wheelchair unassisted. The step into every entrance door was large and they had no ramps they could get for me
1724,"Once inside the main club, there is a wheelchair accessible toilet which can be accessed via a radar key which is kept behind the bar. Again, this is often out of order or used as a storage facility, so do call in advance."
1725,"Lovely accessible toilet, clearly marked with a ramp up to it. There was a separate baby changing area so there was't a queue for the loo which was great. The toilet had a number of grab rails (see photo) and was spotless, despite being at the heart of the holiday season. Perfect!"
1726,Staff were very friendly and helpful.
1727,Easy to find . Clean
1728,I approached the Galleria from the London Bridge side. It was easy to wheel in with just a small section of cobbles to wheel over by the arched entrance. Once in the main space it was easy to get around and to go and see the river views.
1729,"Getting to hotel is easy enough if you follow Sat NAV carefully, but it is a little difficult to get into hotel itself, as you can only use the pull door outside, so you will need help, but it’s just about wide enough to get wheelchairs through and into reception, but getting out I needed to pull my husband through the narrow door. We are not sure about any powerchairs though, you would have to check with hotel first.  It’s all on the level, and two lifts are available and quite a good size, so no worries there. We could see and get to everything we needed. Lots of seating areas to relax in."
1730,The prom stretches for miles and can be accessed the whole way along. There is a slight camber to it but otherwise a great place for views of the bay and over to the lake district. There are car parks or road side parking options. There are public toilets on the prom near the clock tower (poss need a radar key). Or we have used facilities at The Midland Hotel & Morrisons supermarket. 
1731,"Fantastic Changing Places Facility.  You need to ask for the code to get in, but it’s beautifully clean and well equipped.  "
1732,There are 3 blue badge spaces in the middle parking bay. There is a path towards the courtyard which has a fairly steep gradient but is suitable for wheelchairs.
1733,It's a funky quirky building - and the disabled access follows that theme! Don't be put off by the steps at the front of the building - the main accessible entrance is around the side. Our show was in one of the rooms on the Ground Floor - which we accessed easily from the Courtyard. The Courtyard houses several bars and food outlets during festival time - but although busy it was fairly easy to navigate. 
1734,Mrs Crosby is the best teacher ever! And Elaine/ mr odonnel help anyone with needs.
1735,"Some of my family, friends and I stayed in the Drummochy house at Homelands during the Easter weekend which is fully wheelchair accessible and sleeps 8 people. It was a very relaxing, enjoyable weekend away and we had beautiful sunshine all weekend."
1736,All the cottages have ground floor accessible access with ceiling hoists from bed to shower. 
1737,"No one can deny bar home has tried to make itself an accessible bar in a great area in Glasgow. Albion street has street parking and relatively good paths, with a heavy glass door it is a little awkward to get into but its wide with a slight ramp. The bar is open during the day and serves pretty good food as well as great selection of drinks. The bar has a very good sized disabled toilet which uses the radar key system. Great for during day as its table service however a pretty high bar so would be difficult for people to order from there. Weekend nights although accessible are incredibly busy"
1738,"From memory, at least one disabled toilet on each floor."
1739,"Ground floor access, help bell outside, automatic door"
1740,There ground is rough but manageable. The main cafe is outdoors and has ramped access to the decking. You do have to cross grass to get to the ramp which is a shame as this can make your wheels unnecessarily messy. The rear cafe is a converted large greenhouse and the staff will willingly come and set up a ramp for you.
1741,"Booking staff were very helpful, telling me where to go and what would happen.  They were spot on.   As soon as we arrived at the front of the theatre, a staff member spotted us in the crowd and was at our side before we knew it.  He got someone to fetch our tickets from the box office, then that person took me round the side where another staff member met us.   We used a separate entrance with a wheelchair lift to dress circle level.  My daughter came too.  He took us to our seats, showed me the loo, showed me where my chair was."
1742,"Ocean Terminal is one of the most accessible venues I know. Nando's is located on the top floor and is new to the venue. The staff were helpful, the food delicious. There was one issue and this was with the accessible toilet. The door would not close properly so I was not able to use the toilet on this occasion. I did mention this to a member of staff so hopefully the issue has been resolved."
1743,The man on the desk was exceptionally helpful. The other staff were friendly too. 
1744,A whole row of parking spaces dedicated to disabled people
1745,"Friendly, helpful, courteous, attentive."
1746,"This branch has just opened in Edinburgh. It's conveniently located, staff are great, it's spacious and has some of Barclays great accessible facilities."
1747,"Good, clean, well appointed toilet but difficult for chair users because of that narrow turn."
1748,"Access to the shopping centre is excellent, with level floors, automatic doors, plenty of space to manoeuvre a wheelchair for example and lifts to the first floor"
1749,Good use of space and accessible for all but the biggest powered chairs.
1750,"The museum was very modern and easy to navigate. Even the disabled access toilets had automatic door buttons and the lift was a good size. I borrowed a manual wheelchair as I need to manage my pain, energy and exercise through each day. I enjoyed the Stanley Kubrick exhibition and the free exhibitions. There were many things to see and easy to access displays."
1751,"There are 3 converted cottages on this site, 2 x 3 bedroom and 1 x 2 bedroom. The owners have thought of everything for the disabled user. Obviously wheelchair access, all on one level and solid oak non slip flooring. Really large wet rooms in 3 bed cottages, and wheeled shower chairs supplied. They can provide a profile bed and organise the hire of other equipment such as power chairs etc. Excellent kitchen and lounge space with large fold back doors to easy access patio looking over open countryside. Our only criticism was the small 'cloakroom sized sink in the wet room, however there is also a family bathroom with normal sink. Ample parking for 3 or more vehicles."
1752,"Disabled parking right outside reception and near to rooms. Given 4 stars purely because the 2 spaces provided might prove to be inadequate at busier times in Cornwall. January is not peak season after all and both spaces were in use ( one by us , I hasten to add)"
1753,The staff we met were cheerful and very helpful.
1754,The loo in my bedroom had everything that I required.
1755,"There is no parking at the museum. Limited on-street pay-and-display parking is available on Trumpington Street. The museum is approximately 10 minutes' walk from the city centre, where the Grand Arcade car park has accessible blue badge spaces, and accessible bus services pass down Trumpington Street."
1756,"There are more parking spaces here than they could ever use and quite a few are marked disabled, though perhaps a little subtly. A lot were used by non-blue badge vehicles but there are so many it really isn't an issue."
1757,"On my arrival the dropped kerb was blocked so I had to phone reception for help. Outer doors easily accessible. Low accessible counter at reception. I think there may be two accessible bed rooms.  See photos for mine which was a bit tight for manoeuvring but manageable as I was the sole occupant. The other room had more space and the only double bed in the hostel. My room was via two card operated doors which were not easy, but not impossible, to negotiate.  Anyone around was very helpful. No induction loop or 'alternative formats' noted."
1758,There are lifts inside the building. Sadly wheelchair users can't make use of the escalators on the outside of the building. Circulating spaces inside are excellent.
1759,i went to Brent Cross to meet my peer mentor at Wagammas we were not able to go as both lifts to food court were being refurbished and 3rd lift was out of order.  We ended  up going to a restaurant in Fenwick which was ok.  But we were on ground floor and had to go to 3rd floor for accessible toilets which were through the men's toilets.  I had to ask for help a) find toilets b). Open door.
1760,Plenty of parking space and easy access to all shop and the mall. 
1761,Staff are very friendly and will do whatever they can to help you. Booking staff are very knowledgeable and will suggest the best seats for your needs.
1762,"There is a very small ramp to one side of the building, this had a handrail. The shop isles are very wide and would easily allow wheelchairs down the isles.  There were signs located around the buildings pointing out different shopping areas, signs were bold and very clear. There were steps as well as a lift big enough for two wheelchairs.  Access to the restaurant was made easy via the life, there was also plenty of the seats in the restaurant as well as outside the shop. "
1763,The club has dissabled parking and elevator access via their rear doors on Rose Street although calling in advance to confirm your parking is definitely recommended
1764,"I was sent to park at the top of the steep hill, right by the castle entrance."
1765,"It is reasonably wheelchair friendly farm, (1) entrance to shop is easy enough, (2) door normally open, wheelchair friendly walk around, (3)  minimal selection of bread and fruit (4) veg counter very little choice (5) a reasonable selection of cheese (6) with a good area for young children to play, plus a farm like zoo to walk around (3*).  Our overall view of farm is not very good, not at all appealing, rather untidy and in need of work. "
1766,"Lifts were available, there was ample access to the main auditorium through every entrance. Accessible seats were available for those who wished to transfer and those who wished to stay in their wheelchair."
1767,"Level entry to reception. Automatic entry on approaching door, push pad to exit. Wide corridors and doorways to all rooms. Lifts to upstairs and basement level rooms. "
1768,"The wheelchair access was very good, the lift was large enough for one power chair user plus a carer or friend. The buttons were located on the side of the lift rather than at the far end which means that my wife could operate the lift without my assistance (which I appreciate as I don't like lifts). The staff were helpful and friendly. When asked if they could provide a different cup for my wife's decaf coffee they went above and beyond by getting a fresh one for her, most places will get pour the current coffee into the new cup.   "
1769,"Not all disabled people want to have to do their shopping from at the door, some like to browse!  Shops need to have much more awareness of how much space you need to get about with a wheelchair as most of them are virtually inaccessible due to the amount of stock they have out on the shop floor and the lack of space between the display units. Disabled parking in multi-storey largely reserved for shopmobility, that which isn't reserved is very expensive."
1770,There is only one toilet per gender and if someone is in there with children you will wait for quite a while. This is a very popular restaurant so plan your bathroom visit well.
1771,"Not bad really.  Location wasn't great if you were looking for night life etc, but I just needed a place to sleep when getting my wheelchair fixed.  The entrance was level and had electric doors which opened into a wee vestibule, lifts to the left, stair to the right.  Reception was up on the 1st floor. Unfortunately there was a pull door to get to the desk, and we had to wait a little while as the receptionist didn't see us and there was no bell.  She was pleasant enough.  Got our key and set off back to the lift up to the rooms.  Nice spacious hallway leading to our massive room!  There was enough space to have a party, and the shower room was pretty big too.  The bed was a little low for me, but so comfy and the pillows were perfect.  I use a CPAP machine at night and struggled to find a socket close enough, thankfully the cord is really long.   We didn't opt for breakfast included as it was almost £20 for two and seeing what was on offer I'm glad, it was all microwaved. There was a small restaurant next-door (it was shut for repainting) and a Subway too."
1772,Great parking. Shopmobility. Changing Places facilities. Friendly.
1773, There is a   Disabled toilet. 
1774,All staff that I met were very helpful and friendly The gardens are staffed by volunteers and some days there are very few members of staff available in the gardens if assistance is needed. 
1775,"The door to the accessible toilet is directly off the seating area. The toilet was clean and spacious with grab rails. There is no emergency cord, but I think given location I think if you called out for help you would be easily heard. "
1776,There is an accessible toilet along the walkway between the auditorium and restaurant. It was clean and tidy and had enough for a carer or to maneuver walking aids or wheelchairs. There is also an emergency alarm button beside the toilet. 
1777,More disabled parking could be available nearer the facilities.
1778,The staff in all the shops that he visited it were very very friendly and more than willing to help to move things or bring things to me if I was unable to access them. All the shopkeepers and shop assistants were very Covid compliant and all of that hand sanitiser on entry to their shops and advised people of the rules around wearing masks. I have to admit that this made my first trip out a more positive and reassuring one for me as a disabled person.
1779,"We ate lunch outside at this hidden gem. The food exceeded our expectations and tasted very fresh. I would highly recommend the beetroot and goats cheese ravioli, it was delicious! As was the chocolate and orange torte. "
1780,Staff helpful and offered to carry beverages to a table.
1781,Helpful.
1782,"Balloch train station is nearby - a couple minutes walk along the street. This is a small train station and not always staffed - so only basic facilities there.  There are local buses in the area.   La Cucina has its own small car park behind the restaurant (I'm unsure how many disabled parking places as we didn't use it). You can usually also get parked on the street to the side of the restaurant, which is free.   The road immediately outside the restaurant is the main street, so I would avoid parking there if you can. "
1783,There is an accessible bathroom for people with mobility problems
1784,"Great place to visit, some severe restrictions for the less mobile wheelchair user"
1785,All the loos are accessible some with more room than others but I found them all quite easy to use.  All had sufficient room to manoeuvre a self propelled wheel chair and there were.sufficient grab rails
1786,"Room was very small, asked for bed to be raised for hoist access, which it was but the bed was left in the middle of the room, so no room to get passed. Thick carpet in room made pushing hoist extremely difficult."
1787,There's an accessable loo near the accessable spots in the circle. It has its own door so no queing or trying to get passed other patrons. Perfect.
1788,Awkward.  No lift between sections required leaving the building and entering through a fire exit - with a too steep ramp.  
1789,"To get to the disabled toilet, you need to ask the steward who opens the door for you. When you're in the toilet, it is very spacious and I could easily turn my mobility scooter! "
1790,"Wide double doors and step-free entrance into the restaurant. The doors aren't automatic, but the first set is propped open. Inside, there are lots of tables - many with removable chairs. It's quite dimly lit inside, but the street windows and bright colours help. The restaurant is level access, and there is a good amount of room to move between tables. There are also tables and chairs on the street, but it's a little bit tight for space."
1791,Plenty of room for a wheelchair and grab handles. The let down was the shower over the bath which was unable to use. No wet room
1792,Staff were friendly and helpful. When checking our tickets on the tram they asked where we would be getting off. They then passed this info on to the driver so he could give us extra time at our stop to get off.
1793,The entrance on Shandwick Place is clearly marked with a wheelchair symbol so this is the best door for anyone with mobility issues or a wheelchair user.
1794,"All staff were very helpful and friendly, both on my outward and return journeys. Special assistance had been pre-booked and all the staff were very helpful, polite and friendly. They ensured that I got to my plane safely and on time. "
1795,"This cafe is located within the Findhorn Foundation which is situated just before the village of Findhorn. It has a beautiful atmosphere - surrounded by trees and the sound of birdsong. The menu is mostly organic and vegan and offers a wide variety of tasty food to try.  The staff were very helpful and welcoming; this really added to the overall experience of being inside this chilled out green space. It is possible to sit either inside or out and there is plenty of space to manoeuvre throughout; if you have any trouble, I'm sure the staff would be happy to help you in any way that they could.  Overall, it's a really nice calm place to relax in and perfect for a day out at Findhorn Community."
1796,"Wet room facilities were excellent, plenty of space, grab rails, access for shower chair over toilet."
1797,Maps showing scooter routes are available. Almost the whole site is accessible.
1798,"We used the car, not really feasible to use public transport "
1799,Accessible toilet with room to move around in and fit a carer in. Plenty of grab rails. Found the emergency red cord hanging freely to the floor and left a Red Cord Card.  It was clean and tidy. There was also no pedal bins which is great when you don't have full use of your legs as I've found in so many accessible loos pedal bins and they you're left wondering how to open the bin! There was also a good size clinical waste pin. The toilets where easy-ish to find.
1800,"Toilet accessible. Shower with no lip, owner had put in a seat for me."
1801,"Very well catered for, got to ride in the private lift."
1802,Access to get to the boat is ok and when getting on and off the staff put ramps down so wheelchairs can get aboard. However once you are on the boat the only way to get below deck is several steep steps. This would be ok if the weather was nice but you can’t rely on good weather in Lake District! Wouldn’t recommend for wheelchair users.
1803,"Amazing food, very good access."
1804,Glasshouse Cafe staff very pleasant and provided ramp and moved furniture to enable me to reach a comfortable table. Would not be a good pace to go when busy. The outside cafe (not open all year so check the website) is much more spacious.
1805,Car park at building. Railway Station 500m level route.
1806,Level access to the cottage with a small ramp to the door
1807,"They seemed fine, in good order and clean"
1808,"People in the Centre were really friendly and helpful. Clearing space, helping to see things on their stalls, and generally welcoming."
1809,Adjacent to the lounge area was an accessible toilet. It was large and well appointed.
1810,"Cannot comment on parking and bus stops as I don't really know Edinburgh that well. I travelled by train and got off at Waverly station, at first we needed to use Google map to find out how to get to where we were going. Once we figured it out though we found it much easier to get from the train station, to George Square Gardens and back again."
1811,"The toilet is accessible, clean and basic; there is no emergency cord but it is spacious and there are grab rails.  It is also used as a baby-changing facility and it stored a mop and bucket which could be a problem for some people with mobility problems."
1812,Staff were helpful.
1813,On site parking is free and buses stop outside this  venue  We had a taxi from the Railway Station and we were dropped off at the door of the Art Gallery.
1814,Helpful staff
1815,The toilet facilities are at the back of the cafe and are spacious and accessible with generous space for carer and chair. The pathway is clear though it may be trickier to navigate at busier times.
1816,"This there is disabled access, including a wider door to the side of the building."
1817,Both staff and volunteers were very welcoming and ensured everyone was safe but also enjoying the walk.
1818,"Friendly staff, happy to help. Unsure of how many would be able to communicate using BSL."
1819,"I was using a medium sized 4 wheel scooter and stupidly drove into the disabled toilet in the historical military section, managed to stretch and close inward opening door, when finished could not open door, but with extreme difficulty managed to escape, only to find problem with inward opening main, thank fully charming young mother with baby let me out from the communal disabled/baby change area. Castle experience otherwise thoroughly enjoyable"
1820,The shop is on the High Street in the town centre within a pedestrianised zone so there is no parking on site. There are disabled bays within the town centre but it is difficult to get a spot there. There are also car parks within a nearby shopping centre and in and around the town centre itself.  
1821,There are disabled toilets accessible at the rear of each stand.  They are very roomy and can accommodate Wheelchairs and mobility scooters with plenty of room for carers.  They were clean and well looked after when I was there.
1822,"Ramped access on & off ship, movable bench creating a large deck space with fixed seats on both sides. Toilet had a step into it."
1823,On street parking  with 1 disabled bay beside restaurant or large free public car park about 500 meters to rear.  Bus stop 100 meters. We drove.
1824,"The Main Bedroom with en-suite wet-room (probably the best I can recall, always hot water, surfaces to accommodate toiletries etc. (a major fault I find in holiday wet rooms)"
1825,No signage showing where the beach chair facility is
1826,It was spacious easy to move around disability toilet nice people 
1827,"ramp from driveway into bungalow, most bedrooms downstairs with one upstairs. ground floor with good level access throughout"
1828,Always friendly and helpful.
1829,"Reception , shop and cafe  have ramped access, wide enough for a mobility scooter or wheelchair. An all ability trail has recently been constructed in the woodland area by the Loch. "
1830,Kind and friendly staff
1831,"As well as the train station being approx 10 mins away, there is also designated accessible car parking areas. These car parks are still some distance away from the course but if you phone the access line beforehand you can get into the car park that is closest to the course."
1832,All staff were extremely friendly and helpful - I didn't have much contact due to being with my partner but everyone we met took on my access requirements (speaking directly face on so that I can lipread) and helping out as much as they could without being annoyingly overbearing (like lots of people can be!)
1833,"I am not a wheelchair user, but did visit Thirsty on behalf of someone who is.   The bar area itself is accessible with only a slight (1"") ledge to cope with. The staff seemed friendly and willing to help with my questions.  The drinks have to be taken from a set of fridges by the customer and paid for at the (quite tall) bar. If you're in a wheelchair, you'd probably need to ask for help, especially for top shelf drinks. Payment is by wireless card reader, so they could pass that to you.   The difficulty looks to be with getting to the function room at the back. It's all single level,  and they tell me that wheelchair users have been through, but it's quite a narrow corridor, with right angle turns. My friend who uses a powered chair thought they would not be able to get past.   If performing, it might be possible to arrange to enter via the alley and fire exit at the back, but we didn't try this.   People do seem to bring dogs, so I'm sure guide dogs would be especially welcome. "
1834,"I didn’t interact much with the staff myself because my helper went up to order for me due to it being busy but, I was sitting next to the customer counter. They were very friendly with all customers that came in, chatting, asking how their day was and making everyone feel welcome.  During any of my visits to any Costa Coffee’s I feel staff have always been great, it definitely makes me want to return."
1835,The loo is set the back of the cafe they will give you a key it's low rent but otherwise perfect for what is required
1836,No ramps or lifts required to access main site... Excellent walkways around the site and friendly ramps to access toilets
1837,Staff were helpful and seemed quite approachable. It may be worth getting a tour of the site with a staff member when arriving as it's quite easy to take the long way around instead of the short cuts when going to the bedrooms and restaurants (like I did)!
1838,Very welcoming and helpful. One of the curators gave us free samples of cheese and 5en escorted us to the audio-visual display area - wheelchair users access this via a platform lift - and turned on the English language version of the film for us. Both staff members we met speak English and both were alert to the needs of wheelchair users.
1839,"Fully accessible living accommodation and accessible garden with patio area and raised beds, specifically designed for wheelchair users. The open plan kitchen/living area has patio doors leading to the garden.  There are three bedrooms, two of which are wheelchair accessible, sleeping up to 6 people. One bedroom has a ceiling tracking hoist, and a height adjustable single profiling bed with air mattress. The other single bed has head and leg raisers. The ensuite wetroom is equipped with 2 different types of shower chair. The sink is height adjustable.   The kitchen has a fridge, freezer, microwave, dishwasher, induction hob and oven. There is a height adjustable hob, workspace and sink.   There are 2 parking spaces at the door."
1840,Excellent access to the spacious disabled toilet
1841,Best chips I've had in a while but the wheelchair access is not great. The staff were very helpful however.
1842,Very good supermarket for disabled all flat and disabled toilets available 
1843,Small car park but still had disabled space
1844,Large car park but only two disabled spaces. Although they where the closest ones to the entrance.
1845,A great venue with wheelchair accessible restaurant friendly staff and great adventures with side by side cycles also hand bikes and accessible sailing all in one place with wheelchair accessible speed boats what a way to spend the day booking in advance is always better 
1846,Easy Access for my carer who has to push my chair.
1847,You access the train by ramp. It is important to arrange this (free) assistance at least 24 hours before travelling. The ramp is deployed by trained employees and assistance is available to wheelchair users who cannot self propelled.
1848,Staff were extremely friendly and helpful
1849,Very good and helpful to our group. Showed us some of the equipment
1850,Nice and easy to get in through the doors.
1851,Enjoyed a good meal with other Euan's Guide ambassadors and Euan himself. Flat access to spacious restaurant. Space to park my scooter. Toilets accessible but quite small. Happy to adapt to particular food requirements. 
1852,The nearest step-free tube stations are Tottenham Court Road and Green Park. Both have notoriously unreliable lifts - check before you travel.  Loads of buses run up and down nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.
1853,Easily accesible toilet/shower wetroom with sliding door
1854,There are several car parks around the shopping centre; all of the car parks have disabled parking and non-disabled spaces.  The building can be easily accessed from these spaces via pedestrian walkways and lowered curbs.
1855,"The museum recreates the story of a wealthy family everyday life in Corfu Town in the 1800s. A guide accompanies you through the rooms of a restored town house describing how live would have been like for its former occupants. There are several animated figures and alongside the historic décor, charmingly bring the stories to life. There is a cost for visiting this museum. "
1856,"Accessible room available, although doorways and public areas quite narrow, making manoeverability difficult with a wheelchair. However, accessible accommodation is in very short supply, so fabulous to be able to get somewhere to stay in Oban, in town. Close to local amenities, and attractions. Staff really friendly, and offer assistance. Breakfast is a refreshing change from full English or Scottish fry ups."
1857,Unfortunately these were all out of order. 
1858,"Can't fault it!  Corridors wide and smooth, only step I found was into the table football room."
1859,"There  were staff about everywhere who were eager to assist and point you in the right direction, assistance which is needed to get to the 3, 4 and 5."
1860,One disabled bay outside the store. Several wheelchair accessible buses run near the store including Indigo & i4 (Trent Barton). 
1861,"Being a football fan as well as a Sheffield United fan I want to travel to any football match to enjoy football! Next on the list was the Euro 2016 Quarterfinal between France and Iceland at the Stade de France. I am unfortunately confined to a wheelchair football grounds can sometimes seem daunting experiences: where is the accessible parking, where are the seats, are they accessible, where are there disabled toilets etc.? Watching football fills people with joy and with an understanding of the problems you might encounter, I want to share my experiences of football grounds with you so you can feel a bit more confident about stadium accessibility in the future. "
1862,"No steps, easy roll in with my mobility scooter, and plenty of room to move about "
1863,Informative
1864,"There is an excellent, spacious accessible toilet on the ground floor that is accessible with a radar key "
1865,"The door staff were lovely and friendly, but when I arrived they said I need to go to the box office but they changed the seats around which is never good to hear! We went to the box office and it hadn't been changed. When I went in and a staff member was to take me to my seat they walked me down the centre then just pointed at the other side of the room and I was a bit scared I wouldn't be able to see as I was at another gig lately where I was in a similar seat at the front but so far to the side I couldn't see, I asked the staff member and she just said ""go to box office but its sold out"" so not exactly helpful, but it turned out ok! My seat/ space was 'Stalls C 8 and C7'"
1866,there plenty of disabled spaces & there bus stops nearby
1867,The are 3 disabled parking spaces outside the Maid of the Forth ticket office
1868,"Very helpful and friendly, willing and able to answer queries,"
1869,Staff were friendly and welcoming. 
1870,"Being a building on the busy Royal Mile; parking is not easy. but is possible in adjacent streets. Buses however, stop right outside or its a 15 to 20 minute walk from Waverley Railway Station."
1871,The cafe is up on the old platform in the old waiting room. It’s a steep ramp to get up on to the platform. The entry to the cafe is step free at the front but has a step down to exit at the back. You can also get to the seating areas by coming back out the front and round the side. There is a marquee at platform level with seating in or down the ramp there is a level floor hexagonal covered seating area or a wooden area but this has a step. 
1872,There are two pay and display car parks to the town centre. Albion centre car park is closest with free parking for badge holders in designated bays. I find these bays are often full. The second car park (Pimlico Street) is usually emptier but further to walk.   If you need to access mobility equipment shopmobility is located  close to Erewash Museum and there is a car park for members. It is only open Thursday and Saturday (9am to 2:30pm). There is a form to complete to become a member.  Bus stops are either up or down a hill. 
1873,"I couldn't find anything negative to say about the reserve or the people who work there. The visitor centre is great. There is a shop with a good selection of wildlife books, gifts and a nice selection of quality feeders and bird food."
1874,All of the staff from the start to the end of the tour are very warm friendly and make you welcome they will assist you as best they can and are happy to answer questions about the club and of course they will take photos for you in any area of the tour if you ask them 
1875,"If I could rate the staff an 11 here I would. From the Admin to the receptionist to the shops to the staff in the museum, I have yet to encounter a single person who didn't do their best to make this an accessible experience. They allowed me to top up my chair's charge, they gave my dog water, they helped but didn't ""overhelp"".  Staff have an amazing attitude, love their work, and want to make the day a good one. Couldn't fault staff at a stretch.  We've been here many times: it's always the same. People here love their work, and their customers."
1876,A Radar Key disabled toilet with good amount of grab rails. Lever tap. 
1877,Spacious disabled toilet available.
1878,There is parking right outside the Bunkhouse. There is no public transport on the island.
1879,A member of staff appeared at the interval to take us to the toilet. The space in the loo wasn't great for manoeuvring around but was clean and tidy. 
1880,A large car park with plenty of disabled bays (I would say the only problem is drivers using these without a badge).  The centre is on a main bus route too.
1881,Spaces are limited close to the venue
1882,"There is an accessible loo - you need to ask the staff for the code to access the door which leads to it. The corridor is quite narrow, with a 90 degree turn into the loo, which was a bit tricky. The loo itself is small - I don’t think side transfer would be possible - but sensibly equipped with grab rails and a wash basin."
1883,"The positives were level entry into the entrance, shop and museum.  Most of the site is grass and it is hilly in places, which was fine in my mountain trike, though tiring but might have been very difficult in some chairs.  All of the ruins are in fenced areas and down steps... mostly long flights of steps. These were completely inaccessible for me. I could take photos from outside but that was about it. "
1884,"The centre has been newly rebuilt and redesigned in 2016 from the former inverclyde sports centre which was in the same location for many years.  The centre now has large lifts, accessibile sports hall which can be hired for £8 an hour. There are also accessible toilets complete with adult changing bench and hoist. At the moment the change bench is not adjustable. Hopefully this will change soon. The upper floors have accessible sleeping accommodation with hoists and adjoining rooms for  a Personal assistant. From what I saw the beds are not profiling beds."
1885,All venues were accessible (no steps) except for one.  Venues were busy but there was room to get around.  Seating for wheelchair users was typically front row.
1886,"Paula and Nigel, the owners, were very welcoming and explained how everything worked and were happy to recommend places to go. They made sure we had their mobile number if we needed to contact them."
1887,We parked in a disabled bay off the Main Street then it was all flat & pedestrianised to get to the restaurant. 
1888,"The cinema is housed in an old art deco style building. There is a step free entrance and on the ground floor is the foyer, café and main auditorium.  The entrance door is power assisted but when I visited just before the performance it was open. Both screens have wheelchair spaces. I visited Screen 1 and I was permitted into the auditorium about 5 minutes before the public so I could get seated. The main auditorium gently slopes and the aisles are wide. There is also an upper balcony which I think is only accessible by stairs. Their Screen 2 is smaller and is located in their basement and is has step free access by lift. I didn't see this when I visited, but it is a smaller auditorium.  They regularly screen films with subtitles. Guide dogs are welcome and their website states ""We can provide drinking water for your guide dog and are happy to look after him/her during your screening. "" "
1889,Very helpful staff that are ready to open doors and answer your questions with out any qualms.
1890,The toilets were clean and easy access. However there were no paper towels and some learners were unsure of the electric dryers.
1891,Having to pay for disabled parking isn't great but many places have that - accessibility is fine though.
1892,Large flat entrance with very wide automatic doors.
1893,There is a reasonable sized car park right nearby with 5 disabled spaces right next to the ticket machine. Parking is free on Sundays. This venue is just behind the High Street so there are plenty of buses.
1894,The toilets are located to the back of the Costa Coffee and access is via two doors and a turn to the left.  There are two toilets these are for both male and female and one of the toilets is accessible. Very happy to note that the Red Cord was down all the way to the floor.
1895,"There's a woodland walk from the car park (charge payable) down to the viewpoint.  Crossing the road from the car park requires a bit of help as there's no dropped kerb on the far side and no crossing (so care needed spotting cars, which travel quite fast on this section of road). There's a bit of a bump in the first bit of path, but after that it's a gentle trundle on firm paths more or less all the way down - only the very last short section is inaccessible (steps). Spectacular waterfall. Charges apply - buy tickets in ticket office in car park."
1896,"Everywhere you need to go is accessible with plenty of room, there are some tables that are up a few steps but it's so big on the flat part you'd never struggle to get a table that's accessible. "
1897,"Hotel has had a refurbishment, so pleased to see they now have an accessible loo in public areas, before you had to get a member of staff to take you through the reception room to an accessible loo. Loo was roomy with plenty of grab rails etc."
1898,"accessible restaurant with handy parking, modern menu, not too expensive with great views of carrickfergus castle and harbour."
1899,These are situated to the back of the cafe.
1900,"The accommodation was very accessible, with hoist in bedroom and bathroom, adaptable kitchen unit (depending on height), spacious and well maintained lodge and there was lots of information available on the other attractions available in the local area. "
1901,"The golf course is across the road from Dawlish train station. The station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. There are also step free, local buses that stop opposite the golf course."
1902,"Every staff member we encountered were extremely helpful and very friendly. The staff at information were more than happy to tell us what areas of the reserve was best for accessibility and tell us all about the place. It shone through they were very passionate about what they do. The staff in the restaurant were amazing too, as with minimal fuss just asked us what we wanted and said they would bring it to the table for us and moved any seats we wanted so we could get our wheelchairs in."
1903,All staff everywhere were adorably and unobtrusively helpful and friendly. Especially so in the basement café. Full marks.
1904,"Got  a bus from city centre, bus stop about 100 meters from venue. "
1905,From the outside the cafe looked to be busy and might be a challenge. Once inside it was actually very good.
1906,Great bathroom in the room with grab rails and excellent wheel in shower with shower chair. Took half a star off as no red cord and the mirror is too high for someone in a wheelchair 
1907,Helpful
1908,Shame there aren't disable toilets as I'd go back.
1909,"Poor.   only 4 disabled parking spots in the near vicinity. Others are not near enough to be accesssible if one has to push a wheelchair or walk with sticks or any other form of restriction.    Although a ""five minute"" walk is fine for the physically able, this could well be much further.  There is a drop off point but this is useless if the  driver is disabled. "
1910,"Wheelchair accessible restaurant and cafe with helpful, friendly staff in great venue near to the Holy Island (Lindisfarne) and Bamburgh Castle."
1911,"All but a few exhibits on the level access in a single room. A video  constantly plays to show you what is upstairs. There is one route around the exhibit  - following short pile carpet with rope barriers either side. You can not touch the cars but there are smells of petrol/oil/ 'shed', 'dust' and 'hanger' to take it! Printer booklet describing the car's history. Accessible toilet and tea room."
1912,Flat step free entrance. Enough space between tables. Low counter for paying. Easy access to disabled toilet. 
1913,Automated doors and wide enough for wheelchair access. Lift available to access upper floors.
1914,Very helpful
1915,Accessible Toilets (Public Areas)  An accessible toilet is located toward the far side of the reception and adjacent to the lift. The door clearance for the accessible toilet is 86 cm.  There were other accessible toilets in the dining room area as well.
1916,"This place caught our eye when we saw signs to it on our way to Malin Head (Ireland's most northerly point), and we were glad we went to have a look. ""Famine Village"" sounds a bit grim - and trust me, as a British visitor you will hear some stuff about your Victorian ancestors that does not make you proud - but it's as much a museum of Irish rural life in better times as a place that tells the story of a tragedy. A major bonus was the tour given by a man who had actually lived in one of the traditional houses there as a child in the 1970s and early 1980s, and he told us all about local customs, food and drink - even offering round samples of poteen, the potent Irish moonshine. As far as access goes, it was a bit tight at the entrance/shop area, but I was easily able to get into everywhere else on the site on my small scooter. There were wheelchair-accessible loos in the village site and the snack bar across the car park that were both a bit tatty but big and clean, and a highlight of the visit was that my scooter coped OK with the path across the beautiful sand dunes near the museum.   "
1917,We recently returned home from our second holiday at 'Our Bench' Within 24 hours we had secured our next holiday there for later this year.  These bungalows are very homely and very well equipped. We had a fantastic time and are looking forward to many more visits in the future.
1918,"Getting into the building was via a level access large glass door. On entry the reception staff pointed out the lift and helped to hold the door whilst I wheeled in. The office I was visiting had wide doors, level access and plenty of space to manoeuvre around."
1919,"There was a very wide door, you go through the entryway where toilets are and there are chairs and benches, through into the bar area with you lots of seats, into the restaurant at the back. It was easy to get past the other tables. The whole area is carpet so a bit harder to self-propell. The tables are a good height. There are no steps. We had to go pay at the bar though which was very high and staff didn’t offer to help so I sent a friend up to pay for mine."
1920,"Wheelchair accessible restroom with level access, good size disabled toilet, friendly staff and good foodin the bar – what not to like. i agree fully with previous review."
1921,Staff are friendly
1922,Lovely cottage first class for us needing ceiling  hoist holidays everything spot on and proprietor Rob could not be more helpful we will definitely be adding this to our holiday/ breaks list
1923,It has a Changing Places loo which consist of a ceiling track hoist and adult size changing bench. So 5 stars for me! 
1924,Staff friendly and responsive to AAC (iPad communication) and also to the student with a learning disability.
1925,"Level access at entrance and throughout, usual difficulties navigating tables in the restaurant but not too bad."
1926,"Quiet peaceful location away from main roads yet within easy reach of all the local attractions, Beamish Museum especially. Metro Centre also close by. Good free parking and easy ramp access to hotel.  We as a group booked rooms 1,2, and 3 on the ground floor, all with immense double beds and excellent furnishings. Room 1 [ours] had a walk-in wet room /shower. Sliding patio doors from the room straight onto your parking space.  Outside the room there is seating in the hotel lobby  and tables available for guests in a conservatory-type area.  Flat access throughout, excellent restaurant, excellent staff.  Disabled toilets easily accessible in corridor outside the restaurant.  "
1927,"make it easy to get help if needed, very experienced at working with people with different needs"
1928,"Not a great place for wheelchair users, all tables are in self-contained bays with two benches."
1929,We went on the bus which stops not far from the venue.  The street that the restaurant is on is pedestrianised. 
1930,The Underbelly is a wheelchair accessible theatre with well organised support set within the equally accessible George Square Gardens. Only minor drawbacks a cobbled street to cross to get there and poorly designed doorway on the accessible loos.
1931,"The path that runs around the beaches is tarred and easy to negotiate. There a smooth tarred ramp down to that area of beach boardwalk.  Not all access points to the beach are like this, most are stepped."
1932,"Top marks, it’s a pleasure for them to work here, so they are going to make your visit as nice as possible."
1933,There is a disabled toilet downstairs but it isn't fully equipped with a hoist etc. and the door is quite heavy. It's also a bit small for big chairs.
1934,"Better Mobility was asked to undertake the Bermondsey Brewery Tour to assess for wheel chair access at four brewery sites.  Commencing at Bermondsey City Hall. the group headed off to Southwark Brewery. The first of four micro breweries on the leisurely walking tour. Prior to sampling the delicious beer, a fascinating talk from Pete aka ""Big Bear"" on the origins of beer kept all enthralled. Make the most of the disabled toilet facilities here, as our team found the next brewery, the Anspach & Hobday lacking in wheelchair accessible facilities - however, this is now being addressed by the tour organisers. They were not lacking in great beers though, and the team settled down to enjoy some fantastic Pale Ale. We've also fed back to the organisers that the tour guides should review the route slightly to accommodate dropped curbs for wheelchair users. Read the full article  at http://bit.ly/1sOpHGl."
1935,"Friendly staff, ready to engage and help"
1936,Excellent - very helpfull
1937,Parking was very easy with accessible parking bays on the harbour side. Further bays were just around the corner of the headland at Broughty Ferry Beach; a five minute walk away.
1938,Ramped access into wide open shop with hundreds of tinned sardines.
1939,The access is great until you get to platform 9 and 10 which have no access! A bit of nightmare as we have been changed to these platforms before with no warning! They had a back gate so that you could leave via the back entrance! Was a total nightmare though! We were getting picked up at the main entrance and were in the totally wrong place! I had gotten so flustered with it all I left my bag on the platform! Which I luckily got back. We were just abandoned at this back gate and had to figure out where to go from there! With luggage - not great!
1940,Fine with a blue badge as long as places are free outside which may not always be the case in busy periods. Plenty of multi story parking nearby.
1941,See my comments above about the assistant manager. I did not interact with any other staff.
1942,"I took a taxi to the venue, there were no issues dropping me off close bye. There are bus stops on both sides of the road servicing the southside and city centre. The subway is a couple of hundred yards away. On street parking is limited. "
1943,"We were very pleased with the excellent access available at the event centre. Our son Liam uses a wheelchair, we were able to access all areas at the event centre with ease. Excellent disabled changing facilities which ensures inclusion for all and means we can attend events as a family, which is not always easy. Highly recommended, look forward to the next event."
1944,"Staff were tremendous, very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed."
1945,"There are allocated spaces in the first car park you come to BUT don't use that, continue on bearing right and follow the road round past Whitby Brewery until you come to the turning circle at the end. Go through the archway to the left  (there is a sign indicating disabled parking spaces) and sure enough there are six spaces just inside on the right. These are FREE whereas you'll have to pay in the other car park."
1946,"The lower level is all on the flat, the toilet is of a good size. The space is good around the exhibit for a chair and the audio tour around the town is quite easy to menouvre. The staff are super helpful and are willing to take any research information from upstairs down to you if you want it. They seem to be quite focused on trying to be more accessible to all.   Would 100% recommend   Great for kids! "
1947,Outstanding disabled access inside and out.
1948,"Several bar staff asked if they could help at all, which was appreciated."
1949,A return visit as I enjoyed the experience last time.  I would of given a rating of 4.75.  The only problem is with a lip at the entrance which may make it difficult for electric wheelchairs.  Really enjoyed this visit.  Felt really safe as the staff were Covid compliant.  
1950,"The toilets were passable, however the venue had lost their radar key when we arrived, luckily I had mine. The disabled loo was difficult to get in and felt a bit like a dumping ground. "
1951,Flat entrance - no stairs - large door to enable Disabled Access.
1952,"There's a loo by the entrance at the top of the site, but I used the one in the museum at the bottom. This, when I eventually got into it, was large and clean with good rails, but the door was a bit too automated for its own good! A touch pad outside is supposed to show when the loo is occupied or free, and then you tap the pad to open the door. After waiting a very long time (taking into account that wheelchair users like myself tend to be slow in the loo) I began to suspect that the loo wasn't actually occupied and the electronic lock display was faulty. It turned out I was right, and it took some effort by two members of staff to get the loo open for me.  "
1953,"I've always been a fan of Pink Floyd, one of the wealthiest bands that ever existed but always had strong artistic integrity!  I found the exhibition to be very accessible, with a few small flaws but I would strongly recommend it, fan or not."
1954,"The Rumblin' Tum cafe in Ardrishaig is a lovely little cafe and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. It's right in the centre of Ardrishaig on the A83, amongst the shops and just before you reach the Crinan canal sea loch(onto Loch Fyne). The Rumblin' Tum is really accessible as the entrance is flat from the street. There's 2 car parks almost opposite the cafe with 3 disabled spaces in one of the car parks and also at least 1 disabled space in the other. The car park is free & you use your disabled badge in your car whilst using the disabled bays.  When we visited the tables nearest the counter were available but I would advise to phone up to book one of these tables if you are in a wheelchair cause I wouldn't have been able to easily get to any other tables (without asking other people to stand up and move their tables/chairs) due to the space. The staff are friendly and moved the chairs so that I could have a space for me & my wheelchair at the table.  The meals are very well priced especially for the area & portions are really big! First time we visited I ordered a sandwich & salad plus a side(bowl) of chips & curry sauce although I should have just got it as a small side! The second time I visited I ordered the chicken burger & chips. Plus I ordered a coffee & walnut cake to takeaway. Both times the food was delicious! And it was only about 10 minutes for the food to be served and it wasn't too quiet either. If you don't wish to eat in you can order to takeaway! There aren't any disabled toilets in the cafe but there are public toilets right next to the car park, almost opposite the cafe (opposite the McColl's shop); there is one disabled toilet accessed using a radar key(I bought mine from my local council). Hope this review helps.  "
1955,"Lift to all levels, Electric doors with low level push button"
1956,"Helpful staff, will open the room if not already unlocked on request. "
1957,Friendly and helpful.
1958,"The Town Hall Keeper, Dave is unfailingly helpful, he turns up at the end of an event to conduct us to the lift, and points out if there is a delay, and ensures refreshment staff at the bar are available. He is hospitable and patient and makes every visit to the Literature Festival a real pleasure because we know there won't be any issues with our visit. The Literature Festival welcomers are aso unfailingly helpful and are active in helping any disabled visitor to be comfortable. "
1959,"Accessible buses stop on Bishopthorpe Road opposite Southlands Methodist Church, a short distance from the Richardson Street Park entrance.  Disabled parking available at Rowntree Park car park and at Bishopthorpe Road car park, both roughly 300m from the cafe."
1960,Terrible they could not be pestered
1961,Helpful! Asked at information desk for transport advice and they were helpful and signposted best exit to use.
1962,Friendly staff and wheelchair accessible throughout. 
1963,"All the activities were flooded out by people who went in groups.  I went as a disabled singleton and could not get on ANY of the activities - every time I tried, the room was full of a group from somewhere and I just couldn't get a chance to do anything.  I spent most of my  time sitting in the cafeteria with a diet Coke! Had this problem last year too - PLEASE make these things more singleton friendly!  Bad day for me, seemed great for all the others.  2 stars for the cafeteria - it was clean (but overpriced!)"
1964,"The staff are fantastic! They are such a lovely bunch and will really go above and beyond to accommodate, unfortunately its just limited by the small size of the shop ad poor access to amenities."
1965,Secure parking facilities next to cottages.  Accessible buses close by.
1966,There is on street parking but because it's a residential area with lots of tenements it's fairly busy. Battlefield road which is well served by a number of different buses is a couple of hundred yards away. There is an entrance to Mount Florida train station on battlefield road but this is inaccessible for wheelchairs. There is an accessible entrance to the train station but that one is quite a distance.
1967,Very friendly and communicated well.
1968,Can't praise my assistant enough!
1969,Large accessible toilet near to the entrance.
1970,"For Disney it's not about disabled access, it's just access, what more could we want"
1971,Ample parking near visitor centre and designated bays for Blue Badge holders.
1972,"The famous West Sands run alongside the Old Course and there is an excellent path, mostly tarmac, that runs around the course and even down to the Eden estuary. We found that the part of the path which runs in front of the Old Course Hotel out towards the estuary allows an excellent wheelchair or electric scooter outing. There is a toilet block ( not strictly disabled access ) about 500 metres along this path. The views are amazing. "
1973,Clean toilets but access is to the toilets means going through two heavy push doors and isn't well thought out. I struggled in my wheelchair and someone with sticks would too.
1974,"Now that the disabled parking bays have been re-painted, parking is very easy for Blue Badge holders."
1975,They were very easy to find and clean.
1976,2 disabled spaces but a small car park and other patrons park willy nilly! So have been blocked from getting out of my chair into the car.
1977,Toilets are good well sited good size well laid out
1978,Very good and clean.
1979,"Automatic doors as you arrive, lifts up to the terminals and staff friendly at the assisted travel. We were meet promptly at the gate to board the flight and on the return journey we were greeted in good time when we landed. We were fast tracked through check in and boarder control which was great!"
1980,"The venue is very easy to find its on London Road just at Bridgeton, It has a ramp and automatic doors "
1981,Great toilets that can be used by wheelchair users if they could actually get into the restaurant and through the tables
1982,"Large carpark with designated disabled spaces near the front door. Inside and outside seating areas . All inside are wheelchair accessible. Outside is in 2 areas - one up a step. Staff are very good at finding a suitable table. Table service. Large shop with butchers, kitchenware and gifts. Good variety of gins on sale! "
1983,"As with any medieval building, city or environment you can only do so much to achieve complete accessibility. The modifications that the City of York has and Minster are excellent, but of course being profoundly VI I can only explain how positive, friendly people were in offering support, even though I aspire to be as independent as possible. In shops I really like that when people spotted the Cane, they asked if they could be of assistance, gave great explanation and contactless payment provision was universal."
1984,"It is recommended you book a time-slot in advance to climb the o2 (dome times you can also find discounts online, or combination tickets with other attractions). If walking over the o2, you require to be able to walk unaided, without a walking aid, and be relatively fit. (I am relatively fit, and still thought it was a fairly steep climb, though you can rest as you need to). It is also at a height, and you are exposed to whatever the weather conditions are on the day. You can't really carry personal belongings, phones or small cameras must be carried in a pocket which can zip. Small medication eg inhalers, can be carried, you're advised to let the climb guide know if you need anything like this.  Glasses and hearing aids which are worn securely are allowed (check they are secure!!) There are lockers where you can leave your belongings. I would also say you need to be able to follow instructions - you are attached by climbing rope at all times while climbing, but you are responsible for threading this along the route. You go up with a group of people, there are Guides, who were great, and they really kept an eye that everyone was OK.  But, they also do wheelchair climbs! I didn't see this happening. They have a special wheelchair for the climb, their staff are not allowed to help you transfer into this, but they have a hoist so if you/your carers can use this. You need to bring your own sling. They also have a large changing room with changing plinth.  You can book for one person doing wheelchair climb but up to 9 friends/family can also book to walk at the same time (1 carer place is  included in that number, the carer is free).  The person in the wheelchair will be taken on the climb with four 02 guides, who use a pulley system. See this for more info: https://www.theo2.co.uk/accessibility/up-at-the-o2-2"
1985,The staff were very helpful and approachable. They made the visit very enjoyable by being very friendly and always thinking of other alternatives if an issue arose. 
1986,"Excellent level access to and throughout spacious property. Large wetroom with Clos-o-mat washer/dryer toilet, adjustable height basin, grab rails, shower seat. Adjustable height kitchen work top with sink and hob. Adjustable height dressing table. Level access patio and car park area. Owners have various extra aids to assist you - bed grab rail, elephant feet to raise armchair or bed, long shoe horn."
1987,There is a large carpark as Hollywood Bowl is located at Glasgow Springfield Quay so there are also restaurants. We managed to park directly outside the entrance.
1988,"In front of main library building is a piazza (open square). There are both a small flight of stairs and step free entrances to the piazza. If it's been raining, as I walk with a crutch, I tend to find the surface of the piazza very slippery as it has smooth tiled and marble flooring. I find it easier to enter either from Euston Road from the right hand side as there is a covered walkway to the main entrance or from Midland Road, opposite St Pancras Station as with both routes I don't have to manage the slippery tiles. Then there is a ramp or small flight of stairs to enter the building. Once inside the entrance you are immediately faced with a flight of stairs, however on the right towards the rear there is a lift that connects with the lower group and upper ground floor. From there are other floors there are lifts that stop at every floor except the entrance hall level. The entrance lift was easy to find but it had to be pointed out to me the first time I need to use it. If you are unsure there is an information desk opposite the entrance.  The Conference Centre, is a separate building, and from the piazza there is a steps free entrance an lift to the upper floor. The doors are power assisted for easy opening."
1989,"Cheerful, commiciated well with me and explained some of the deals. "
1990,Co-operative and helpful
1991,"Most of (but not all) the staff including the owner are really lovely, friendly and helpful. Some staff have been super accomodating and knowledgeable about allergies, some also remember what I have when I go in! "
1992,"The main entrance to reception has a double door which can be opened up. There is a slight sill to get over but wasn't a problem.  Reception is accessible. We couldn't access the main restaurant which was down a few stairs, but most people were having lunch in the bar, the adjacent conservatory or the terrace outside. Bar and conservatory were accessible with just a slight sill. Terrace wasn't. Wonderful views over the garden from the conservatory."
1993,very friendly and helpful.
1994,Staff have always been helpful and accommodating when visiting this venue. 
1995,"Wheelchair accessible, very helpful friendly staff, I emailed before hand and the staff gave me lots of useful information. There are two entrances, one with steps, one without, I was directed to the non step entrance"
1996,"Good wheelchair access, very sweet staff - recommended if you need drinks and snacks near Tower Hill"
1997,"There are two entrances, both are easily accessible for wheelchairs and other mobility aids from the street. There are two levels inside - one is slightly raised but steps and a ramp allow ease of access to this dining area. There is plenty of space between tables and around them meaning it is very easy to navigate"
1998,"Lovely staff, adorably friendly and helpful. Utterly reliable - the same high quality of service on every visit (I've been there loads of times)."
1999,We parked in a disabled space close to the Roman Baths
2000,"This is a very large 24 hour Tesco inside Falkirk's central retail park. Access overall is good, and the supermarket is close to public transport and plenty of accessible parking spaces."
2001,4 miles south of Farnham Alice Holt Forest offers plenty of woodland walks on good paths suitable for wheelchairs. With a café and picnic area. 
2002,There is quite a few disabled parking spaces
2003,"Wheelchair access into Tower Bridge exhibition was excellent. There was a member of staff standing outside who directed us to the disabled access, this was an electric door operated by the staff. It was literally next to the other entrance. I found them to be very friendly & helpful. Even though we visited on a Saturday we didn't have to queue we went straight through. It didn't appear to be very busy at the time we visited (13.00)."
2004,"The toilets are located at the entrance to Monikie Country Park and directly infront of the accessible parking spaces. The male and female toilets are accessed by a step however, there is an accessible toilet that has level access between the male and female toilets. The accessible toilet is very small though and I can imagine it would be quite difficult for a wheelchair user to use, especially if they require assistance from someone else.  Like all toilets is a public park, they weren’t very clean. I mean I felt it was cleaner than others that I have visited. You can see the size of the accessible toilet in an image below showing my wheelchair in it."
2005,"Bus stops, with accessible buses, are nearby so it's only a short walk away. Parking on the other hand is a bit of non-starter in this part of town."
2006,"Friendly, very knoweldgable. Have clearly worked with a range of different disabilities. Very welcoming"
2007,Toilets are usually clean unless your unlucky enough to be in one directly after someone with poor hygiene... happened to us a few times 
2008,"Eataly is the world's biggest Italian food store. The access is good throughout, and there are lots of restaurants to take a rest and enjoy a meal."
2009,"I used the normal accessible toilet. It was okay and clean but the gateway in was too narrow for my trike, so I left it outside and walked in. A normal manual chair should be fine though. I didn't see the changing places but I believe there is one. Campsite toilets are in the golf club. These were closed (to campers) due to covid but looked okay. The path to the golf club was smooth and easy... once you get off the field. We mostly used our own facilities though."
2010,Car park over road and outside restaurant.  Buses stop about 3 Minutes walk
2011,Ramped access from car park.  Car park is gravelled.
2012,"Everything on the flat, staff go over and above to help. Cafe accessible, fully accessible toilets. Ambulift available  to access flight"
2013,"Getting in the building requires passing through two glass doors. An intercom alterts people to your presence and the reception team will ""buzz you in"". They were happy enough to help with the doors as they are a bit heavy for a manual wheelchair user. Once inside there are a couple of heavy doors to negotiate and then you have access to a spacious lift to go upstairs or you simply wheel along the corridor if visiting ground floor offices."
2014,"No help whatsoever, even the manager, who did not apologise and said ""*maybe* were wrong not to mention there's a small step"", completely downplaying how much of an accessfail a step is."
2015,There are Blue Badge spaces right outside the front door. Be aware it gets busy though! We went on a Sunday around lunchtime and the place was packed & were lucky to get a space.
2016,1 was very nice and helped however he could.  The other kept insisting we were disabled and should be sat in our wheelchairs as only paid for 1 seat 
2017,Rough carpark. No disabled spaces but plenty of room when we went. Cafe is in a tin shed but dont let this put you off. Very rustic inside but fabulous cakes! Fresh home baking. The scone is huge and they cut you a slice off it - one slice easily did 2 people. Really quirky decor. Children's play area. Really good disabled toilet. Will definitely be back 
2018,"Both RADAR and regular accessible toilets are available on the lower floor. On the dining terrace, there are both accessible toilets and Changing Places facilities. The RADAR toilets are always very clean and tidy, with plenty of space for a wheelchair or other large aid and a carer. There are grab rails, including a fold-down rail by the side of the toilet"
2019,"Beyond the Deepening Shadow: The Tower Remembers marks the centenary of the end of the First World War. Each evening, between 5pm and 9pm, the moat of the Tower of London is illuminated with thousands of individual flames in an act of rememberance. The Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) light the first flame and then a team of volunteers light the rest of the flames, During the ceremony music is played, a new choral work, with words from War Poet Mary Borden’s Sonnets to a Soldier. The display ends at 9pm each evening.  There are 2 ways to view the event. Firstly there are tickets which provide access to the moat. These tickets are now sold out. There are excelllent access arrangements for people doing this and deserve 5 stars.  There is also free public viewing from Tower Hill and the Tower concourse, this is what I did on the Monday evening, and this is what I will comment about in my review. There appears to be no special arrangments for disabled people viewing from the free viewing points, as all people have to join the same queue.  UPDATE 08/11/2019:  I contacted the Tower of London to ask if they could improve the accessibility for people in the free viewing areas by allowing those who need it not to queue up. I would suggest asking a steward about accessibility if you are unable to stand in the queue. The next day they replied saying "" Thank you for your kind words and for providing us with such detailed feedback of your experience at the Tower Remembers. I have forwarded your message on to the event organiser so they can review this process for the remaining nights and future events. "" I hope this helps people who are visiting later this week.  UPDATE 13/11/2018:  Following on from contacting the Tower of London I received a 2nd email on 12/11/2018. This one was from their visitors' centre. Their reply was ""We learnt much from the incredible public response to it, which included huge numbers of people coming to Tower Hill to see it.  I am very sorry that you did not find the access area until later in your visit after you had queued. Stewards at the entrance to the queue barrier should have been looking for and telling people about the area.  We had some stewards specifically dedicated to doing this but the sheer volume meant that we missed you.  I can only apologise for this. I will certainly be feeding your experience into the review process for the project."" I've been very pleased with the Tower of London's response to my comments as a disabled visitor."
2020,Staff were particularly helpful from the ticket team who explained the accessibility through to the stewards around the vessel.
2021,"Ground floor venue with no steps, clear signage in large print, disabled toilets and staff who are open to everyone and find different ways of communicating and supporting people based on their requirements."
2022,"The entrance to Queen’s Court is a series of two manual doors, one after the other. However, they are both lightweight and spaced wide enough apart to make getting through in a wheelchair easy, and the first may even be propped open depending on the weather. Most of the tables are at a good height to access from a wheelchair, and chairs can be moved around to accommodate people. The ramps between the different tiers (Queen’s Court is on a hill) are wide enough, but in places can be very steep. All areas are accessible, including the bar and courtyard. "
2023,There were multiple disabled parking bays spread over the campus.
2024,"Level access through nice wide doors, albeit two sets. Might have been tricky for my companion but keen - eyed staff were quick to open both doors as we approached. Plenty of room inside to manoeuvre wheelchair ( though see comments on WC below). Staff offered to remove chair at table for me, though I opted to transfer. Plenty of space to stash wheelchair. Nice smooth floor."
2025,There is a good number of accessible toilets and they are a good size so very easy to manoeuvre.
2026,"There was a broad ramp down to pitch level but no  signage and disabled seating was tacked on, in front of the stand like an afterthought."
2027, The staff were friendly and helpful .
2028,There is on street parking and you can usually get a space if you're a Blue a Badge holder. It does become more difficult during Festival time. It's adjacent to the Market Street entrance to Waverley Station.
2029,"well sign-posted, full accessible, grab rails, plenty of  space, very clean and well maintained"
2030,"There was one accessible toilet before the actual arena (in the area we were in) and so at times this was being used by lots of people who didn't need to because it was a long queue for the ladies!!  The one accessible loo was only just big enough to fit me my chair and carer in, was also (as often the case) the only baby change and the nappy/incontinence/sanitary bin was overflowing hours before the concert even started.  There was no one managing the toilets to allow disabled people to have priority and thought that it was quite appalling that (although I don't need it) there was no changing places so anyone needing this sort of facility would have been forced to use the floor which would only have been big enough for a smaller person and although there were grab rails and an emergency cord there was no hoist or anything like that.  I didn't use the toilets within the arena itself (once past security for the event) and so didn't notice what was available there, but judging from the other facilities I can't see it having been any different."
2031,"This city can be accessed by train and by transit buses.  There are also taxi companies who can accommodate all needs.  There are also various accessible parking options within the city.  On Market days, it can get a bit crowded, so be sure to arrive before 10.  The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can assist with transportation and lodging arrangements."
2032,"All level access into and within the tennis area.  Automatic doors at the front entrance.  The food court was in a nearby building and had gentle ramped entrance though heavy doors to get inside. Seating for wheelchair users wasn't specifically designated - I could park up anywhere along the front row  as the seats flipped up out of the way. As it wasn't busy, this was great - I don't know how it would work if it was busy.  All worked fine on the day we were there though."
2033,"Kruger National Park is a self drive safari park in South Africa. We were able to visit the park at our own pace and when we stopped at the main camps we found them to be surprisingly accessible with dedicated parking places, step free access and to have accessible loos. It was amazing to see lions, elephants, giraffes, zebras and many many more in their natural habitat. A top tip would be to get the proper map from one of the shops at the entrance to the park - this not only shows the location of the camps but has distance and time estimates between them and it has a guide to the wildlife so that you can identify what animals and birds you are seeing. There are a couple of tarmac roads which are the main routes in the park but there are dirt tracks off to the side of these and these are well worth taking a 'bumpy' detour down!  We were entering and exiting from the southern gates of the park each day - Crocodile Bridge Gate and Malalane Gate - so this review concentrates on this area and the Lower Sabie and Satara Camp. It's a huge area so we didn't get to explore the whole of the park!"
2034,"Staff were helpful, welcoming and had good disability awareness. When I arrived they immediately noticed that I had a crutch and quickly put it through the scanner and returned it to me before I proceeded through security. Likewise they accompanied us in the lift. "
2035,Staff at all the places I visited were exceptionally helpful.
2036,I won't go into a lot of detail - it's a toilet.   I worry a lot about going to places in case the disabled toilets are awful. Luckily this one wasn’t. It had the grab rails you would expect and it is quite spacious.
2037,"Excellent access. Nice and warm in the winter, cool in the summer. Great coffee and grub too!"
2038,"lovely little coffee shop with a nice selection of coffee and cakes. the disabled parking is near the entrance to the shop, once you get to the door, it is a 'pull' door so there is a little sticker that says if any wheelchair user needs help please press the buzzer and someone will come out to help you, which I thought was quite nice :) you need to walk through the shop to get to the coffee shop, and then there is a very steep slope right before you enter the coffee, so if you're in a manual wheelchair, you'll need to keep your hands on the breaks while going downhill or you may take off!! Overall, it is a nice little coffee shop and I will be going back!"
2039,"from the car, ramp and steps up to front door ,door had level entrance and was wide"
2040,"Brickhouse Farm Cottages is an amazing place with 12 lovely accessible cottages surrounding a beautiful little lake within the tranquility of rural Lancashire. The cottages were purpose built in 2013 to welcome people with accessibility needs together with their families, friends and carers. The 12 cottages, which are different sizes, are set up with level access as well as having many other aids including ceiling track hoists. I visited with my brother in law who is a powerchair user and it was a very good experience for him and us.   The people we met at the Brickhouse Farm Cottages were incredibly friendly and they are constantly looking for feedback to make the place as good as it can be for guests. They are building a new welcome centre complete with an accessible hydrotherapy pool and I am sure that we are looking forward to returning in the future.  "
2041,There is step free access to the premises. With the coffee shop being so big it is easy moving around inside. There are seats on the pavement outside and also ramped access to a seating area at the back.
2042,"The toilets can be hard to access as even though it clearly says ""disabled toilets"" on the door, everyone else uses the toilet. I needed the toilet but there was a LONG queue of about 20 people and not one of them was physically disabled and it took me 20 minutes to get to the front of the queue.  "
2043,"It is a level surface from the pedestrian area outside to the table. The front door was closed with no obvious bell or sign to summon assistance but, on both visits, a member of staff saw me from reception and opened the door for me."
2044,The front entrance door opens into a very small vestibule. The inner door also opens into the vestibule so it is difficult with a large wheelchair - but possible - the ledges are small. They will rush to help and they keep a door wedge on the mantlepiece.
2045,"The entrance is flat, the tills when I visited had a decent queue set up with good space to manoeuvre to, and there is a lift to the screens and galleries on the upper floor. There are disabled toilet too.  There are boards and staff to inform you where you need to go, but I've not got much experience with them. According to the website, headphones for audio description are available on request. "
2046, The disabled toilet is located on the fourth floor . It can be easily accessed by a wheelchair user by going in the lift. I have never been in such a luxurious  disabled toilet .  There is plenty of space . Instead of paper towels there proper hand towels. There is a  phone and emergency button at floor level if any  assistance is required .  An added bonus was that the decor was lovely .
2047,Very helpful.
2048,"Off road private parking next to cottage. Tarmac surface. Access to cottage and parking up a steep slope, we found it easier to turn at the next lay by and access from other side. Similarly for leaving it was easier to turn car to face gates to exit, rather than trying to reverse through them"
2049,There was an accessible toilet and it was big a spacious. I am not a expert of disabled toilets but I am pretty sure that the red cable was tangled. 
2050,This hotel was not very well thought of for a wheelchair. Yes they did have ramps and very small lifts. Getting to the main reception is over a gravel path (not good for a wheelchair). Getting to the accessible room. You need to go back out and down the gravel path to cross a road to get to another part of the building to get the lift to the room. Once in there the room furniture is very dated and damaged. Plenty of turning space in room. Lamp switch is a step on button. Behind a chair... bathroom ok apart from not being able to use the shower as this was in a bath. We asked for an executive room. This was far from executive. I would get a better room with a premier Inn.  To get to the restaurant was fine. Along the first floor. A set of 5 steps with a lift. Through the corridor another 5 steps with lift. Food was lovely and staff attentive and polite. 
2051,Access is excellent all doors to the outside are automatic and there are no doors into the shops or restaurants 
2052,"Great. Right at the entrance, clearly signed and with a red cord hanging correctly."
2053,The café is on the pedestrianised walk way adjacent to the beach front. There are buses that stop near by.
2054,Helpful but busy
2055,A brilliant place to visit in a wheelchair - almost everything is just right
2056,This was fine I use a car and parked in the carpark in the front for free
2057,"Enjoyed immensely, has everything required for disabled access. Comfortable medical bed, hoist, wheelchair friendly wet room and WC or commode as required. Plenty of room to move around cabin with a nice rise and recline armchair. They have off road wheelchairs which enabled me to access the countryside as I never thought I would, it managed inclines and paths my wheelchair could not. David and Felicity were really helpful, especially as our car broke down, they went above and beyond, even making us a slide board so that we could access our brothers vehicle to head home whilst our car had to be towed."
2058,"All the staff we met, and shopkeepers, are very friendly and helpful, and supported us through our visit. "
2059,M&S and Starbucks were easily accessible. Starbucks has lots of clear circulation space in coffee shop and tables/chairs of different sizes and types 
2060,Once you got past the main door and in to the store there are signs up indicating what is available in each  area. However as you go round the store you come across items being displayed at the end of an aisle this making less space available. There was even items behind the check out area again making the passageway narrower. There is one checkout marked for wheelchair and prams but while it is a good width again there were item being displayed behind the checkout on your way out. The exit door is also automatic and you are back to the obstacles you pass to go in 
2061,"Bouncers Shaun or John open door for you and when inside, all on the flat."
2062,Helpful when making choices. Brought food and hot drinks to the table. 
2063,"We attempted to visit House of Dun today , one of our party in a powered wheelchair. We were not expecting to be able to get into the house. We did hope to get into the garden, which the online guide says is wheelchair friendly. It may possibly be. But the access to the garden is over large  loose stone chippings, so we couldn't get through the gateway to find out.   Rollator also couldn't cope. Blue badge parking was by the entrance. Cafe and shop and courtyard were accessible. Outer  edge of courtyard has flagstoned path. However, this is partly obscured by tied open barn doors,  and as we negotiated around the doors we we got the wheelchair stuck in the loose chippings.   Disappointed, but at least we hadn't travelled far from our holiday accommodation.  "
2064,the university has a small car park - car parking facilities across the road
2065,Manual doors for entry but seemed light 
2066,Lots of space.
2067,"Disabled parking is limited. The bays available are just basic bays, they do not have marked out sections. The bay is just slightly wider, says disabled and in white paint. "
2068,"There was some parking but it was a good distance from the places where I wanted to go to. So I traveled by public transport , but the nearest place I was to George Square was about half a mile away. "
2069,Very friendly and keen to help.
2070,"Getting to Fort George was fairly straightforward as we arrived by WAV (wheelchair accessible vehicle) and pulled up in the gravel surfaced car park near to the entrance path. There are a few accessible parking bays by the start of the entrance path but these aren’t obvious as they have quite small signs. The other point of note is that the bays aren’t marked out with lines are clear demarcation so beware of vehicles parking too close to you if you need wheelchair access to the doors of your vehicle.  I think it fair to warn people that Fort George is a place that does involve being able to walk or wheel some significant distances albeit with places to stop, rest a while and take in the view.  The options for public transport appeared limited as the Fort is set out on a peninsula jutting out in to the sea. "
2071,Great access both into Dobbies and out the back.
2072,"Hoe Grange has car parking right next to each cabin with ramps direct into the cabins, all very easy. "
2073,"Everyone I encountered was very welcoming and accommodating (if you have read my other reviews you will see I am trying to improve on ""friendly and helpful"". "
2074,2 disabled parking bays right at the door
2075,Clean and spacious accessible loo. The door opened inwards which would normally have been an issue but because of its size and layout it was fine. The fixtures and fittings kept with the rest of the decor and were shiny chrome. Full length mirror too. One thing that could have been improved was that the Red Cord seemed to have been cut off half way up so if she'd had a fall my pal wouldn't have been to call for help.
2076,There is level access and the door to the cottage is extra wide to accommodate wheelchairs with an exterior light for nighttime and a ramp.
2077,On a side Street ad close as I could get to Princes Street. It took 20 minutes of driving to find it and it was too far for me to manage the walk.
2078,"Walked from Vauxhall Station, about a 15 minute direct walk over the bridge."
2079,"It is a little difficult to get parked close to the restaurant as it is on the Royal Mile, but I managed to get parked on Johnston Terrace. There are 2 disabled bays here, which are very handy."
2080,The staff we were in contact with very helpful and friendly
2081,"The building is a huge improvement on the main Euston Road hospital building. There is level access from the pavement, without the need for any ramps or steps.   I entered by the Grafton Way and Huntley Street corner entrance. There is a revolving door which has stickers on it with symbols of a wheelchair user, persona with a mobility aid and a pram all with red crosses through them. While I see that they have done this pictorially so everyone can tell, as a disabled person, having the image that represents me crossed out feels a very negative way to tell me not to use the door. The accessible door which says it's automatic, has a sticker of a wheelchair user, two people, on with a walking stick, a parcel and a pram.  Then there is a small foyer which has a member of staff to assist and hand sanitisers . Then there is an automatic door into the main reception area.  Information desks are lower and there is a choice of chairs or sofa seating. Patients stay here until they are called through for their appointment.   I exited on the Grafton Road entrance, and I noticed that there is a small café area (sorry no photos as there were people sitting there). The Grafton Road entrance is also at ground level with no ramps. In front of this entrance is a large very spacious covered area which is very handy. There is the same arrangements with doors as I mentioned for the other entrance.  It's a really nice and accessible building."
2082,There is a ramp up to the entrance. Entrance doors are wide but then there is a secondary barrier to get through which is automatic
2083,"Situated in the medieval historic core of the town's grid system, parking is limited, biut there are disabled parking spaces nearby and a long parking bay in the street. A littel further away there is parking in the town's market square (except on Wednesdays and Saturdays which are market days), parking bays on Angel Hill and a littel further away, the arc shopping centre car park. The town is accessible by bus and train, although the train station is a distance away from the venue."
2084,"The Square is a wide open space with statues, fountains, Nelson's Column, a cafe and toilets. It is easy to access from the Southern side where there is level access. Steps on the North side lead up to the National Gallery."
2085,This is a family run beauty therapist in Shetland. It has level access throughout and is attached to a lovely farm shop and cafe.
2086,quite roomy with grab rails
2087,No easy parking in the immediate vicinity. Accessible buses pass along the street.
2088,"From the bus stop cross over the zebra crossing and it is a 5 minute sign posted walk to the villa's entrance. The route slopes upwards. While I was walking up a man appeared in a golf buggy and offered to drive me up to the villa's entrance. He told me when I was ready to depart to make my way to the shop and ask them to call him and he would take me back down, which he did.  The villa is in the process of some renovations at the moment, so my review is how I found it in February 2020.  From the gift shop entrance there is another slope and then a small flight of stairs without handrail and a ramp to the villa. There is a manual door to enter the villa. This leads to an internal courtyard where there is a information desk, at standing height, to show your tickets and to collect the audio guide which is included in the admission price. The ground floor, cafe and toilets are on the ground floor and all are step free. There is nowhere to sit and rest apart from a few  benches in the central courtyard, some of these are very low but there are higher ones against the walls.    Upstairs is only accessible by stairs. There are 2 sets of stairs. Both only have a hand rail on the one side. One staircase is reasonably wide and the other is a spiral staircase, see photos. I think you were meant to go up the wider staircase and desend by the spiral staircase. However, I used the wider staircase both ascending and descending. Upstairs there is a small cinema, leading off the wider staircase. It's hear the top of the staircase and there is a single step into it. It has free standing chairs with back support. The film is in French with English subtitles. There are not as many grand rooms to see upstairs as some rooms have collections of china. The best thing about upstairs is the verandah which overlooks the gardens. Here there there is some seating.  The cafe is on the ground floor with step free access. It has free standing tables and chairs.   There is a door out to the French Garden. This is the largest garden with fountains and classical music show every 20 minutes. There are some steps or a ramp to access this part of the gardens. Off the main gardens are several smaller gardens which are only accessible by steps. Some of these steps have no handrail and are also warn down and uneven. I only explored a couple of the other gardens as I found access rather difficult."
2089,"Very easy to access bar and dining room on ground floor, with disabled toilet."
2090,"Disabled bays are quite close to entrance, which has a level approach, with a pull handled door, and all areas inside and throughout the hotel are on the level, with a lift provided. We saw all the hotel as needed, and plenty of seating areas for you."
2091,No steps. A few doorways. Easy to get round in chair once inside.
2092,We can always get one of the accessible parking spots right out side the door. However on rainy days puddles do appear that you have to climb over in order the keep your feet dry.
2093,Superb signposting throughout (inc maps). Open plan layout means no pesky doors to negotiate (except the front automatic ones) If entering by ASDA there is a lift to the main shopping floor but otherwise all is level access.
2094,City centre restaurant but on-street parking nearby.
2095,Parking available directly outside. 
2096,If u travel by car there are several disabled parking spaces just outside. If you are traveling by train you will need to cross over a bridge but there is lift access if you can't use the stairs then just a 5 minute walk from bridge to cinema. If you are traveling by bus the closest stop is right across from the cinema with low kurbs
2097,"When my train arrived in the morning my train had to wait 10 minutes as the fire alarm went off and the station was being evacuated. So when my train arrived I expected nobody to be there to meet me but I was wrong! Scotrail have never let me down when it comes to the staff! They helped me off the train and I was trying to get to the disabled parking bays quickly as I was meeting someone (I'll leave you to come to your own conclusions), and I got lost again but credit to the scotrail staff as there are always staff there who want to help you have the best start to your day. So a member of staff walked with me to the entrance door. The only criticism would be that there are not many drop down kerbs in the car park.   On my way back, I missed my train but I spoke to the staff who gave me options in order to get home. I ended up with a bleeding nose so one of the kind staff members got me a tissue, a glass of water and he also took me to the platform to wait for my train. I would say that the signs which tell you what platform you are at was too high and unless you want to strain your neck then it just better to guess. This could be solved by taking the signs down and putting them on the wall, at eye level for people in mobility scooters/wheelchairs.  "
2098,Once you manage to get in the building through the fire door the toilets were good! Located to the right inside the conservatory. The doors were easy to open and the area was very clean. Cannot fault them at all. 
2099,There was an accessible toilet which included a baby changing table. It was spacious enough to manoeuvre or for a carer to be in there and there was hand rails. Could have been slightly cleaner was the only criticism.
2100,To get between floors they have installed a stair lift which they have creatively lit up - really thoughtful touch. See photo.
2101,"Very friendly and a brilliant team of play staff, always happy, cheerful and helpful"
2102,Extremely professional and caring staff
2103,Staff and volunteers are on hand. All wearing clearly marked t shirts. I saw them preparing the areas each morning. All seemed friendly and welcoming.
2104,"We drove, street parking and private car park across the road available. The surface in the car park is a bit uneven."
2105,The park is quite flat and it is easy to get around.
2106,The access is generally very good. You will need to go to the Special Assistance Reception after you check in.
2107,Generally easy to get around as a wheelchair user. Are accessible loos on each floor (although the one on the top floor is quite tight. The cafe is fantastic.
2108,I came via bus but do know there are blue badge spaces next to the cafe area of the park.
2109,If you find one it should be adequate but basic. Most I have visited have had good circulation and side transfer space. Rails either side of loo but they don't do red cords. If you can travel over rough cobbles there is the loo with the best view in Europe by the castle by the sea. 
2110,Arrived by train..took us around 15 to 20 minutes walk taking our time myself in my powerchair and partner walking.
2111,Large carpark as part of the Silverburn shopping centre so there are lots of disabled bays.
2112,"The main entrance, at the corner of the pub, is step-free and most wheelchairs and powerchairs will fit through just one of the double doors at that entrance. The whole pub is gigantic and very spacious for manoeuvring."
2113,"Friendly and helpful, easily available when needed."
2114,"There is a level access door but this is usually locked so bring a friend. The food was delicious and this warm, dog friendly pub has a good atmosphere and lovely staff.  I did not explore whether there is an accessible toilet on my visit so please take this into account."
2115,excellent for wheelchair users
2116,"There is parking immediately in front of the store. Although there are a few spaces, the surface is gravel which can be a little tricky to negotiate. There are no designated accessible bays."
2117,Very friendly and helpful.
2118,No signage. At first sight it looks unaccessible but there is a slope at the side and access round the back. 
2119,"The accessible loo had everything I needed for my visit, and was extremely clean. It would be a little tight for wheelchair users who need a little more room for manoeuvre, but it was fine for me. "
2120,Good bus links right along the Dunbar high street and lots of parking in the vicinity. Good pedestrian crossings on approach to the bakery too.
2121,Probably this position was false given the sales but the store was very busy and the car park more congested than usual. Other than that excellent. Our entrance and exit xitwas near the McDonalds at Loanhead Junction.
2122,"We spoke a fair amount with Ruth King, she was always happy to answer questions before the visit, and was very helpful afterwards as despite a last sweep of the house we managed to leave a fair amount of stuff!"
2123,"Near to the university entrance round a sharp corner. Accessed via swipe card or security card. If you don't have these right away and can, ask the Helpdesk and they have access. Room inside for a wheelchair user and assistant. The door locks by a touchpad mechanism and beeps when it is locked. There is handrails and a red cord on the left hand side. Space under the sink to roll under and mirror above sink."
2124,Fantastic day out. All sloped.
2125,The venue is located about a 10 minute walk from Union Square where there is lots of parking available (about 12-14 minutes from the train station too). There is also some on street parking near the venue although I didn't see any specific accessible parking spots. The road is quite dark at night so will be easier to navigate in day light. 
2126,"From the booking & admin team, reception staff, carers, nurses, physiotherapists, drivers, cooks, therapists beauticians and the volunteers - nothing is too much trouble to make your stay more enjoyable."
2127,"I think a person of limited mobility would struggle to walk round here on foot, and as their website says they have no wheelchairs or mobility scooters for hire.  The car park is not too far away from the entrance but not as close as the web site had me believe."
2128,"I got the train into the station then left on foot to travel around Dundee. Great service from Glasgow Queen Street. I didn't see any accessible bays outside the station, but there is a taxi rank immediately outside the door. "
2129,"If you go to the Liquid Force Kite cafe on Rhyl front the owner will be able to help, he will ring the life guards to get the key and there are accessible beach wheelchairs in the red and brick lock up shed.  They are excellent so easy to use on the beach and go in the sea. There is a purpose built ramp to use on them down to the beach. They are brilliant no one seems to know they are there, but they are, don't let them tell you otherwise. Simon the owner of the cafe will help if you're stuck and he does amazing ice-cream and coffees. Well worth a trip to this beach just to be able to get on it. Only down side seems to be we couldn't find any changing places in North Wales."
2130,Lots of blue badge spaces by entrance. 
2131,The staff were all very helpful. We went to an exhibition they had on and a staff member had parked their car overhanging the path so we had to go round on the gravel. We mentioned this in passing and someone hurried off to get the person to move it forward.
2132,"There is limited disabled parking, but the staff will reserve you a space if you ask"
2133,"Very clean and spacious.  hand rails, shower chair on wheels.  Wet room so plenty of room for carer to be in there for showering."
2134,This really is the smallest accessible toilet I have ever seen. The rear of your wheelchair touched the door and the front touched the toilet so there was absolutelyto manoeuvre and you need is somebody to help pull your wheelchair away so you could get on the toilet. 
2135,Useless access for disabled visitors
2136,We didn't use the car park but did use the transport to the hotel which was first class. The return trip to the airport they didn't send a wheelchair accessible van so we had an hour wait. When we did get the van it was first class.
2137,Not perhaps the most accessible of places and spaces as you do have a countryside trek to make. The Boath is a 17th-century doocot on the site of an ancient castle site. The Doocot is  located close to the site where Montrose defeated the Covenanters on 9 May 1645.
2138,"There are lifts, toilets  and designated seating areas in all stands The course is neither big nor small so I can get around perfectly fine. Signage may be a little lacking but staff are always visible and on hand if anybody needs assistance.You can always hover in one place if need be - all the essentials are close by!"
2139,Doors are automatic. Level access. Counter wasn't lowered. Aisles are wide enough to turn around. 
2140,Staff are wonderful 
2141,"Nearest tube station is Marble Arch or Bond Street (which is due to become step free). There are numerous buses that go along Oxford Street and Edgware Road, and are 2 - 3 minutes walk from the restaurant. The restaurant is on a side street between Selfridges and March Arch."
2142,Friendly and helpful.
2143,"Botanical gardens including orchids, cafe and pond. Among former visitors to the gardens is Agatha Christie."
2144,"Throughout the village there is amply space for you to get around, even though it can be really full at times. There are no steps, it’s all flat and easy to get around, and we certainly saw everything. Plenty of seating areas for tired legs and heavy bags."
2145,The parking is at the back of the hotel but you can park at the front as well
2146,"You can pick up the Tramper in the main car park. However, if you can walk a little and don't need the Tramper, you can park further into the reserve in the Blue Badge Car Park and start from there."
2147,There is a toilet that the restraunts can use on a balcony one level up via a lift. The restaurant staff will show you where it is and unlock it. It isn't huge and turning space is limited so you may need to reverse out. I'd advice having someone with you to help with the door. The centre of Carlisle is quite old so access is difficult to find. The slight awkwardness of this toilet is worth the compromise 
2148,Terrible not easy to find nearest loos to entrance for ladies are up stone steps no ramp no rails
2149,staff seem nice enough.
2150,Staff are very helpful especially Shirley who works in the pet area
2151,"Return visitors to this wonderful cottage , The standard and quality of this cottage is outstanding ! Every base has been covered for visitors with mobility and sensory disability's . From wheelchairs to hearing loops and so many more too numerous to list . The amount of Information and guides for disabled visitors is immense . The host's really do go the extra mile to make sure there guests stay is as carefree and happy as possible . I would highly recommend this cottage to anyone ! you will not be disappointed . "
2152,You can tell someone has put a bit of thought into making the park accessible.. Impressed at the number of ramps throughout the park. Ramps also built so people can access the digtal displays...
2153,Signage was excellent and there were lifts between the platforms. Had never been to this station before and was able to find my way around easily. Nice clear audio announcements in plenty of time before trains arrived.
2154,Plenty accessible toilet facilities 
2155,"I did not have need to speak to staff this visit, but generally have found them helpful if I've needed to ask for things"
2156,"The hotel has excellent disabled access. It had the usual facilities you would expect to find in a Premier Inn hotel restaurant, bar area and there was also a Costa Coffee. The communal areas were step free, with lifts.   I had reserved an accessible room with walk in shower and when I arrived I was allocated what I had requested and I was pleased with the layout and cleanliness of my room.  The hotel although a little bit out of the main city centre has excellent public transport links, which made the location very easy to get to.  The only thing which I felt could be improved upon was the queuing, when I arrived the machine didn't accept my booking, there was a queue at receiption and I had to stand about 5 - 8 minutes before I was served. When I got the receiption I suggested that they have some fold up seats so people with mobility impairments can join, but don't have to stand in the queue. Likewise in the morning queuing for breakfast at the restaurant. These were little things that could make things a lot better for disabled customers, but it wouldn't put me off returning. "
2157,"During the 1840.s there were three stations in Edinburgh, collectively known as Waverley, but due to congestion at Waverley, plans were put forth to demolish all three stations and build just one large station, and by 1873 the new station was more suitable to take the extra traffic now needed. This soon became apparent it was not able to cope with so much more railway expansions, and a further alteration had to be made, and work began in 1892. It was a Hugh task, now to cover 23 acres  of ground, and it included the new entrance from Waverley Bridge, which had started in the 1873 plans, and a new ridge and furrow system roof was built to lay as low as possible so it would not spoil the city,s skyline. Then the first and second class waiting rooms were built, ( but now, sadly due to the COVID 19 problems, the first class lounge has been closed during 2020/21, and it remains to be seen if it will be reopened. ) Finally, the new station was opened in 1921. Over the years further improvements have had to be made, (bearing in mind the Listed status now held ) so any work has to have Listed building consent. In 1994 the railway was privatised, and by 2004 new projects were put in place, including lengthening of the platforms, and between 2010/2020 the roofs glazing was replaced with 27,000 new panes of glass. (Photo3) It is now one of the largest of all British stations. After having wheelchair assistance to get us off the platform at Waverley station, and along to the concourse (photo 1) which is all on the level, but very busy although we found everyone very friendly and helpful, including a number of passers by, who were very nice in allowing us to move around very easily, and my wife pushed me along to the lift (photo 2). We then rode up and across Waverley stations glass roof,  (Photo 3) exiting we moved along the Bridge walkway, and a long push for my wife, which would take us eventually to the way out for Princess street, to Another lift (photo 4) which took us up to the level needed for Princess street. (Photo 5).  A paved walkway (photo 6) took us along to Princess street (photo 7). All the main bus stops are along here (photo 8) which lead to Edinburgh castle. (Photo 9), and we had quite a view to the castle itself (photo 10). Crossing over Princess street, there are a number of hotels and restaurants. (Photo 11).  Our final thoughts. We enjoyed the train ride to Waverley station, arriving on time, and assistant service was there waiting for us, who took us along past all other platforms, we had arrived at the far end platform, so a long push for wheelchair, but it was easily handled for us, and it was no trouble using a number of lifts to get us up onto Princess street, so overall, an interesting journey, and we would suggest that if you are going to Edinburgh, you consider using the train service, as we found it so convient."
2158,"There is one official disabled parking place up at the house. You drive up a private lane/drive to the property. At the top of the drive there is a gate, depending on when you visit, you might have to get out, open it, drive through and get out again to close it. "
2159,"Excellent, everyone I met was very helpful and friendly and did everything they could to make my experience as smooth as possible. They were happy to lower their masks so I could lipread and provided any important information to me in written form to make sure I could fully understand. "
2160,"The staff were lovely, and they couldn't do enough to help."
2161,"Jane and Stuart were helpful and friendly, offering advice when needed."
2162,Lifts are located on each floor and only a short walk away from the car parking spaces.  Both lifts lead you on to each floor (3) of the gate building. There are also escalators on each floor.  All restaurants and services are easily accessed by wheelchair.
2163,"the help point is usually in one spot down the platform.  TFL are trying to upgrade the access but there's only 77 total completed out of 270 odd.  I was informed by a staff member some disability access was removed after completing 2012 olympics, but this is hearsay - although he had no reason to make it up."
2164,There was accessible parking but it was quite a trek from door. I didn't see any bays close by.
2165,Very good accessible on ground floor of the multi storey car park.
2166,Excellent inside the cafe and the shopping centre.   Seats are moveable.
2167,"There is a step at the entrance stopping wheelchair users from accessing the shop. However, if you can manage to walk in then you're in for a treat as the ice cream has won many awards and is the best that I have ever tasted. Something needs to be done about the step though, wheelchair users like ice cream too!! "
2168,We arrived on a coach which was a bit of a squeeze but we managed it. Decent size carpark with flat or ramped access to all buildings.
2169,"There are electrically operated push button doors at the front and rear of the hotel which are normally working but not on this visit. The hotel reception, restaurants and bars are all easily accessible. The accessible bedrooms are huge. These are set up as twin beds with plenty of space around the beds and a further large seating area opposite the beds (excuse poor photo attached). There is also a lot of accessible hanging and storage space for clothes. I have stayed in many hotels and these are by far the largest and most comfortable rooms. See comments on bathrooms"
2170,"The door to get in is not automatic and quite heavy but staff are always on desk and can help if needed. There is a large reception area with high desk. Past reception on the right is the bar, and restaurant which I had breakfast in. This was a good experience - self serve but things were low down and staff were always around to help if needed. There are lifts past reception that announce floors and doors opening in English. The corridors are spacious enough even if there is a cleaning trolley outside a room. The room itself was brilliant, lots of space and I was very comfortable."
2171,Accessible for wheelchairs. 
2172,We only briefly interacted with staff but they were all friendly. 
2173,Limitations of heritage site but when otherwise all fine and there was a computer to see the upper castle areas virtually.
2174,friendly
2175,Parking and transport might be an issue for some people as the Ligthouse is set in a side street off Buchanan Street which in itself is pedestrianised.
2176,"Poor staff attuide, towards my little boy in a wheel chair , and the family, then when putting a complaints in on a show with the sealions it got brushed off .said this rule apply to everyone. everyone app from the family that sit with the buggys and don't get asked to move like we did ."
2177,We visited the disabled toilets so we acknowledged that they were there.
2178,"There are signs indicating. No stairs, making it easier. And can't remember entirely but quite sure there are benches along the way."
2179,Very Friendly and helpful
2180,My room had a fully accessible wet room.
2181,"Can't comment on the parking. Karlsplatz U Bahn Station (fully accessible) is very close but the lift brings you out in what seemed like the wrong place. The safest route is to exit the station concourse in the direction away from the concert hall then turn left and walk through the gardens. Turn left into an underpass which takes you under the main road and you will find a lift that takes you up about 100 yards from the Musikverein, with no roads to cross."
2182,"Several bus routes will drop you off practically outside the restaurant. Highbury and Islington Overground station is nearby, and step-free, but Highbury and Islington tube station is *not* step-free. There is no other step-free station nearby. The nearest step-free tube station is King's Cross, which is well over a mile away."
2183,As expected. 
2184,"The signs clearly marked the disabled access, and where there were stairs/escalator, there was always an option too for a lift. It is moderately spacious though it might feel crowded to claustrophobic people. There are a lot of places to seat and rest. All the signage was in large print and could easily be read by most people."
2185,All on one level.  Seating provided if necessary.  All prices in large print.
2186,"Great.  Fairly new building, so plenty of ramps, lifts and wide doors. Lovely stalls with seats removed, but stools available for carers - we had a great view"
2187,Make booking over the phone and table was ready for us they even offered to take our orders at the table instead of the bar and also offered to collect our meals from the  carvery as well
2188,Easy on the flat access. I managed fine with my two sticks to get in and out the doorway.
2189,I think it had just opened but it was I really enjoyed the food and it was cheap!
2190,"Friendly, helpful and understanding "
2191,The accessible loo is well equipped and is pretty good. It is large enough to manoeuvre and has grab rails. It is just of the main foyer area right next the the ladies loos and is easy to locate. There is enough room for a carer.
2192,The cafe /kiosk is only open and staffed during summer months (early May to end September) . So limited feedback as not possible to quiz staff until later in the year. Park rangers maintain park year round and are helpful.
2193,"Didn't use them but if they are in the same league as everywhere else, they'll be good. This is a newly renovated community space. "
2194,"Whitmuir is a great place to go when you want to escape the busy life of the city of Edinburgh. The drive from Edinburgh was short (under 30 mins). There is disabled parking just beside the main building.At Whitmuir there is a Cafe and bistro (a good selection of cakes, beverages and a lunch menu), Farm Shop (organic food and veg also children's toys), Art gallery(paintings, prints, sculptures and jewellery etc), Plant nursery and Antiques. Most areas are wheelchair accessible with the exception of the plant nursery. The entrance has a double main door and there is a disabled toilet. We have a lovely time. cakes were yummy and it was great to get out into the countryside."
2195,Generally quite an easy and straight forward access - no hassle - for home AND away fans!
2196,"Signage good, no steps a well maintained not too steep ramp"
2197,The Harry Potter Shop and the photograph experience at platform 9 3/4 was accessible. Situated on and by the concourse you can wheel in and get to see everything.
2198,"Considering the age of the building, the access was excellent."
2199,The staff helped with any questions I had and gave me access into the gym to have a look around. 
2200,Perfect.  No problems at all for us.   The lift is not massive and the corridors are slightly narrow but saw plenty of adults using wheelchairs getting on fine (though you many struggle with a very power one)
2201,as I recognised building and had been there before I didn't rely on it.
2202,Mixed! Parking a bit of a nightmare - but it was the festival... Lots of bus stops nearby. Plus a tram stop right next door.
2203,Couldn’t not have done more they should be proud of themselves.
2204,all staff helpful
2205,Only used one disabled toilet which was large enough to drive in and out on the scooter
2206,Staff were welcoming and helpful. Everyone spoke English.
2207,Interior access mostly via very steep ramps.  Access to lift restricted to staff only.  Staff not willing to allow access as unaware ramps were steep. 
2208,Ramps good but don’t cover all the site.
2209,"Once inside, the smooth floors and accessible loo are plus points. However there is a sizeable step at the front door, there's a bit of a trek from the car park, internal steps to the restaurant. The accessible loo needs extra grab rails and an alarm cord in order to be suitable for most needs."
2210,"Very helpful and willing, with pleasant attitude towards disabled, and we were made to feel welcomed by them all."
2211,"This temporary venue for Edinburgh Rugby  may be good for the players and able-bodied fans but is hopeless for disabled supporters (if I wasn't such a rugby nut, I wouldn't have bothered!)"
2212,"If you or your child like Space, then this is a nice trip out. Good displays with lots of 'spacey'  information and some interactive play.Completely accessible building with ramps and a lift. The actual building isn't somewhere you can spend a whole day at so I think it is on the expensive side for what it is (small concession discount but no carers in for free).  You can also go on a 60 minute round trip on the ferry. "
2213,There are disabled parking spaces available outside the Vikingar centre it is also possible to walk along the prom from the train station .
2214,"Local buses, on street parking, down at the bottom of a hill."
2215,"Park in private drive, level access to house. If you don't want to drive and there are disabled people in the group, then I don't have any hesitation in recommending C & A taxis in Polis. They have minibuses with lifts in the back and passengers who can't leave their wheelchairs, are anchored to the floor. It costs approx. £140 for a return journey and takes 45 minutes from Paphos airport. When you have to leave your villa, they will collect your luggage and you can either go to C & A when you are ready, and their whole family is very welcoming."
2216,"Large car park right next to it, with accessible bays.  We used the postcode for the New Boston Hotel opposite and found it easily.  "
2217,A first post Covid-19 trip to a supermarket.
2218,"no changing place toilet that i saw but spacious toilets with grab rail and one was a closomat toilet.  There was a seat raise but it did not fit on the closomat toilet. There was a second downstairs toilet but it had a sink very close to it so i dont know if the raise seat would have fit on there, my dad would not have been able to get up from that toilet. "
2219,"Undulation paving, forest type paths or compacted soil. Ramps have lips to get onto them in some areas. Swing doors or heavy doors to the indoor areas and lemur walk though (only open a few hours a day). Penguins have a walkway which does not allow a chair and pram to easily pass. Some enclosures difficult to see. Reptiles are 2-3 'shelves' high. Easy to see big cats, free flying birds, wolves, meerkats, penguins, some reptiles and red pandas from low height."
2220,Great - access to the terminal building easy.
2221,"Good, monitored accessible car park.  They divert disabled drivers to additional proximal parking when the lot fills.  There is now an accessible bus that goes around the site."
2222,Staff were exceptionally helpful. With the staff member at the ticket desk taking a good bit of time to explain the best accessible ways to see the different places along the poets path. Also explaining there is large print versions of text which can be requested at reception desk
2223,"We visited to see the Wheelchair Tennis Masters 2016 which was sublime.  Inside the building is good for access, though I didn't see a large number of accessible loos (however what there was was good).  There was a free shuttle bus transfer from Stratford on this particular occasion which was fully accessible.  Food venue (on site but separate) was level access though with heavy doors.  Paths outside all level, automatic doors to venue. Tennis Courts had flip up seats and wheelchairs could park up there on front row, anywhere you liked. "
2224,"Popped in for a coffee, which was good. Pleasant staff served me. Lots of space around counter but not much around the tables unless outside. A ramp enabled me to access more tables and toilet. "
2225,"Exploring Princes Street and feeling the need to ""take time out"" it was great to dip into the Gardens and see the green space, grab a coffee and admire the engineering of the Festival Wheel."
2226,"Small ramp at entrance, wide doors. Pavement outside quite messy and uneven."
2227,always plenty of staff to help however in busy periods this may not be the case
2228,Did not have the need to use but I did see the door
2229,A wheelchair accessible restaurant. With friendly in store staff.
2230,"The staff are very welcoming and kind,caring and nice to everyone."
2231,being able to get round the park on my own
2232,"Currently showing the 'School of Rock' musical - which was excellent - the New London Theatre is in Drury Lane, the heart of Theatre Land.  I was surprised by the limited number of spaces for wheelchair users, however those which were there, had a very good view of the stage."
2233,"As a support worker this was a working holiday, supporting a lady with special needs who needs a wheelchair whilst out and about. The cottage suited our needs perfectly, spacious for moving around inside cottage. Fabulous wet room, with everything needed to hand. Ideal location for peace and tranquility. Also lovely to sit outside taking in views of beautiful countryside with coffee and cake."
2234,"Friendly and helpful both at Amsterdam Centraal Station, on the train and in Paris The stewardess on the train took the trouble to point out the alarm button in the accessible loo, and when no ramp appeared at the Gare du Nord, she phoned through to summon one. The ramp operator was very apologetic about the delay."
2235,The staff were good and helpful.
2236,"The grave is about a 15 minutes walk from Great Missenden Train Station. There are regular trains from London. Exiting the station from trains from London, there is a choice of a footbridge with no lift or a step free, slightly uphill path, which is signposted Way Out and with a wheelchair symbol, see photo.   I walked from the station. Then there is a slight hill street down to the High Street. The High Street is flat and walk by the Roald Dahl Museum and turn left into Church Street. I would suggest crossing over to the opposite side of Church Street as it easier to cross here than further up. Then turn right into Church Lane. Soon after the turning the road goes uphill slightly, but enough to make me feel out of breath, see photo. There is one part of the pavement when I visited that was overgrown with brambles and I had to walk on the road. (At this point I got chatting to a lady taking her dog for a walk and mentioned this. She said that unless there is a service/event on at the church there is usually very few cars along that road. A little further up there is a bridge to cross and then directly afterwards the Church of St Peter and Paul is on the right and the cemetery on the left.  If you had a car/ taxi you could go to the entrance of the cemetery."
2237,"There are two accessible toilets. One in the main diner and one accessed from the ramp for outside diners. I've never used the outside one but the inside one is lovely and clean, big enough to turn around in and easily accessible."
2238,"I was very impressed at the number of lifeguards there were at all areas of the Park and how attentive they were. In several places there are lifeguards actually standing in the water, not just looking on from a distance.  The park is extremely clean, considering how many people visit it, there is no rubbish or anything left lying about. There are staff cleaning constantly.  All staff I spoke to were helpful. "
2239,"Over the years I have visited La Cala De Mijas many times, which is in the Costa Del Sol, Spain.  In the past it has not been the most accessible place, however, the community and local committee have been working to change that. They have taken up all of the public paths and replaced them, making them wider and ensuring they are all level and accessible for wheelchairs, which makes getting around the town a lot easier. Furthermore, they have put boardwalks all along the beach so people who may have mobility difficulties are able to access the beach and sea, with regular monitoring from lifeguards. At the Lifeguard station they have made accessible sun-loungers on a level access floor on the beach and have also provided wheelchairs and walking sticks that can be used on the sand and in the sea to make access into the water easier for everyone. they have also included a disabled friendly outside shower on the beach, and this is based near a disabled toilet. The Lifeguards are always willing to help and are very friendly and regularly patrol the whole of the beach. All of the public transport is very cheap and accessible for wheelchair users.  This is a great holiday destination for families to visit as they are constantly looking at new ways to improve their facilities."
2240,"This is where the 'bad' bit comes in. From the ground floor access is made to the loo upstairs via a lift. It tends to be mucky inside and out. The accessible female toilet is at the dear end of the ladies toilet - that's not a problem, personally, but despite the sink inside and soap (if it's a good day!) there is no hand-drying facility available."
2241,"Couldn't get in because of a small step, so unfortunately can't comment. "
2242,"All very friendly, kind and helpful."
2243,"Due to the layout/design of the building, toilets are situated pool-side (though bear in mind this is an Edwardian building). There is a disabled access toilet and changing facilities."
2244,"Majority of airport has good access. As mentioned drop off points for access quite a distance from airport entrance. Airport assistance is available and help phones situated throughout airport, it's advisable to pre book assistance with airline beforehand. Once security has been cleared, extremely steep ramp needs to be accessed, impossible for self propelling manual wheelchair, and challenging for those assisting! Problems accessing plane as the ambulift was not placed flush with door of plane, despite saying that was as close as they could get it, they managed to get it flush after the air stewardess suggested they got a lift on chair( I'm on the large side) same problem on the way back with ambulift. These were the least helpful of all the staff in the airport. Allowed to take my crutches onto plane, and given a seat near the front. I have travelled all over the world , and this is the only airport where there has been problems ,getting the ambulift close to the door. "
2245,The accessible loo was available and had a reasonable size room and facilities. It was clean and very usable
2246,There isn't any parking as its in the center but car parks close by.
2247,"Just over 3 miles from Droitwich, the Aztec adventure park was quite easy to find using sat NAV."
2248,All the staff and volunteers were very helpful all going out of their way to make sure that they guests had a very good respite experience.  As I have been several times I received a very warm greeting.  It would be wrong to single out anyone who was “particularly helpful” because they all were.
2249,"This was my first visit to the Dakota hotel in Glasgow. I had visited their hotel at euro central, it's just off the M8 motorway on the way to Motherwell, so I knew what standard to expect and I wasn't disappointed. Their buildings look like something from Gotham city in a Batman movie. Inside the hotel the lighting is quite low so may cause problems for people with visual impairments, I think this is to create a Gothic feel to the place."
2250,Good size and clean. Liked the sign beside the door!
2251,Staff did very well to help get a specific room that would accommodate my needs and were available for any more assistance
2252,Access in and around the building:  The main entrance has a traditional revolving door. Alongside is a small ramp built into the entrance and a wide access door. It was easy to get through and a concierge was quickly on hand to hold the door.  Once in the building the reception is in front of you. There were plenty of staff on hand.  The building is on several floors. One of many lifts leads from reception to the upper floors. My powerchair is quite large at 68 cm wide and 116 cm in length so I used the service lift – not that I knew it was a service lift until later.  The wide corridors to the accessible bedrooms were amazing. Once had enough space for a seating area and a piano! Apparently this stems for from the days of ladies in the grand ball gowns not wishing to touch another lady’s gown as they swept along the corridor to the grand staircase.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible bedroom was a surprise in that the door opened to reveal so much space. The room door had a clearance of 86 cm so plenty of room to wheel in.  There were no tight corners and tricky turns to be done here! With access to both sides of the beds and a large seating area it was great.  The accessible wet room was spacious and had a door the same size as the room door; again no tight turns. With an integral shower and plenty of space around the toilet it worked well for me.  The two accessible rooms are identical.   Access in the dining area:  The hotel offers several items for dining or getting light refreshments. Peacock Alley offers a lounge style area where you can relax and admire the old station architecture or just watch the gentle movement of the station clock as time ticks away.  The adjacent Brassiere provides breakfast and other dining options during the day. The hotel’s Pompadour restaurant offers fine dining and great views. I visited all three during my visit and they were all easy to get in and move around. Furniture could be moved to make access easier and the staff were magnificent.  Access to other facilities:  The hotel does have a spa and swimming pool. I ventured down to visit these and whilst not going as far as swimming I can confirm that there is an accessible changing room!
2253,A completely unexpected access experience. A tunnel built in 1902 so that south London residents could go to work in the docks on the Isle of Dogs turns out to be a great find.
2254,You go through a door and go past the disabled toilet and your seat is right there.
2255,You can park on the high street next to the coffee shop
2256,The bus goes from the high street nearby. I think you can park on streets nearby.
2257,"Can't fault it, just take care in the car park as lighting is poor and seeing little pot holes was a little difficult.   No steps, not even any lips or door ways steps to manoeuvre. Was dark inside but it was an awards ceremony so always going to be a little dimmer."
2258,It's all flat.
2259,"Just asked for a table suitable for wheelchair, given a choice of places, chairs removed without trouble to give access."
2260,"I found the wheelchair access to be good apart from the difficulty with the paths, which were uneven and steep in many places."
2261,Brilliant. Live the lift.
2262,"Excellent, the event centre has recently installed a changing place facility making days out more accessible for all.  Without this it is difficult to enjoy family days out."
2263,"Poor old lovely Thekla, it is a boat, on three levels, so not the easiest venue for the mobility impaired.   There are rather a lot of stairs.  See disabled access details below.  They do give free carer passes though, if you call them in advance.  The staff are generally friendly and helpful."
2264,"The journey here was okay. We came, as advised by the site, from Skipton up a B road to Grassington, which was fine. You turn left off this road in Thresfields, up a long dead end. Initially, this is a normal road but the last km or so is the narrowest single track road ever! I was driving the car and had to do a double take. Hubby was following in the motorhome. He must have wondered where we were going. Glad we took the car, as days out, getting the motorhome up and down that lane would have been stressful!"
2265,"Apart from the odd incline, the interior was all level access.  Corriders were a bit narrow and turns rather tight for wheelchairs; rooms however were a good size."
2266,"The restaurant car park is directly next to the ramped, level access.  Good bus service"
2267,"There is great disabled access to the commonwealth pool. I find it very easy to find my way around. However, I think it might be quite difficult to use if you are a wheelchair user."
2268,"The staff a very helpful,polite, they can't do enough to help you. They are really fantastic with the children, they helped with Adams equipment. Near steps , the food is really good would recommend the waterfall cafe."
2269,We stayed here overnight in one of the hotels accessible rooms. I cannot recomend it highly enough. The room was very spacious with 2 twin beds. The room had an on suite bathroom with handrails and a pull down shower seat. There is a red cord in the shower. Ther is also an emergency call button in the room itself. Staff are so friendly and helpful and complete an personal Emergency Evacuation plan with all Disabled guests. All Travelodge accessible rooms should have wet room bathrooms available.
2270,No wheelchair access apart from slope from car park leading to step into building.
2271,quite difficult to find but there were a couple toilets
2272,There is a large step up into the pub and the pub doesn't have a wheelchair ramp and the staff don't care.
2273,"Run by a highly-talented husband and wife team, this cafe serves savoury meals as well as patisserie and great coffee. It is also a good place to buy bread. The only reason we haven't given this venue five stars is that there is no accessible loo. It is excellent in every other way."
2274,Designated parking outside each of the properties . We stayed at Hidelow house which sleeps 4 .
2275,It has step free access to the premises. It's quite tight with tables inside but the staff got me a suitable table. 
2276,Path along side edge of car park goes to toilet.    Terrain rough underfoot for a manual or powerchair but you can buy an ice cream and stay at the top and enjoy the views. 
2277,"Small public gardens, next to the entrance to the Old Fortress. Originally known as Bosketto Gardens, but was re-named Bosketto Durrell in 2016, in honour of the writers Gerald and Lawrence Durrell. "
2278,"The staff were nice and good service, although I didn't need any extra help."
2279,"Friendly staff who ask if you need assistance and will come to the table to serve you from a bar menu. Easy assess from car park outside. Clean, well arranged disabled toilet. Has a disabled room on ground floor with parking right outside for an overnight stay."
2280,"Croy railway station is easy to access with ramps to both platforms, an accessible toilet, good parking, bus links, and very helpful staff."
2281,"There were 3 steps with a handrail into the main entrance. Once inside everything was step free and on the ground floor. La Rotonde restaurant is on the ground floor. There is step free access to the main restaurant but the mezzanine level is only accessible by stairs. I ate my dinner in the restaurant's garden, which had step free access, and a view overlooking the Prom des Anglais. There were free standing tables and chairs."
2282,Not sure about public transport access but no problem parking in the dedicated parking space outside the chalet.
2283,"For me, access to public transport was important as a visually impaired person.  Frequent buses pass by the front door to all parts of the city. There are bus stops on both sides of the road and traffic lights make for a safe road crossing."
2284,"I managed to get into the disabled toilet but it was a bit tricky. There was not a lot of room to turn round in front of the door to go in straight. And inside the toilet, the space was only just big enough for my powerchair.  It could have been better but it could also have been worse."
2285,Roomy toilets
2286,I was meeting a group of friends for lunch at the cafe of the Forth Valley Sensory Centre. It had been a number of years since I had visited the sensory centre and I had only been there for work meetings previously so was nice to visit in a more social capacity. I notified the venue that I would be arriving to meet friends for lunch using the Welcome by Neatebox app they have installed which alerts staff to any accessibility and assistance requirements you have before you arrive at their venue. I arrived with a fellow guide dog owner and we were met at the entrance of the building and shown through to the cafe where some of our friends had already arrived. 
2287,"Getting in is OK but they have baskets around that make it awkward, items are out of reach and there is a lack of staff to help"
2288,"They have accessible toilets, which are accessible on the 2nd floor next to the cafe."
2289,North Berwick High Street can be a bit of a nightmare to park in. We were very lucky and parked right outside hence the 5 star rating. If you are unlucky you might find you have to park a long way away.
2290,Easy to find as the lift up to the 3rd floor opens at the cafe. Easy to order food and drinks. Space to park my scooter alongside a table. Not expensive. Disabled toilet was quite small as my photo shows and the red cord wasn't long enough.
2291,The venue is well away from adequate parking and public transport. The venture itself has some obvious positives but some very big negatives. 
2292,Nearest tube station is Piccadilly Circus but this is not wheelchair accessible. There are plenty of buses on Piccadilly.  Nearest carpark is in Leicester Square. We parked for free in the Royal Academy opposite as we were visiting an exhibition - there are 2 BlueBadge parking spaces which you can book in advance.
2293,Friendly attentive staff
2294,Access was easy to parts of the public site and the have a changing place toilet 
2295,Visited for a quick drink on New Years Eve and was pleasantly surprised at the facilities in such a small space!
2296,"Step free access to get in, it was easy to get around inside- plenty of space. It was quite well signposted and we enjoyed having a nosey about. I could reach most of the shelves which was nice! In the cafe the tables are quite low and in my power chair I cant get underneath, I imagine manual chairs with armrests also wouldn't get under although your legs might! The chairs are hard wood so I didn't transfer into one. It is table service and the staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed out coffees and cakes, at 4 o clock the staff were cleaning and putting chairs on tables and at 4:30 they started sweeping and mopping which kind of ruined the vibe so we left early, the cafe shuts at 5. "
2297,There are disabled parking spaces right next to The Sandcastle.
2298,"There are two accessible toilets and the CP toilets. I followed the signs that were clearly marked and directed me to the toilets on the first floor where the management suite can be found. I did not take much notice of the two accessible toilets however as the CP toilets were at a very high standard I would expect that they would be as well. In the Changing Places toilet there was: Bench - Height Adjustable, Adult Sized, Wall Mounted Hoist - Ceiling Toilet Washbasin Height Adjustable Emergency Alarms Privacy Screen"
2299,Access to the swimming pool is very easy for all with disabled access and facilities.
2300,"No steps, completely flat except for a very small ramp to go to the gym and one of the smaller sports halls. Apart from that you can access every room.  It must be good if you've got so many disability sports clubs running down there :)"
2301,"Easy access to viewing platform, great view of stage. However ramp was steep"
2302,The staff were fantastic and could not have done any more.
2303,Access across the railway at Westerton Train Station used to be via a narrow pedestrian bridge making it very difficult for anyone with impaired mobility to access both platforms.  The old bridge was replaced in 2018 by a new wider bridge and lifts have been installed making it easier for all passengers to cross the railway to the opposite platform.
2304,All staff are friendly and very helpful. Restaurant staff reserved a table for us beside the buffet
2305,"To busy to be helpful, reception staff not at all interested, and waitress staff also quiet busy on our visit, so it’s disappointing."
2306,"There is a ramp to the front door. The ramp is of a solid stone construction and is rather steep. Not horribly or impossibly steep, but a bit of an effort in a manual wheelchair and it could be a bit of a skid if you come down it in the rain.   The front door is a bit heavy but there are always people who jump out of nowhere to help.   The café is small and it can be quite difficult and awkward to find a comfortable place to park in your wheelchair for a nice relaxed snack or drink, because the tables and seating are quite crammed together."
2307,"too many cars on forecourt, not a single disabled space, sloping surfaces make wheelchair use extremely difficult"
2308,"If arriving by public transportation, Groet is accessible by bus from the Alkmaar train station. If you have special needs, be sure to call in advance to ensure the bus is suitable for your needs.  If arriving by taxi, the company Accessible Travel Netherlands can make arrangements for you.  If traveling by car, accessible parking is available near the restaurant.  The restaurant can also be accessed from many of the bicycle trails in the area."
2309,Good space and grab rails round the loo. Not sure whether side transfer is feasible - we couldn't work out whether/how the baby changing bench (which is close to the loo) folds up. The washbasin is approachable and there's the usual Ditch round the room at skirting board level alarm cord.
2310,"Just had a quick peek in the loo, not enough room to take my scooter in, whilst it appears larger than a normal sized loo there wasn't a lot of room for manoeuvering a wheelchair and having an assistant. It was clean and easy to locate, with a grab rail."
2311,"There are disabled spaces surrounding George Square but these are for permit holders at the University of Edinburgh. There is a risk of a ticket if you do not have a permit as well as a blue badge. There are many bus routes around the area, 7, 14, 35, 300, 31, 23. These have lowered buses and ramps for wheelchair users. For those who self propel or have difficulties walking it is a fair distance from most bus stops to the venue over uneven ground and cobbles. The nearest train station is Waverley."
2312,The crew on board the ship consisted of the captain and permanent crew who taught and showed us the volunteer crew what to do. The crew were very good at teaching us the ropes and safety while we were at sea.
2313,"We went to the cafe first which is on the ground floor. There are automatic doors and then level access. Next to the cafe are male/female/accessible toilets.  There is a lift to go to the main arena - we didnt realise at first that the lift is outside, beside the stairs. So if in the cafe, you need to go back out to this. It is signposted on the wall outside, but high up, and we hadn't noticed it, however staff were helpful when we asked about it.  From the lift, you go to level 3, and it is then level access. In the foyer (when basketball on) there are a variety of food and merchandise stands. There are also can/snack machines throughout.  In the arena there are many wheelchair spaces all on the same level as the entrance and foyer. They each have at least one seat next to them and are in short rows spaced right around the arena.  Steps to other seats. Yellow edging on steps but didn't have handrails most of the way. Flip-up seats.  For Basketball the arena was quite noisy. This might not suit everybody, but for others it adds to the experience and atmosphere."
2314,Very helpful and nice.
2315,I didn't use it but there was one so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt!
2316,Parked in the car park next to bowls club on Commercial road. Had plenty of disabled bays. Got 1 extra hour parking. Was fairly easy to get to the cafe - no major hills.
2317,"From the moment I arrived at the venue, I was guided by friendly staff every step of the way. The music room is via a short lift journey. A member of staff them made the crowd part so that I could be escorted to my wheelchair spot like a VIP.  Located at the front, I was immersed in the show from start to finish!"
2318,"We arrived in Cardiff by train, there is a train station next to the hotel although you need to walk around the block (250 yds approx) to the disabled access entrance. There was on street parking outside the hotel although we didn't use it. As the hotel is in the city centre, accessible public transport is good. There is also a dedicated mobility assistance vehicle which you can book or flag down."
2319,Staff were helpful and when asked where things were gave clear and accurate directions.
2320,Lots of disabled parking. I don't think you could get there via public transport -even if you can use public transport
2321,The only let down here is there is no emergency cord apart from that the toilet is accessible very easily for a disabled person on their own  although door may be a problem for the person to close on their own as opens outwards.
2322,"W H Smith is generally accessible throughout, with level entrance. Front doors are automatic, and 1400mm wide. Till height is 1000mm, with a side writing ‘desk’ at  820mm. Induction hearing loop available at the till. No Braille aids but they have a magnifying glass. No seating available. Staff are friendly and will shop for customers who find it difficult to move around."
2323,The toilet in the room was large and had the standard grip rails around the toilets and shower you expect in a hotel  There is a fold down seat in the shower that is set at a standard level they  normal are  when you switch the bedroom lights off at night a Green safety light comes on in the toilet that allows you to see with out putting lights on during the night  The only problem was the Red cord was around 2 feet short of the floor I did leave a Red Cord Card in place
2324,"Step free access, space to move around within the space, and staff willing to help."
2325,"Plenty spaces, but a bit cramped."
2326,"Flat easy access into bui!ding. Easy to manoeuvre with chair or scooter and a choice of places to eat and drink. Nice views. Biggest improvement is massive toilet, accessed using RADAR key. It has full size file down bed. Tracks are fitted to ceiling for hours use. The sink moves electrically up and down. It's not perfect but one of the best I've seen. Lots of room to move around but why to do many put the soap / towels in such an inaccessible place."
2327,"When arriving at Morrison's I could see there was ample blue badge spaces situated near the front of the store.  The store entrance is covered over and is on the same level as the car park making access easy.  Once inside the store I could see the isles were wide enough for their own shop mobility scooters, and suitable for most wheelchairs or walking aids.  The toilets are easily accessible and just inside the entrance to the right, next to the kiosk. The toilets are locked, and you can obtain the key from staff at the kiosk.  Staff were very bright, friendly and accommodating, advising location of wheelchair trolleys.  "
2328,"Family of 8 plus 2 dogs.  Kraig has cerebal palsy, epilepsy, and hydrocephalus, he is non-weight bearing and confined to a wheelchair.  He is unable to use controls so is fully dependant on his family.  We needed an accessible property that was suitable for quite a large family and accommodated pets too.  We also wanted the use of a swimming pool with hoist access for Kraig.  Heath View met our requirements and more.  The owners have thought of everything, there is so much to do you do not need to leave the area.  There was indoor table tennis and table football.  Chickens and ducks in the shared gardens, along with trampoline, huge sandpit, in-door heated swimming pool and also a hot tub.  There are plenty of books, games, and toys to keep the little ones amused.  A well equipped kitchen, and utility area.  The area feels tranquil, peaceful and rural, yet only a short drive away is numerous restaurants, cinema and shops.  The pictures do not do this place justice."
2329,"handy for city centre, car parking for guests available locally."
2330,"Green Park tube station is about half a mile away and is fully step-free, served by Victoria, Jubilee and Piccadilly Lines."
2331,"It is six years since Lauriston Farm changed from Brewers Fayre to Toby Carvery, but I must confess that this is the first time I have been there since - I was pleasently surprised.  Good food, good service and decent access."
2332,Toilets were acceptable - which is better than most public facilities. They were modern
2333,"A lovely countryside driving area, takes you to this farm, with a very large car park, laid with compressed chippings and easy to push around.  There are just two disabled bays, but all bays are easy enough to use."
2334,"Virtually the whole garden is accessible. The paths are mainly tarmac or fine gravel, some are rougher gravel and some are grass – this was a bit bumpy for comfort but we didn’t have to go that way, we could have back tracked and stayed on the smoother paths. There are also plenty of benches. "
2335,"No signage, but resort map  provided. Flat access everywhere on the site. Lifts to the room, smooth limestone floors everywhere. Wheelchair accessible rooms in hotel.with plenty of room, beds with legs for hoist access, shower seat, grab rails and raised loo in bathroom. No access to room's balcony. Access not guaranteed in apartments. Ramps and absence of steps meant the whole site was accessible except for the beach terrace and Dead Sea access. The spa offered flotation in Dead Sea waters as an alternative. The spa was partially accessible and pools on the site had ladder and step access but no pool hoist available. Dining room  had part accessibility, with other restaurants and bar all with full access. Staff were incredibly helpful."
2336,There is a carpark with disabled bays close to the entrance. I've been to this attraction many times and never had a problem finding a disabled bay.
2337,"The disabled car parking spaces were extremely wide, so the car doors were able to open to their full potential to ensure that a disabled or wheelchair user can easily get in and out of the car. There is no restricted access to the rear of the vehicle either, so that a ramp can easily be located for assistance. The spaces are located near to the entrance, with the pathway there being level.  "
2338,"This is an art gallery in Saskatoon, in Saskatchewan, Canada. It houses some interesting pieces of art, with a big focus on the history of the area. The buildling itself is beautiful. The name of the museum/gallery is written in one of the local native languages, with the name in all the other languages displayed above a cute fireplace in the lobby.  There is a gorgeous shop and restaurant (though do watch for the tendency to make you wait standing up while they faff around). They host visiting exhibitions too so there is always something interesting to see. "
2339,I took my mobility car and found no parking near the store. Also some of the car parks are small with only two or three disabled spaces meaning I had to park further away. This is not great when the weather is bad.
2340,Wheelchair access is excellent throughout. Avoid the cobbled front courtyard by taking the pavements running around its perimeter. Stone ramps lead to the main entrance. Staff are quick to spot you and will open the flat (non-revolving) doors. The lift to upper floors is brilliant and spacious. Full marks.
2341,"No automatic door, section we were in was a bit cramped."
2342,The staff were all very nice and friendly and offered additional help if needed
2343,There is no disabled parking but there are spaces near by. Bus stop right outside
2344,Accessible parking is available 
2345,"Staff very polite, friendly and helpful."
2346,There are no step-free stations nearby but several bus routes serve the area. I wouldn't dream of trying to park anywhere nearby.
2347,"Parking was on public streets in Chester, directly outside. The streets are semi pedestrianised with some cobbles but plenty of drop downs. Chester Bus Station is in the next street for public transport links. "
2348,"Can’t fault them in anyway, great attitude, welcoming, friendly and informative - really give the impression they like being there and care."
2349,The staff are very friendly and will accommodate those who require assistance. 
2350,The journey along the river is very pretty and there is enough to spend two half days ( or one full day) enjoying the attractions at either end (rare breeds farm one end and otters and butterflies and station facilities at the other). There is also a miniature outdoor railway and river walks if you don't mind some grassy path sections. Train is very easy to access at Buckfastleigh which has the better station facilities.
2351,"This Review has been left via Sculthorpe Moors Trip Adviser.    I'm so pleased that I stumbled across this Little Gem whilst looking online for reserves with wheelchair access!  When we arrived at the visitor centre the staff couldn't have been more helpful. I had my crutches with me as I can't walk very far at all without sitting down, but the staff lent me a wheelchair and let us park further down where the boardwalk starts.   The very first birds we saw included 3 beautiful male Bullfinches and 1 female, Blue, Great and Marsh tits, Greenfinches, Chaffinches, Goldfinches, Goldcrests and Nuthatches.  The reserve is an enchanting mix of woodland, marshland, rivers, dykes and reeds. It truly is a beautiful place and I can't wait to go back as soon as possible.  There are several hides, all wheelchair accessible with large windows low enough so that people  can get a good view. There is a Hide 4 meters above the ground. Even this is wheelchair accessible via a long ramp."
2352,"All of the staff were excellent, they are all professional and very aware of disability needs as far as clay shooting goes. "
2353,The doors to the entrance are not automatic so require manually opening unless they have been wedged at the door. The whole of the restaurant is level access except one part of the seating area has steps up to the seats. There are however plenty of level access seats elsewhere in the restaurant. The tables are close together so may need moving and arranging to fit a wheelchair in. 
2354,"Easy to find with space to manouvre/include a carer, but not super clean."
2355,The signage was great from my point of view however i did not notice any braille. 
2356,"Apparently they do have a disabled toilet, but it cannot be accessed by wheelchair as it is on a different level"
2357,"Busy and popular pizzaria in a lively, padestrianised street."
2358,Very good happy to bring our drinks up to the top level (top bar is not open in the daytime)
2359,There is ample parking with blue badge designated parking spaces near both entrances. There is a bus stop just outside the centre which is covered by quite a few different bus routes. There is also a taxi rank just outside. 
2360,Car park shared with other buildings but disabled parking is closest to the Science Centre building.  A considerable walk from car park to entrance if you are using sticks. We did not know but we're told by staff that our parking ticket was put through a machine which cancels out the fee. Therefore disabled parking is FREE.
2361,"There is a loo in the swimming pool changing area, which felt a little cramped, but had everything I needed. There is another accessible loo too, which felt less cramped though, as it didn’t have any other equipment in it."
2362,"During my visit i was assessing how accessible asda in newmains was for disabled access, overall i would conclude that my trip was very good. In the car park there is a number of disabled car parking spaces right next to the shop entrance making it very easy to enter the store. The store is all on one level making this extra accessible for people in wheelchairs or with walking aids etc. There are a few disabled toilets which are also all easily accessed on the ground floor."
2363,The G & V Hotel is a modern building with a prime location on the George IV bridge and adjacent to the Royal Mile. With seven accessible bedrooms; four with interconnecting rooms it’s a great location being only a short distance from many of Edinburgh’s tourist attractions.
2364,Enough space and had rails.
2365,South side Scran  The Southside Scran (see photo) opened in a December 2018. We went at the end of January. The bistro is wheelchair accessible. Inside the dining areas are on split levels. We sat at a table that was at pavement level. It was tucked around the corner and so away from any drafts from the entrance door. We were lucky as there were only a few other customers in that particular area and so it was relatively easy to move the wheelchair around. If there had been people on the  surrounding tables it might have been a little tight for space.  The lower dining area is approximately 4 steps down. I am not sure if they have a ramp which would allow access to wheelchair users. I would suggest that when booking it would probably be best to ask for a table that is at pavement level. The food was delicious (see photos) and the staff were lovely and helpful. There is a disabled toilet near the entrance. We drove to the bistro and parked just outside after the bus stop.we went on a Thursday evening but it may be more difficult at different times of the day and different days of the  week. There are also  several buses which stop near to the venue. I would definitely recommend the Southside Scran. We all had a great evening.😋
2366,"Access via ramped entrance at side of building. Not used by able bodied so no trampling over you at the end of a show. On arrival you ring the bell on door and a member of staff will let you in and escort you to the bar or auditorium. There is a lift to first floor where bar is. Staff are happy to help and disabled aware. I like how the staff speak directly to my wheelchair bound husband and not me, making him feel valued. Visibility of stage from where the wheelchair spaces are is very good."
2367,Wheelchair accessible community cafe offering excellent homebakes and light meals.
2368,I would advise on taking a taxi to and from Maspalomas but the kerbs are difficult for wheelchair users.
2369,Fine if you can use sticks but a big step for those who cannot transfer.
2370,Parking available on Albert Place and surrounding streets - if you're lucky. Plenty of buses on Leith Walk (city-bound stop right outside) and a taxi can drop off outside.
2371,There are clearly signed accessible toilets. They are of a good size for manoeuvring a wheelchair and we have always found them to be clean. The ground floor accessible loo is in a rather busy spot just inside the main foyer and you need to be careful when opening the door not to bump into someone. It is also a busy spot to wait if the loo is in use.
2372,Possible
2373,"Lovely restaurant that has just been extended. Fully wheelchair accessible, all on one level. A fantastic store with high quality home decor, homeware, gifts, food, and plants. Wheelchairs to borrow at the entrance."
2374,"Disappointing. There is a step to get up to enter the hotel, and no ramp could be seen. It is quite hard for wheelchair to get past reception desk and into the lift, which is rather small and tight, and I took off rather a lot of skin on my Knuckles as I tried to get in lift. It was untidy in its hall as well, and as it next to reception desk, we had to wait a few times for staff to finish helping other guests before we could get to the lift, which by the way, we didn’t mind. However, we did see all we needed to, most of the building is on the level, and there are plenty of seating areas. "
2375,"I arrived by train with Virgin Express which was fantastic. However the communication and release of tickets with shuttle bus details at the festival end was very confusing and last minute. This late release of details extended to those using the park and ride as the festival were deciding whether it would be safe to let people park on a floodplain...From other people's experiences, I heard that this decision-making delay also led to a late release of accessibility information which accompanied tickets. "
2376,"The staff made this stay what it was.  From check-in as explained above to the bar staff taking my drink to table.   The best of the staff were the ladies that worked the breakfast shifts who got my breakfast with me (it was self service) and brought it to my table.   One even came up and gave me  a chocolate muffin for later.    Edit:  I just wanted to add that I complained to Hilton about the parking charge, via an email address I got from their twitter, and they are sending me a cheque to refund the parking charge."
2377,"Fully adapted wetroom and toilet, plus a separate toilet with grab rails, handles etc. Loads of room and very well thought out."
2378,Over all the access is very good from both entrances to the building which is only a few years old. If you enter via the front of the building the lifts are on the left hand side past the reception desk .  The lifts are modern and while you will get a wheelchair in to them you might struggle with a mobility scoter unless it is the small fold up type.
2379,The access for this venue is good in that it is all on one level and there are no steps. The spaces are generally open with good room to manoeuvre. There didn’t appear to be any steps. 
2380,"The staff were very helpful when my husband went in to book a table, making sure that the one they allocated would be suitable. The waitress was especially careful checking food would suit my allergies."
2381,Getting into the Resource Centre was through an automated door where you press a button to gain access. Once inside there's a lowered reception counter which was good. No resting your chin on the counter here!   The corridors were wide and clearly defined and easy to negotiate using my powerchair. All areas I visited were accessible and where there were doors these were easy to manage.
2382,On street parking available and free for blue badge holders. Plenty of spaces in front of the cafe and in the surounding area.
2383,"When travelling by car, the car park has many spaces with a couple of disabled parking spaces close to the entrance. The car park is all flat making it very easy to access the entrance. The bus stop is close by the pub, however the venue is located on a busy main access road into York and therefore crossing to return back into York can be challenging and would require someone to have good road safety. "
2384,There were two spacious accessible and clean toilets. 
2385,"This Leisure Centre has an accessible swimming pool, accessible gym and accessible games hall.  "
2386,"The coffee shop is accessed via the New Look clothing store and a lift. Access is pretty good although anybody unable to press the lift button may have to wait a bit for assistance, however there always seems to be somebody around. There is lots of space in the lift and the coffee shop itself. I could easily turn in my powerchair between tables and in front of the counter. The decor is nice and the acoustics are really good for a coffee shop making it easy for me to chat with my P.A. All of this created a calm and inviting atmosphere. The only downside for me was the toilet and the staff, who were friendly enough but did not offer any assistance. This may have been due to their lack of experience."
2387,"Staff very friendly and helpful,nothing seemed to be be too much trouble to them."
2388,"On arrival we asked at cash desk if it was accessible, we was told yes but they were unsure if tractor ride was. First problem we had was gravel uneven path, Dylan who is strong manual chair user needed help from me. Next stop was food at kernel kitchen situated outside. Couldn't access the order area as step up. We left Dylan at bottom and ordered food. The seating was all picnic benches which we couldn't get wheelchair under. We then tackled some mazes, all accessible. Then to major disappointment Dylan couldn't access any of all the other lovely stuff. Remote control boats, mural painting, maze of confusion, tractor ride etc as they all needed accessing via wooden stepped platform. None had ramps. Due Dylan being very upset we ended up leaving after 1hr 45 mins there and spending £39.50 to get in. That cost was for 1adult & 2 kids."
2389,"Staff were fantastic, encouraging, friendly and all seemed to have and a good understanding of ASN. 5*"
2390,Went for a hot chocolate around 11:30am when it wasn’t too busy. For someone in a wheelchair the doors are push or pull making it difficult for them to open it on their own. There is a disabled toilet but there isn’t a very clear path for them to get to it due to tables and chairs blocking the path. Although the coffee shop is all one level and has accessible tables inside and out and has disabled parking at the door. 
2391,"I was impressed by the access and the helpfulness of the staff when I raised a couple of small issues that would make the experience even better for wheelchair users. The entrance doors were automated and and I had the option to use one of two available platform lifts to get up to the main public level of the building. Getting around the exhibition space was easy and I could see and enjoy the displays. The cafe area was easily accessible, as was the shop, the information desk, and the Reader Registration desk."
2392,Superb service from the staff. As we would have difficulty going up to order and managing the self service drinks machine staff quickly provided table service. Checking during the course of the meal to make sure we were OK. Couldn't have been more attentive!
2393,"The accessible toilet near the reception was well signposted, fairly spacious and more than adequate."
2394,Good smooth surfaces and wide paths but very uphill.
2395,We arrived by car. We found the cottage easily using google maps and there was parking right outside the front door for 2-3 vehicles.
2396,"We drove to the area because we were going to look in a few different shops around Mono. We managed to get on street parking behind the strip of shops, but it was quite busy. There are good transport links though, as it is in the city centre."
2397,Access to the Premier was generally good. If you are visiting the ExCel Centre it's a great spot being only a short walk from Prince Regent DLR and the Centre.
2398,"Lots of staff and very well in tune with people who were disabled or requiring assistance, the bus to Glasgow had a drop level floor and a lady staff member provided a customer in her wheelchair with attendance and accessing the bus, this was reciprocated at Buchanan Street in Glasgow."
2399,"level access , automatic doors , wide foyer , no doors into the public areas , including the restaurant. Ample lifts with good space inside so no problems for wheel chairs getting to all floors. The accessible bedroom I stayed in had a working automatic door which enabled easy departure from the room and unlike most hotels with automatic doors , the mechanism was in good working order. The only issue was that the door was only automatic from inside the room , not on entry and overcoming the inertia  to push the door open was difficult. Getting out was a breeze Roomy entrance to bathroom and plenty of space for transfers both in bathroom and bedroom."
2400,"Beautifully, ornately decorated 17th century church with statues, which is well worth visiting. "
2401,Lots of seating around the centres as well as several coffee shops to stop in for a break. Ramps/lifts/escalators are available for every set of steps. Not every store had braille for signs etc.
2402,"The botanic's in Edinburgh is a joy to visit, inside it is modern and accessible, outside it is beautiful and even in a wheelchair I can appreciate a visit all that is on show."
2403,"Just over 3 miles from Droitwich town, with an easy to find route, a huge car park is available, with many disabled bays for you."
2404,The cinema is situated in a entertainment complex so has a big car park with multiple disabled parking spots but there is 18 disabled parking spaces in front of the cinema to make accessibility easier.  The foot paths are also flat and wide to allow easy wheelchair use.
2405,"Accessible toilet which was easy to find. Had fold-down rail to left of toilet (when on toilet) and fixed rail on wall on right. Flush for the toilet seemed fairly high up if trying to reach it from sitting in a wheelchair.   Toilet clean and functional, but whole area just made of concrete blocks so wasn't the most attractive. A mirror would also be good to have. "
2406,"When I visited I got dropped off so didn’t properly park in the car park but, from what I could see there weren’t any lines on the ground to mark out the parking spaces. I think people just parked in a uniformed fashion therefore, there aren’t any accessible parking spaces. The car park is surfaced in gravel stones and I can imagine it might be difficult for wheelchair users to drive on however, there is a wheelchair drop off area at the front of Cairn O’Mohr on the concrete pathway to make things easier.  I’m not from this area so, I can’t comment on any of the public transport."
2407,Parking in the car park alongside the railway line and opposite the bus station. This is a short distance from the Railway carpark. Access to the fully tarmac path is across the gated railway line and is easy enough. There are at the time of writing two disabled spaces. 
2408,"Although the front is level access, you need to go in the rear entrance because there are stairs to get everywhere from the front and the lift and accessible toilet are in the back. The staff have a temporary ramp that they put out when you ring the doorbell. The lift is tiny and a manual wheelchair could just about fit in but on my power wheelchair I need to take the footplates of in order to fit in."
2409,Mostly helpful and if you've pre booked assistance to board or alight a train the help is provided. If you haven't booked there's a member of staff around before each train departs and staff in the train who can help when alighting. Generally lots of staff around if you have any questions. 
2410,There are 2 accessible toilets one on the ground floor and one upstairs beside the gymnasium. Both toilets are small but have handrails 
2411,"Easiest boarding and travelling ever! When you get a ferry to Cumbrae (from Largs) you automatically gte sold a return ticket. This makes it easier for the return trip home! Calling Cumbrae Ferry Terminal a 'terminal' is probably a bit misleading - it's a parking area with a sign and you wait for the ferry to come in, cars and passengers to disembark, and then you roll on - simple!"
2412,Corfu has one airport. When I visited in April it was just before the start of the Greek holiday season. The airport was still being renovated and I was told a German company had taken it over. I had a bad experience but hopefully this was an out of season travel blip. However I was not impressed with the special assistance service. 
2413,Plenty of parking at the venue
2414,"Can't comment on the parking. Nearby Place Gambetta is extensively served by wheelchair accessible buses.  The cemetery is best entered by wheelchair at the gate at the end of Avenue du Père Lachaise, a short wheel or walk from Place Gambetta.  "
2415,We used a taxi from Abu Dhabi. Taxis good value and easily available. On the whole drivers helpful.
2416,5 if you have a car as you can park right outside. There is a bus stop nearby and we saw the bus zipping around the island but not sure if it's accessible or how often it runs.
2417,There are only disabled loos beyond the ticket barriers. 
2418,"The stewards were polite and helpful, indicating where we had to go immediately and in the stadium they held back people over-enthusiastically celebrating, which you cannot always guarantee. All in all people were helpful."
2419,"A fantastic parkland with a zoo, play area, golf course and a huge area of open area and is surprisingly accessible."
2420,"Very pleasant very helpful, very informative of the area"
2421,There were two large toilet cubicles accessible from the restaurant. One was slightly larger than the other with an outward opening door. There were no grab rails and it would have been a very tight squeeze for a carer. 
2422,Incredibly helpful. From showing us where to park to driving us to the top - I can't fault them - brilliant!
2423,"The premises entrance was sloped and so getting the wheelchair up and into the building was relatively easy. The door is a push from the outside which could cause issues if a wheelchair user is alone, although the staff are quick to come and help. The counter to order from was a little too high for wheelchair users and so can make them feel spoken down to. Level access around the ground floor of the building with plenty of spaces to sit suitable for a wheelchair user and the people who accompany them. Could easily access the condiments bar in the wheelchair with minimal effort required."
2424,Access to Costa Coffee is via the main door of the Next store there are stairs to the left as you enter. The lift is on the right hand side of the Next store. The lift is the type that you need to hold the button down to go up or down. The door opens and closes automatically when you exit the lift you are in the Costa Coffee next to the counter to be served.
2425,The sailing school provide free parking at the harbour although there is no specified disabled space  
2426,"99% accessible, the only place some people couldn't go was the Mary Queen of Scots bed chamber, but there was a virtual tour instead.  The Queen's Gallery was super easy, the Palace a little more complicated, but generally ok."
2427,"The hotel entrance had level access with wide automatic doors leading to reception where you will find very friendly and helpful staff. As you go in through the entrance, to the left is a good sized accessible public  toilet. Once at reception there are also self check-in machines. There are two good sized lifts that take you to all levels.  My accessible room (room 331) was on the third floor and seemed to be furthest away from the lifts and we had to negotiate approx three doors in the corridors before getting to the room. The room itself was very spacious with plenty room for getting around. The bathroom did not have a wetroom roll-in shower but had a low level bath with a shower over it. I'm unsure if this is standard in this hotel or if other rooms were fitted with wetrooms. The Lounge bar/dining area is on floor -1 in the lift and there was plenty space and staff were very helpful at moving chairs etc. At breakfast, it is a buffet style but the staff would be more than happy to assist getting it for you if required. It can get a busy at certain times but nothing to get concerned about."
2428,"Large space for parking several vehicles. Bus stop 10 minutes walk , no pavement and along a narrow country lane. Not much passing traffic. Bus service was reliable and a good service to surrounding areas. "
2429,We didn't see a disabled toilet in the hotel where the other toilets were but I wouldn't be able to use it without a hoist anyway. The toilet in the bedroom couldn't be accessed with a hoist alone because the space wasn't in the room to use it. Going into the shower/toilet room was OK but to get out was an issue unless you backed out as the hard front casters got cough in the laminate floor trim between the tiles in the shower/toilet room and the laminate floor in the bedroom.
2430,"Yes helpful but not excessively so, members of the public were useful."
2431,"Not brilliant, apart from the large taxi rank by ""The Playhouse"" next door.  Public transport is good with regular buses to nearby Princes Street & Leith Walk. (Personally, I came by taxi and my friend - who lives in Bonnyrigg, by bus.)`"
2432,"The building has several accessible toilets. All equipped and finished to a high standard.   However, for us the crowning glory was the discovery of a Changing Places Toilet. Handily tucked away at the side of the tour reception hall.  Beautifully equipped and decorated to exactly the same high specification as all the other toilets. No medical looking white grab rails in this set up!"
2433,There is a ramped access at the front of the restaurant and a big conservatory which is a good place to sit if you want more space.
2434,"No designated disabled spaces that I could see. I did park further away from the play park area though as I took my dog on a long walk however, there is a car park right next to the play area and there might be disabled spaces there. There is a bus stop just outside the park, but I would recommend going by car as you would have to walk up a road to get to the park and it's quite a distance. "
2435,lots of disabled parking outside doors
2436,The entrance to the hotel is situated in its own car park with space outside the front door to drop off and pick up
2437,"The entrance to the building and café is wheelchair accessible. However, inside the café, there is a step to access the food, beverages and the billing counter. "
2438,"Staff and volunteers are exceptional, extremely helpful. Not able to manage on your own? Shopmobility offer a Companion shopping service where we can push your wheelchair or Sighted Guide for the visually impaired too. Get in touch for more details."
2439,Currently the shop isn’t open so you just roll to the door and they pass you your ice cream. Once the shop opens next week there is a tiny step into the milk bar which is easily conquered by wheelchairs. In the shop it can be a little hard to manoeuvre if it’s busy but Mary and the staff are great at keeping an eye out for anyone who might need help and giving it.
2440,Really good level access through-out. Only the aquarium couldn't be reached in a wheelchair but this was made clear from the outset. Great day for everyone.
2441,"Wide doors, not automatic but a member of staff came as soon as I tried to open the door. Room to get round in a chair but easily accessible tables at the door and by the bar. The chairs have arms which is important for me to help me transfer. Also chairs with no arms if you prefer to slide to transfer. "
2442,"We visited here as a family of 3, we booked seats in the Everton family enclosure as away supporters. Although we didn't book disabled access seats I arrived in my wheelchair and asked to store the chair. They agreed and were very helpful. Also showed us to our seats. Great seats for anyone struggling to walk distances."
2443,You would need to get a train and walk or use the parking facilities that are a two minute walk away
2444,Attentive efficient friendly
2445,This hotel advertises itself to be wheelchair friendly. This was not the case. The lift to the bedrooms was miniscule. I really struggled to even get in. The room was so small that I could not get past the bottom of the bed. It was impossible for us to stay. The staff were lovely. We were given a complimentary drink ( and a bowl of soup) because we had been travelling all day. We were also given a full refund without any quibble. It would pay to take measurements before booking.
2446,Plenty of space in wet room for wheelchair or showerchair and carer
2447,Free disabled parking 25 metres from museum. Disabled drop off. Level access from car park.
2448,Very smart accessible loo! If the bar is busy it is a little trickier to get to with how some of the seating is arranged but this is just a small thing.
2449,Quick visit to ASDA in Newmains during the lockdown. Social distancing measures were in place and it felt quite safe.
2450,Accessible toilet down corridor- slightly impeded by a table that obstructed the corridor. If using wheelchair this would need to be moved. Toilet accessed via double door. Appropriate grab rails available in the toilet with call bell also. Toilet clean and tidy with appropriate room to manoeuvre wheelchair around or for a carer to assist. 
2451,"Some on street tables under heated awning, with table service; very steep ramp into the main part of the restaurant - access up and down the ramp definitely needing heavy shove and assistance from helpers"
2452,The store was level access from the St. Enoch Centre with an open plan frontage. Once in the store there was plenty of space for us as powerchair users to easily browse around without fear of demolishing the displays (not unheard of in our case)!  Everything was easy to see and well arranged.
2453,"There is a multi-storey car park directly opposite the school, and just beside that is an underground station (shields road).  Buses also are in this area, but we didn't use them."
2454,There are lots of toilets through out the centre which are accessible.
2455,"On the sea front by the old West Pier, the i360 offers a ride in a pod to a height of 450 feet. Disabled friendly with no steps & a lift from street level to the promenade (a useful facility even if not riding the i360).  Very spacious taking two wheelchairs on each ride, with plenty of room to move around, particularly when quiet. The visitors area has a disabled toilet & the adjacent restaurant is equally disabled friendly. Carers travel free, but can only be booked by phone or on the day. "
2456,Usually excellent.  We once had a problem with one staff member's attitude but complained to the management who were really good about it (that member of staff turned out to be only temporary anyway).
2457,Staff friendly and helpful. Helped with platform lift between shop and ground floors. Normal lift to other floors.
2458,We parked in The Swan Hotel where we were staying so there was no problem. 
2459,The  disabled access toilet is conveniently situated by the stalls. 
2460,"All staff very friendly and approachable ., will help with anything you need"
2461,"a Gravel drive from the road to the 'Lodge', with hard and level paving to designated disabled parking bay"
2462,It was accessible with a lift access.   But the small windows upstairs are all a bit high.
2463,I have always arrived via public transport. Taxi's can stop right outside the building and there is a bus stop just a minute away from the building.
2464,"Toilet facilities are clearly delineated, with the disabled toilets having good accessibility and room inside if you need someone with you."
2465,This is a good size café located with in one of the stands and is near to the ticket collection point and is very easy to find the café offers a wide range of food and drinks and is open even on non match days which is when we visited.  The café has a range of styles of seating including booths but mostly made up of table with dinning room chairs to allow a wheelchair to access the space. The lighting with in the  café is good and there are large screens showing sky sports news the sound is however off.  While it was not that busy during our visit they do recommend you book a table if there is a match on which is understandable due to numbers 
2466,The Store sits at the Corner of Graham St and Broomknoll St and as a result is on a hill.  There are 3 steps at the front door and the door into the shop opens out the way towards the steps.  As you go in to the store you are at one end of the counter. There is a small seating area across from the service counter that takes about 6 people the rest of the seating is up around 12 steps there is a double hand rail on the stairs.
2467,Very attentive & listen to you.
2468,"First of all, check the website for instructions on how to find 3B and get in. And don't worry - it's not nearly as complicated as it sounds! There are signs to keep you right. Once you get through the first gate (catch is at shoulder height when you're seated) you continue round the corner. Looks wide enough for a wheelchair. Then there's a ramp up a couple of feet featuring a tight 90 degree turn. I can do it on my (wee) scooter, but not sure a wheelchair user would be able to make the turn. Then you ring the bell for your therapist and they will come and open the door. Once inside, all three therapy rooms are on the level, with reasonable room to manouevre and furniture that can be shoved out of your way."
2469,The Air Museum is wheelchair accessible throughout including wide single doors. There is an accessible toilet located in the toilet block. There is an onsite restaurant which is accessible also- serving some lovely food!!
2470,The staff couldn't be nicer and more helpful if they tried...
2471,Access is very easy but wheelchair users need to go through the Leisure club and then take the lift to the First floor to access the restaurant through the Grill room.I was assured that this is the way that celebrities come in to avoid publicity.
2472,"I travelled by wheelchair taxi, dropping off point outside venue, on a very busy main road.Street parking available, the nearest dedicated disabled parking space I observed was at the public library around the corner. Venue is on public bus route"
2473,Entrance via cloisters for wheelchair users with ramp into the abbey also ramp into café and shop area within the abbey
2474,Just used toilet in my room (with grab rails and plenty of room) and didn't notice any others. 
2475,There are no steps from the car park to the main entrance. The gym is on the same level as the reception. There are lifts from the gym down to the changing rooms.
2476,"6 steps into the building at 9 Howe Street, no means of alerting staff of need for assistance unless you can get up the steps (or if you have can use a mobile phone and already know the phone number).  Main toilet includes 2 cubicles, of which 1 has grab rails.  More individual cubicles down a flight of stairs, but lighting is variable.  Garden can be reached via cobbled street and one step, but no toilet facilities.  Activities sometimes held at wheelchair accessible venues around the city, but acoustics can result in too much noise (writing as someone who can become distressed by noise and other sensory stimulation)."
2477,Amazing - this is how things should be done!
2478,"Access in and around the building  The hotel was easy to find as it is well signposted and sites on a prominent corner site. The entrance has wide automated doors and there are not ramps or obstacles to negotiate. I was able to roll straight in with my powerchair.  Once inside the reception was to the left hand side of the entrance. There was a dropped section of the reception counter which was good for me.  Moving around further and there was a bar and lounge area. Going further on you came to the restaurant. Easy to get in with furniture that was easily moveable to allow for good wheelchair access.  To get to the accessible room I had to go up in the lift. There were two lifts and they were spacious. The door clearance was 81 cm and the depth of the lift was 146 cm. The buttons were easy to reach and clear to use. Once upstairs the corridor was a standard style as you see in all Premier inns with carpeted flooring and the occasional fire door to negotiate. The clearance of the fire doors was the narrowest part of my journey and were only 77 cm clearance for my wheelchair.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms  The accessible bedroom had wide door access with a clearance width of 87 cm. Once in the room there was plenty of space to wheel in, move around and get alongside the bed.  The bathroom was accessible and included a bath not a wet room. There were plenty of grab handles and it was well laid out. Obviously, not suited to everyone having just a bath. It was spacious enough for me to be able to wheel and turn a full 360-degree circle. There was a transfer space to the right of the toilet (as you look toward it).  There were lamps and light switches by the bedside. Importantly for me, there was a power point to charge my powerchair.  Access in the dining area  The dining area was easy to find and easy for me to get in to as you simply wheel in to the area. The tables and chairs are moveable so it was easy for me to find a spot that suited my powerchair."
2479,"The venue itself is a massive tent! There was a small entrance and then through another set of material ""doors"" and you're into the main space. There were chairs arranged but the staff were able to help us move them to get all of us accommodated. The most annoying bit of whole experience was before we even got to venue when we had to walk half way back down George Street to pick up our tickets as we couldn't pick them up from box office on site."
2480,I travelled there and back by taxi. The cab dropped me off outside the Royal Festival Hall on Belvedere Road. Where I was dropped off I had to walk across a wide paved area to reach the building. 
2481,"Kerb free access to the beach from the parking spaces. Whilst it was a warm, overcast day, there were still plenty of spaces at 11am. These had mainly gone by the afternoon when the sun had come out."
2482,"All the loos equipped the same and uniform size for wheelchairs and Carers, "
2483,Accessible loo is located outside a short distance away from the Hall.
2484,Las Piedras provides wheelchair adapted transport in it's own vehicles.
2485,I travelled to the Cutty Sark by boat and from Greenwich Pier there was a step free route to the ship. The nearest station is Cutty Sark on the Docklands Light Railway 9DLR) which has step free access.
2486,We went to see the RSNO who were brilliant but the staff made the night. I use a sporty scarlet rollator to get about short distances. One entering the Concert Hall and thinking about the stairs one of the staff directed me to a wee lift which took my husband and I up to the main floor. He then offered to help us to our seats. Now the fun began. Last time I'd been here I'd been fully mobile and John was worried the seats I'd chosen were too difficult to get to. He offered to help find something more appropriate. 5 minutes later and guided all the way we were handed over to even more helpful staff and shown to seats at the back of the auditorium at stalls level. My new  rollator folds closed and was able to stay at the side of my seat but the lady would have kept it safely for me if I'd needed to. As I said the RSNO are brilliant but the way the staff went out there way to help me. Without making a fuss and causing embarrassment were the memorable part. We are going again this month. hopefully following their advice and sitting in an area I can reach without causing too much bother.
2487,Large car park
2488,good accessibility and decent food for your money
2489,"Lift takes you up to the venue, so no problem there. "
2490,"Nearby parking at Castle Terrace, good bus links on Lothian Road, and a taxi drop off point outside the building. There are dropped kerbs and wide pavements on the approach to CodeBase."
2491,"To get to the ruins we had to travel along pavements and roadside path. Once in the site! The path was a good surface and mostly level. The steepest section was the first bit but was managed unaided. The paths inside the ruin were compacted earth - mostly firm and a bit uneven by the gate (help needed). Down to the river was a mixture of track and grass.  Up to the church and the gate at point 7 on the map (see photo), was a surfaced path but the last few yards were steepish, again needing help. The church was very accessible with plenty of turning space."
2492,Staff are generally helpful. Each of the accessible viewing areas have designated staff to assist.
2493,The complex and venue car park are all access friendly so no complaints
2494,This is our 2nd stay at Summerfield Holiday Cottages in Scoreby Cottage.  There are 4 properties and the owners Jayne and Richard and live on site.  Nothing is too much trouble and my wife who is chair bound and I really love the location
2495,Several bus routes will drop you off nearby but there are no step-free stations in the vicinity.
2496,La Goccia is part of the Petersham Nursery group which has two restaurants and a bar located together in Covent Garden. You access the restaurant through a courtyard and entry to the restaurant itself is flat which is very unusual for Covent Garden. We went for Sunday lunch in December so the restaurant was busy but the staff kindly swopped our table to a more suitable one which allowed me to get my knees under the table (lifting the better table to a more spacious location for my wheelchair). The disabled loo was on the ground floor which is again quite unusual for Covent Garden. The loo was messy (see photo) as there were no hand towels but clean and it was tucked into the corner so other people were not aware of its location so it was free whenever I wanted to use it. Staff were very friendly and our waiter even bought us 4 different wines to try before we ordered. Very relaxed atmosphere for a pre theatre meal.
2497,"Easy entry into hotel, on the level with an automatic sliding door. A lift is available, reasonable size, so you would cope. Nice seating by reception if tired and needing a drink."
2498,There was a woman that was amazing
2499,"very easy to get around, although the lifts are a bit of a squeeze for chairs, had to send one person up or down at a time."
2500,One loop and it wasn't working. Signage for loop is poor.
2501,"Wow, firstly I never knew you could put lifts in a canal boat, I wasn't sure how we got on an it made things so much easier. a toilet big enough for a wheelchair too, plus there is still plenty of space to move around.  The crew were wonderful, nothing was too much trouble, they were such a good laugh and really made the day fun, they were a font of knowledge about the canal and the boats too.  I really can't wait for a return trip."
2502,The Majority of the building is accessible for disabled users with several lifts in place. The building can be a bit confusing so keep an eye out for the directional signposts. Our tip for a group visit would be to contact the centre first and arrange your visit with the very capable staff! 
2503,"Last minute booking for a Saturday night and we were allocated room 6 on the ground floor with 100% accessibility.  Excellent room with plenty of space to manoeuvre my mobility scooter   2 single beds with great wet room shower., bar, restaurant, and fully inclusive cooked/continental breakfast, or a takeaway breakfast box if in a hurry.  Plenty disabled parking bays, level access throughout.  Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for some idiot in the next room having a loud mobile phone communication at nearly midnight.   Staff were very friendly and supplied extra pillows no bother at all.  All for £62.  What's not to like? "
2504,Francis was our tour guide and she was very friendly and knowledgeable. She was patient and explained everything in good detail. 
2505,Staff were wonderful - really friendly and welcoming.
2506,"It was in the ladies toilet area, so I did not use it"
2507,A mix.  Individual security staff were very helpful.  But other staff were willfully ignorant.  
2508,I’ve been going each year with my family for over 10 years 
2509,"Clean and tidy, fully accessible, roomy loo. Easy to find not far from entrance."
2510,Staff generally helpful and friendly.
2511,only one toilet but was clean and had many ramps and much space.
2512,"Sadly, we found this rather wheelchair unfriendly, steps needed even to get down to see the pool and gym, so of no use to us disabled. However, the Spa facilities have a nice swimming pool, busy, heated loungers, and a steam room. The Gym has a number of latest equipment, and will receive an upgrade as part of a multi-million investment across 18 health clubs.  They seem to be concentrating their efforts on the Elemis skin and care treatments, which includes Well being massage, hot stone massage, Frangipani body wraps, and also facial treatments to help renew you, a facial health check which includes a relaxing face and scalp massage, which may help you take away stress and leave your skin radiant. Ladies, you may have your manicure seen to, file and polish your hands and feet, and of course your eyebrows. Go for it gals ."
2513,"Lovely room, easily accessible throughout. Restaurant on floor 1 but access easy via lift."
2514,Accessible parking has not been covered up for queues. I was able to park right next to the door.
2515,Has large car-park with at least two spaces for disabled. Rather remote site so little in way of public transport.
2516,There was plenty toilets 
2517,Everywhere on the disabled stand is assessable all level with slopes for access and lifts to access level 1 and 2.
2518,They are there but I didn't use them.
2519,"Very flat and wheelchair accessible, large open restaurant.  Plenty to look at and a lovely calm environment  Thank you for good entrance price for carer and wheelchair user "
2520,Lots of blue badge spaces on level 1 and 2 of the car park and the lift is usually pretty quick as there are escalators for everyone else.
2521,"There is step-free access into the restaurant through a set of double doors which were propped open with hooks for us as we entered. Staff saw us coming straight away thanks to the glass windows in the doors. Once inside, the tables are well spaced apart and the floors smooth and wooden. We were shown to our large table at the back of the restaurant which was accessed via a long ramp. Some fixed bench seating, but mostly movable furniture which was helpful for us and our large party! "
2522,"The loo was very high. It had a drop-down rail to one side and a fixed rail on the other. Grab rails in the wet-room shower area and a freestanding but good and solid shower seat. Shower was rather high, even on it's lowest setting."
2523,"Mostly access to get round the park is good, there are wide paved paths the whole way round. Some of the hill/ramp areas may prove a little steep if self-propelling a manual chair.  A couple of the paths are a little worn, but this may be about to be fixed.  Although previously some accessible play equipment had been installed in the children's play park, you had to go across grass to reach this, which unfortunately made it more difficult for some to reach.  The play areas are one of things getting changed in the re-generation, so this is the perfect opportunity for them to be made even more accessible."
2524,There are at least 3 ways in to the bus station 2 from the shopping area and one from the train station  side these were all level access areas.  Off course because of the nature of the venue it is going to be a busy place at certain times of the day.
2525,"The promenade is clean, flat and well surfaced. There were plenty of entry points to the beach, both slips and steps. Most of the prom is away from the roads so no cars to worry about, and nice for walking the dog. When you get to the end of the prom, you can turn left and follow a path uphill to Roker Park. It looked nice from the road but we didn't go that far."
2526,"Excellent access from the Balgreen end. No intermediate access points for wheelchair users. Sound access at the Corstorphine end, though whoever developed the Paddockholm estate on the site of Corstorphine Station hadn't heard of drop-downs."
2527,Fully accessible all areas.
2528,"Parking was quite easy with free disabled parking, very close to the shops on High street, Knowle. Payments were reasonable, slopes onto Main Street quite easy enough to handle, and it’s only a short distance anyway."
2529,"There are 2 entrances to enter Brechin Castle Garden Centre, the main one where you can enter or exit the gift shop area and they’ve opened another entrance through the back of the garden plant area which I think they have opened to reduce crowds during the pandemic. Each entrance is level access but I felt the ground was a little bumpy whilst going around the back near the garden plants.  Outside in the garden section I found the width of the aisles to be okay for my wheelchair however, inside in certain areas the aisles were quite difficult to get around. Especially in one section where more fragile items were on sale including candle holders, lanterns and vases. I didn’t buy anything whilst I was there so I cannot comment on the height of the tills.  I visited the café whilst at Brechin Castle Garden Centre, it was my first time eating out since the second lockdown and I was a little nervous. We sat outside though, the tables were nicely spaced out and at a good height for a wheelchair user. You have to go through the inside of the café to get outside so I noticed that the tables were also nicely spaced out inside. I can’t comment on the height of the till in the café either as my parents paid and I can’t fully remember what the height of the counters were selling cakes, but I do remember being able to see the cakes so it must have been at an alright for my wheelchair."
2530,"Cowley, recorded in the Doomsday book, simply means “cow pasture” and it stood by the river Churn, which runs past lakes in the Manor before joining the river Thames a lot further down river. A church, which stands in the grounds, was built in the 13th century, along with an old manor, both becoming the property of the Dean and chapter of Westminster, after King Henry V111 got rid of the Abbey that stood here.  In 1695 a Manor House was built, and over the years has been in the care of many tenants, until the church gave the lease over to a Mr James Hutchinson, who in 1850, using stone from the old house, built a new house on the site, now part of the present building. He then built the Victorian water garden and its cascade. The Cowley Manor we see today was the work of Sir James Horlick, (of Horlick Malt) who extended the house and laid out the grounds.  It is believed that Lewis Carroll visited the village of Cowley quite often, using the grounds as part of his Alice in wonderland story. If this is so, then maybe that’s why the hotel as we see it today, is regarded as being rather quirky and different, it’s certainly is so as you look around. After the Second World War, the property fell into disrepair, and remained so until bought in 1999 by Peter and Jessica Frankopan, who then restored the manor. This was the first of their four hotels they own as part of “A curious group of Hotels” and a different hotel it looks , with 31 bedrooms standing in 55 acres of grounds with grade 11 gardens.  OUR REVIEW OF COWLEY MANOR. Situated in the hamlet of Cowley, which holds a few houses of typical warm Cotswold yellow stones along its winding lane, your journey here will begin when you arrive at a picturesque tree lined impressive gateway and drive, (photo 1) with many species of trees from around the world, and moving along, over to your left, you pass the first of the small lakes, Lodge lake (photo 2) and the river Churn, leading ahead to the next lake, the Boat house lake, with its bank of well tended grassy slopes (3) before turning a corner to arrive at the old Cowley Manor (4).  Towards the front entrance (5) you pass the car park, and just two disabled bays in the corner, and then you have a small step to get up before you can enter the hotel.  We were greeted at a highly unusual reception area, (6) which would thereafter highlight the quirky hotel we were about to see, and this led us into a very shall we say, more modern and different bar area, colourful to say the least (7). We found it difficult to describe the main lounge (8),  bare, yet holding its own character, but we did enjoy a very nice cup of coffee (9).  Beyond, a pleasant wooden staircase and hallway (10) guided the way into what we assumed was the library (11) and then a games room (12). The last room past the reception, we enter the breakfast room (13) with pale Ash wood panels, which provides a continental breakfast included in the cost of your room, but you pay extra for any type of hot meal you would like. Now we don’t know why it’s a popular hotel, we are working on that, but it was certainly well booked, and although we requested a few days before if we could join them for breakfast, they sadly had to decline our request because of being so full at that time of the week.  If the weather holds promise on your day here, you may wish to enjoy breakfast on the small terrace area, (14) overlooking the third of the lakes, still fed by the river Churn, known as Upper lake, home to a few ducks. Now this is a very dog friendly hotel, your canine friends may join you wherever you  want, and there were certainly a lot of well behaved owners guiding their pets around the grounds, and actually this was nice to see, for it is a delightful park to walk around.  The only way a disabled person could get around the grounds, was to leave by the reception area, and down that small step, and the first building you see is the old Anglican St Mary’s church of the 1200,s restored in 1872, (15) with dressed limestone, Ashlar Cotswold stone tower and chancel, with a stone slate roof, now a  grade 11 historical building.  Across from the car park is the level compressed path for the gardens, (16) lined with  many decorative trees and shrubs, leading down to the third pool, (17) which is held back by the impressive wall of the decorative carved frontage of the cascade below, and  gratefully, in use today (18) running on down into a small pool (19) before reaching the pool beyond, and from up here, we had our last view of the unusual and quirky Cowley Manor (20).  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS. What can we say, other than different, glad to have seen the hotel and grounds, but it’s not for us, but it has its supporters, so don’t mock it, but we are pleased to say that it is at least a very dog friendly hotel, and it’s welcoming, and many families were enjoying with their canine friends the hospitality and freedom to roam and run. If you are into a different style of furnishing then you will enjoy your stay, ( do take a look at the many websites offering room deals here so as to note the way each room is furnished ) but it is wonderfully landscaped with long walks available.    Different !"
2531,The young staff were very welcoming and eager to help.
2532,The stewards were very helpful but not all of them were knowledgeable about the stadium. A young man took us to the away stand and let us in through a gate but informed the man scanning the tickets that we were in the side stand. A few stewards then came and found us to tell us we were in the stand behind the goal. Another young steward led us to the stand behind the goal but we had to push through the fans waiting outside to get to our seats.
2533,Disabled drop off area at airport good with 10+ spaces.
2534,All paths are level and accessible. Toilets are great and they have a changing room/toilet which is so rare at places. Really makes visits easier. 
2535,"Getting along the pavement from the end of Waverley Bridge a bit chaotic, but once at the door, great."
2536,Great disabled toilet - I left a Euans guide card
2537,"Easy access for wheelchairs. Didn't appear to have spaces for wheelchairs, placed at end of aisle"
2538,"This is based down Gunwharf Portsmouth, they have a few rows of disabled bays which are very wide so enough room to get any aids out and set up. They have a couple of lifts to the car park. They are next to a train station and a bus depot for those who travel via public transport. The access from and to all these sites is good, with newly paved areas including nice ramps. "
2539,I found the access during my visit to be very good. The lifts were large enough for my powerchair. The room very spacious with a good sized wet room. Visiting the be and restaurant areas there was enough space to easily move around. The tables and chairs could be moved to accommodate my wheelchair. Access in and out of the Premier to the adjoining shopping centre (Westfield Stratford) was easy.
2540,Very accomodating - Excellent
2541,"The staff are very friendly , chatty and helpful. "
2542,All good. Modern. No issues. Good rails and stuff for balance
2543,Never used the facilities. 
2544,Parking is no more than 12 foot from the front door
2545,"Lovely owner, great welcome pack with superb bread and beer. Superb easy access shower wet room for easy washing. Level access at rear to a wonderful Indian restaurant and the rest of the high street.  The owner looked after our greyhound for a day so we got to Kelso races. "
2546,Had a fantastic week staying in Cardy cottage. Have stayed a few times before. First visit since COVID restrictions eased.  The accommodation was pristine. Family members visited for a short stay and had a great time with quick access to the beach for grandchildren. Lovely helpful staff. Looking forward to returning in August. 
2547,As previously described this is one of the best disab!we toilets
2548,"I travelled by public transport. The nearest tube is Piccadilly Circus or Charing Cross, which both have poor disabled access. There are many buses that stop near by, in Piccadilly or Trafalgar Square, and then it is a few minutes walk. I travelled to Trafalgar Square on the bus and then it was a flat 5 - 10 minute walk to the Royal Society, and I think this may be the best option for people with mobility difficulties, as Piccadilly is up/ down a hill."
2549,Accessible parking was available near the gate. It might be better to use taxis or a shuttle bus though as these stop directly outside the gate.
2550,"We started our ride - and hence this review is written from that point of view - from N Greenwich and went over to Emirates Royal Docks.  Due to the location, you need to take public transport. I know that North Greenwich tube is nearby (it's very near the O2).. We arrived by river and it was a leisurely two to three minute stroll/push from North Greenwich pier. Easy level route which was very well signposted. Over the other side of the river, we walked a short distance to Royal Victoria tube, which is on the DLR. It was all quite easy and well signed."
2551,"Plenty of signs showing directions and other entrance information. Steps leading up to the minster however there was also a ramp outside. Lots of staff located around the entrance available for assistance however less staff available once through the minster. Big spacious walk ways, however some smaller pathways, which may be less accessable, leading off into side attractions."
2552,"The experience I had of Gatwick airport and its staff was a high excellent level of care. I was treated exceptionally well. I had warned both the airport and  airline that I had extra medical supplies (I am fed by TPN which is a bag of food into my vein. I was treated so well, I would say first class. In customs I had no difficulties as I had a doctors letter clearly explaining my needs for fluids and sharps. I honestly feel if you prepare yourself the best you can then it helps, but I was still overwhelmed by the compassion and kindness shown to me."
2553,there is enough space allocated for disabled people but when the car park states its full you cant get in to see if the disabled parking is availible
2554,Easy access to the bedrooms from the carpark but not so easy to get into the bar area.  There is one step from the bedrooms part into the bar area which makes it very awkward for wheelchair users.  This is a very old building and even the front entrance into the bar area has steps so unless you are with someone or unless some of the bar staff can assist there is no access to wheelchair users or people who find steps difficult.  The staff though were extremely helpful and did offer assistance at all times.
2555,"Disabled toilet provided meeting Changing Places criteria. Access by RADAR key, available from staff. "
2556,"No dedicated car park, but several disabled parking bays are available in the area. The bus stops are close by, and it is extremely close to the train station."
2557,"The lady was polite to all of us in the group. The lady gave us a simple ‘goodbye’ when we were leaving Brunch and Brew. I really like Brunch and Brew and will defiantly be returning. The lady made eye contact with who she was speaking too, she was friendly.  "
2558,"The staff are exceptionally highly-strung - one of them followed me round the whole time, afraid I might fall and break something - and their attitude to disability seems to be stuck somewhere in the 1970s. They are friendly when it comes to talking about the history of the house and its objects and the garden, for this they get half a star. For disability-awareness, zero."
2559,Staff were friendly and looked like they were having a great time!
2560,Closomat toilet with tracking hoist if required.
2561,"Suprisingly, this coastal landscape is very accessible although the grassy areas might be less so in a wet winter. Obviously the causeway to the island is not accessible but the views from the mainland are quite sufficient."
2562,Accessible bathroom with plenty of room to manoeuvre in a manual wheelchair. Grab rails and shower seat all ideally positioned. 
2563,Friendly and welcoming.
2564,"Most staff are friendly and helpful. Some are grumpy but get on with being helpful all the same. One member of staff is relentlessly gloomy and pessimistic, and will *not* get your day off to a bright and cheerful start."
2565,"Spacious and clean, but no full changing station."
2566,Two disabled parking spaces. Near the access ramp.
2567,"There are accessible toilets within this venue designated for public use but the bogs are not for the sole use of disabled people. Signage on or near the toilet doors - good if you are a space invader - the toilet is about 7m located on the right as you enter. There is, of course, level access to the accessible toilet."
2568,The bloke at the front door directed my taxi driver round to the back of the building and came to meet us at what he called the 'VIP entrance' - I was glad I'd dressed up! The road sloped down to this door (double width) and then he pointed me to the lift just inside the door. Quite a cosy lift but luckily you drive in and out in the same direction - so no three point turn needed. Up two floors and he met me when I drove out of the lift and handed me over to a colleague who took me to my table.
2569,"I passed a large accessible loo on the landing of the stairs. However due to its location, it is not particularly accessible as wheelchair users would need to use the stair lift to access it, and it wasn't the largest of stair lifts."
2570,"The City of London has it's own police force which covers the Square Mile. This fascinating, small, free museum covers the history of this police force from its creation in 1839 until the present day. It has sections on Jack the Ripper and the Houndsditch Murders. Interesting exhibits such as rattles and whistles, police boxes, to the Olympic gold medal the Police won at the 1920 Olympic Games for Tug of War. There is also a collection of old police uniforms and the opportunity for the public to try on some of the different type of police helmets. The museum is disabled accessible."
2571,The lift facilities are modern. Guides can also assist if you contact the booking office in advance. The main issue for anyone with mobility problems is the rough terrain of the stone surfaces.
2572,"Did not use, hence mid range"
2573,Public transport to nearby leaves something to be desired with the exception of the 303 bus. Recently the roads and pavements around the museum seem to have been re-tarmaced meaning it's quite a smooth journey although bit of a detour for a dropped kerb to start.
2574,"Directed by security staff, there is plenty parking round the back of the building. The security staff direct you to accessible parking that is directly by the entrance."
2575,"There is a disabled toilet at the end of the lobby that has handrails and is reasonably spacious, with plenty of room for a carer.  However,  turning on the lights and locking the door are not straightforward operations!"
2576,"There are a number of streets on the flat, and there was enough for me that was accessible for a week. However there are areas I couldn't explore which are up a flight of stairs.  Most cafes and shops have a step or two to enter but many of the cafes also have outdoor seating. There are also some churches and museums to visit in the area. Some of the roads are pedestrianised but motor bikes or delivery vehicles frequent the area. I found most of the paving smooth rather than cobbled."
2577,"St Andrews can be reached by the main roads A91, A917, and A915. The nearest railway station is Leuchars, 10.2 miles or 16km away, approximately 20 minutes by car. Accessible taxis can be booked in advance - contact Williamsons on 01334 476787. There is a regular bus service from Dundee via Leuchars station into St Andrews, Stagecoach route no.99 has low floor access, wheelchair access and Wi-Fi. All no.99 buses go to St Andrews bus station, 0.5 miles or 0.8 km from MUSA. The 99A, 99B and 99D go into the centre of St Andrews. The no.92 bus goes from St Andrews bus station to North Street, which is 0.2 miles or 0.3km from MUSA. From North Street you can walk down Butts Wynd and MUSA is opposite at the end of the lane, on The Scores. Bus timetables can be found at https://www.stagecoachbus.com/timetables.   MUSA is situated on The Scores, set back from the road, with flat, paved access on a gentle downward slope from the street to the museum entrance. Parking is free on The Scores, which is one way. There is also free parking available at the North Haugh and West Sands car parks. Paid parking spaces are available in the town centre although on street parking is free for Blue Badge holders. There is a cobbled surface at the entrance to the carpark, between the street and the carpark, although there is a level tarmac section at the archway to the left of the car park entrance.  There are two accessible parking spaces in the car park at the front of the museum and level access from the car park to the museum entrance on a paved path. The museum carpark can be used for drop off before parking in the street  We parked nearby on street on The Scores on this visit."
2578,Approximately 25 disabled spaces available
2579,There's little dedicated parking but there was space to park outside both times when we visited.  Level ground if going from parking spaces to the entrance on former station platform.
2580,They have a easy drop off point for those who have mobility issues with a covered walkway. The meet and greet parking was excellent. We stayed at the on site hotel and booked an accessible room with only one nights notice. A steep incline to get to the terminal though is the only issue.
2581,Accessible to users with wheelchairs and limited mobility
2582,"Toilets are basic, you may have to get out of your chair to use, but other facilities will be available on other parts of your day trip."
2583,Super helpful and welcoming
2584,Lift was rather small taking many attempts to get the electric wheelchair in
2585,"Visited the Falkirk wheel for the first time in a couple of years.  I generally go places myself but luckily there was someone with me today as there are automatic ticket barriers at the top of the hill entering the area.    I'm not able to reach and get the ticket, so my friend had to jump out and get the ticket, then when exiting the carpark he had to jump out again to scan the the ticket to leave.  Also there is a £3.50 charge now for parking.    Apart from this, you can access all areas on a scooter the area is flat, though there are a couple of areas that can be accessed by stairs or gradients.   The toilet was a bit cramped with the scooter in.  Also when you open the door it opens directly on to the gents toilet door!"
2586,There is ample on street parking. Paisley Rd West is a short walk and is serviced by many bus routes 
2587,Local buses stop near the gardens or taxis can drop you outside. If travelling from the sea front the gardens are on top of a steep hill.
2588,"Fantastic wheelchair accessible wine tour and tasting just 10 minutes drive outwith Dundee where you can also enjoy food in the café and buy your favourite wine bottle in the shop.  I didn’t visit the café so, I can’t comment on the accessibility of it here."
2589,Lifts and ramps readily available
2590,Overall this was a fantastic day out but I went with realistic expectations. Not everything is accessible but they have made a good attempt at most areas. The accessible bus was an absolute God-send and they prioritised this over other vehicles when coming out of lockdown.
2591,"Pigneto is a local Roman neighbourhood that is yet to be discovered by the crowds of tourists. This is because the Metro line C which will eventually connect it to the city centre is yet to be completed. If you can find the time to make it out to Pigneto, you'll be treated to this colourful market full of Lazio's best produce with Pigneto's signature graffiti and mural backdrops. The best part is, there's barely a cobblestone in sight!"
2592,I saw or saw signs to an accessible toilet but didn’t use it. We know that there was no hoist.
2593,I asked if they had an accessible toilet. They said yes but it was down a few steps. That was when they said they had a ramp but I was not keen to try that (they are always too steep) and so I went back to the motorhome and used my own.
2594,"Never had to open a door as staff are always there to help, although not intrusive. Automatic doors are very wide, ramps to all areas within the hotel. More ramps and lifts than there is steps in the complex. Private beach access meant wheelchair users could go to the waterfront. Lifts are available to all floors and staff are able to help with luggage immediately on arrival."
2595,"It's been a long time coming at the hawthorns, but I'm so pleased to say the accessibility now is topnotch. As you enter there's refreshments, then through the wheelchair accessible entrance, there's 4 clean toilets, great stewards always with  a smile, and a warm greeting. "
2596,"Not all areas are available to the disabled, to many steps, steep ramp, to much walking for carer to push you around. The only lift we saw was in the Woodlands court, which we think holds the disabled rooms, but not sure. With a little help we did see what is available."
2597,The member of staff who met us hadn’t been told we were coming however he was still very helpful and knew how to use everything.   The staff member said that he would speak to his superiors to ask for batteries and ear protectors to be ordered so that all of the equipment could be used.
2598,"The staff were very friendly during our visit and made us all feel very welcome. They were more than willing to address any queries or questions that we had and interacted well with all of our group, including a member who has a learning disability. "
2599,Very helpful 
2600,"They have a good, big toilet with grab rails but filthy and smelly."
2601,Accessible cafe with an accessible toilet within Chester Shopping Precinct. Nice choice of tea and cakes.
2602,"Not got its own parking, there is parking a few minutes walk away, and so is the bus station. "
2603,Toilets to the left as you enter the venue
2604,"Wow, a beautiful light accommodation, with sea views. Everything has been considered, a very tasteful  set up, includes many accessible considerations, without feeling at all medical. A proper home, actually better than home!   Hoists, bathrooms, profiling bed, it's all been well thought out. Even the kitchen has everything you need for cooking.    I expect this will be the first of many visits for me. "
2605,Disabled parking 300 yards from entrance.
2606,"All friendly and welcoming. Slightly let down by one volunteer, though, when I asked her if there were any more ramps that could be put out and she was flummoxed, saying she'd never come across a query like that and maybe I should just accept that this was an old place where you couldn't expect such things. Actually, it's not an old place; it's a new town made of rebuilt old buildings, and it would be perfectly feasible to put in a few dropped kerbs in keeping with the style of the site, or get more than one wooden ramp out. Blists Hill is already a lovely place - a tweak or two like this would make it even better."
2607,Only 1 space
2608,Old Hall built 1656 well worth a visit
2609,"In the cafeteria style cafe the staff were very helpful and carried our food and drink to the table, offering to move chairs to accommodate the wheel chair I was using"
2610,"There are accessible parking spaces near to the front door. Walking around near the hotel was slightly more tricky due to not many dropped kerbs so I did have to go along the road, however this was very quiet so it didn’t feel unsafe. "
2611,"No signage to find disabled toilets, only regular loos. Toilet very tight fit, no usable turn area. Couldn't get under basin due to bin.   Fixed vertical and horizontal L, drop down and fixed vertical R. Paper dispenser very high. Emergency cord white and cut off at standing height."
2612,The staff are friendly and helpful
2613,No steps leading into cafe. Non automatic door for enterance which you have to pull towards you to enter. Signage for ground floor toilet could be better (it's back left from the tills). There is an upstairs seating area which can be accessed via stairs (no lift) but there is limited seating on the ground floor. No induction loop. No alternative reading formats but quite big writing. Certain stock is high and would be out of reach for a wheelchair user (would need someone to reach for you).
2614,Staff/volunteers were helpful with doors etc and advised on accessible route.
2615,Top marks for the helpfulness and kindness of the staff.
2616,We were lucky enough to get tickets for Prime Minister's questions which was in the middle of the Brexit debates. Ask your MP for tickets.
2617,This is a country park with lots of car parking spaces. If they are full drive to the bottom of the road and there is also car parking in the pub car park too. There is parking in the entrance to the park and also further by the lake too.
2618,Plenty of parking in town and also a car park  at rear.   5 minute walk from Letchworth station.
2619,Good Access
2620,Disabled parking by door. Bus stop by car park entrance. Car park can get busy though. Slight slope but otherwise livel.
2621,Plenty of disabled parking
2622,The store had level access and wide doors which would accommodate a wheelchair. There was a disabled toilet at the back of the store and I was advised I would need to ask a member of staff for a key to access this. No hearing loop available as far as I could see.
2623,We had a great day out here. It is a beautiful place and not as crowded as Windemere which suited our group. The staff were friendly and helped us by putting ramps down so we could get on and off the boat safely. For people living with dementia this is a great excursion and no problems with accessibility.
2624,"Disabled access to the park & facities was good, but only if you were staying in a van "
2625,"The new visitor centre is fantastic! Accessible parking right outside, wide smooth pathways up to the front door which opens automatically. The centre is bright, and you are greeted with the most friendly welcome by somebody at reception. This is where you book tickets for the Kelpie tour which is itself wheelchair accessible. Inside the visitor centre there is a brilliant space which kids and adults alike will love. It has low, moveable benches in front of a video screen, fascinating illustrations all at low level, desks to play with lego and a drawing table (again at a great height for wheelchair users). The cafe inside the building has plenty of tables with removable chairs too. Just great."
2626,"Accessible unisex loo, well signposted and nice and clean. "
2627,"Transport & Parking There is a council car park right outside of Dundee Science Centre which is free for blue badge holders but other visitors  have to do pay and display, I could see about 3 or 4 disabled parking spaces. Across the road there is also Greenmarket car park which is also a council car park but is indoors and I think there are lots of parking spaces.  Dundee Science Centre is located in the city centre of Dundee so there is lots of public transport nearby. The train station is a 5 minute walk away, maybe not even that long, and there is a taxi rank here. The bus station is about a 10 minute walk away and there are also bus stops nearby which go all over the Dundee and Angus area."
2628,The staff are lovely. Very helpful.
2629,"Street parking, no designated accessible parking. Good drop off point, I got dropped off by taxi. Public bus stance a 5 minute walk away"
2630,"There are 2 ""accesssible toilets"" one in the men's and the other in the ladies toilets. To be honest they are not fit to be called accessible toilets.  I noticed a metal gate with a wheelchair user sign. The gate had to be unbolted and it was heavy. I went threw thinking it would be obvious where the accessible toilet was. When I followed this step free path it appeared to lead to a private admin block and it was not clear where to go. I think in hindsight I should have turned right at the end of the path to get to the toilets, but as it wasnt sign posted I retraced my steps.   I then followed the sign to the toilets. There was a single step to negosiate and then a short flight of stairs with a handrail on one side.  I used the accessible toilet in the ladies. The door to the ladies was open and the accessible toilet immediately in front with a wheelchair user logo on the door. the toilet itself was clean and spacious but there were NO grab rails. I nearly found myself stuck on the toilet and I found this distressing. This was unacceptable."
2631,Lots of well equipped disabled toilets.
2632,"Nice, friendly and allowed you to sample some of the casks."
2633,"Maybe not the first place you would consider for a day out but this modern ""garden centre"" provides an indoor space to do a bit of shopping, eat nice food and look at animals with the children.  We have visited using a wheelchair and elbow crutches and the main site has easy access for both. The main reason we go is to entertain the children by looking at the fish and chickens they have.  There is a slide/ climbing frame outside on rubber matting.  The outdoor plant sales area is flat and staff are usually helpful with advice on choosing plants and sometimes pushing trolleys!"
2634,Enjoyable experience and good efforts for accessibility.
2635,you'll need a car as it's up the top of a very steep hill. There is a small car park
2636,"There are multiple lifts to take people to every floor and a platform lift when you first enter the building.  I liked the mix of video, visual, written and audio materials in each exhibition. All of the exhibitions had large print guides. There were some great tactile objects in the 'Medicine Man' and the 'Being Human' exhibitions. I only spotted portable seats and digital guides at the start of the 'Medicine Man' exhibition. There are seats throughout Wellcome and I'd definitely recommend visiting the Reading Room on the second floor (interesting things to see and read and a nice mix of seating options)! The 'Play Well' exhibition had interpretation at a great hight for wheelchair users, however, I did feel that some of the items and interactive elements in the 'Medicine Man' exhibit were too high for most wheelchair users. I did also spot a sign to say that audio descriptions, BSL guides and tactile materials will be added to the 'Being Human' exhibition."
2637,"Toilet was adapted to the best of their ability. Low sink, grab bars & emergency cord (however this was not close to the ground). No room for a larger wheelchair to get in & manoeuvre or transfer if a full-time user. Much smaller active chair users might be okay depending on turning circle & ability - just over 1 meter squared space from what I can remember. Very clean & tidy."
2638,No one came to look after us. 
2639,Could not have been more helpful.
2640,The building is very old and was originally used as Army Barracks. All entrances and doorways are fitted with push button automatic doors and are wide enough for the average size wheelchair. I would of awarded 5 if there were more Disabled parking spaces available (2/3) at the front of the building 
2641,Great adaptation for wheelchairs. But the experience is totally dependent on visuals and audio so would be very difficult if deaf and or blind. So fast moving and multi sensory I doubt BSL or voice over would work well? Was noisy - so problematic if you have tinnitus - the noise meant hubby could not actually hear what the actors were saying.   And there were numerous small spaces which would not be comfortable for some people.  But an interactive experience is not going to suit everyone.
2642,Disabled space outside but dropped kerb access not ideal
2643,"If you have the patience to look for an on street parking space, there are some available. The nearby tube stations are not accessible so I would recommend getting the trip to Green Park station and either taking the bus to Piccadilly Circus or rolling the 0.7 mile to Leicester Square."
2644,Large car parking area with disabled spaces. Lochwinnoch has a train station which is 1 mile from visitors centre.
2645,"As I said, level access and no doors. "
2646,Large doorway at street level
2647,This particular Pret A Manger is located on St Peter's street. The main entrance to the cafe is wheelchair compatible. As you get into the main entrance there is lots of the space to be able to choose the food that you want from the coolers and to order any hot drinks.  
2648,"It is level access to these premises. At the entrance the first door opens inwards the second one opens towards you, for a lot of people this would be difficult, for a wheelchair user it is the ultimate obstacle. I had someone with me and the staff came to help so wasn't so much of an issue. "
2649,"Johnstone train station provides rail travel between Johnstone and Glasgow (platform 1), and Johnstone and the Ayrshire coast (platform 2). "
2650,The Odeon at the Quay has had a make over ... nice new seating ect ...only thing that hasn't improved is disabled access more so for wheelchair users .... having visited recently i was disappointed to find the placement of the chair spaces was right at the front of the screen... my partner is the chair user and its too uncomfortable for her to sit with her head back to try and see the screen (we are both registered blind with different conditions) even this is to close! and this is not a practical solution ... all major uk cinema chains are guilty of this ... more disturbing is the newley built multiplexes wilhich treat wheelchair access as an after thought ... 
2651,Great staff!  They told me everything they were doing and when and they were very friendly.
2652,Good accessible pub on George Street. I like that you can order on an app and the accessible toilet is always clean.
2653,Top marks as it was level access to wheel in through the automated doors. Once in the reception it was friendly and welcoming. The reception desk has a dropped area which was good for me as a wheelchair user. All the rooms I visited were easy to get in and there was ample space to move around.
2654,"Cannot fault the food, it was lovely. Had a lovely meal but was let down by the wheelchair access.  Access when entering and leaving the restaurant was poor. I managed but wouldn’t recommend to wheelchair users. Once inside it was ok, but accessing the disabled loo was tight."
2655,"Step free entrance, room for wheelchairs to manoeuvre  "
2656,"Easy accsess, and also a lift available. Signage is good, large and bold."
2657,I came on wheelchair but left for the airport in a taxi which can park right outside. A short 5 min stroll will take you into the city centre straight onto O’Connell St which has bus stops and the Luas tram system.
2658,"What can I say ... Welcoming, cheerful, enthusiastic and happy to take their time to make sure our visit was amazing."
2659,Plenty of parking and bus links
2660,friendly and helpful though was a busy lunchtime
2661,Our party of 16 was well looked after for both drinks and meals. The food arrived together with several staff and was enjoyable. THe main waiter was both efficient and humourous.
2662,"Good, flat entrance but even for able bodied, the two doors were heavy to open. With five in the group, including myself using a walker and a wheelchair user, we were quickly allocated a table close to the door and on the same level."
2663,"We took a young lady who uses a wheelchair for respite and stayed at the chalet it was fantastic and equipped for her needs. It was a good base to visit Edinburgh and the icing on the cake was seeing the baby lambs. Kaye,James and family were superb hosts and nothing was a problem thank you so much hope to see you again. "
2664,"There is level access through the front door, but this can be a little tricky as it is a pull-door which could cause issues for some wheelchair users or people with buggies, when entering. When inside, it is a 'cosy' sized cafe, but all of the furniture is removable, so seating arrangements can be altered to suit your needs."
2665," Opposite the cafe at 45 Osterlanggaton, was a public accessible toilet. As i walked by I saw the door was open and the toilet had grab rails."
2666,Happy to help and point out the alternative parking option.
2667,Bumptious
2668,"Always nice, cheerful and communicate well!"
2669,"Large carpark with plenty of spaces and a  level forecourt for taxis and loading. The pub is located on Bradford Rd Sandbeds, nr Keighley with bus stops within 50m and Crossflats Railway Station 1.1miles"
2670,Good sized accessible toilet.
2671,Flat throughout on one level. Good space between exhibits to get around
2672,No close proximity parking. Taxi rank immediately outside served by several accessible taxis.
2673,Phenomenal. Handing out free bottles of water to those of us who were travelling home from a local festival. Really friendly and chatty.
2674,Girl spoke to me as I arrived and not to people with me.
2675,"There's level access into the station, lower desk at the ticket booths, disabled loo and ramps taking you under the station to all platforms. Staff incredibly helpful and reliable."
2676,Apart from the long distance from parking spaces in the shopmobility park there is excellent access inside. All flat. It is let down by there only being one small lift by the food court entrance. As prams have to use it too there is a wait when it is not even that busy. Saturday must be a nightmare.
2677,"Apart from being busy, access was okay. There was a Braille and touch map guide to the station, clear signage, a ramp up to the entrance and a stair lift down to the platform. There was an accessible loo on the way down to the platform. The lack of elevator access is what caused me to drop stars from this station unfortunately. The stair lift does not require wheelchair users to transfer to a seat as it is a roll on platform lift; but it isn't exceptionally large so may not be suited to all powerchair sizes."
2678,i think getting in would be the main issue as there are two kissing gates which obviously limit larger wheelchairs.  I have a TDX2 and did manage to get through but anything bigger wouldn't.
2679,There were disabled parking bays at either side of the entrance with a ramp.
2680,"Cineworld in Ashton Under-Lyne is very accessible for people with disabilities, however there could be a few problems for some individuals that can be improved, these problems are explained in the full review."
2681,"Pretty good! There were ramps in places, lifts and accessible toilets. Lots of interactive exhibits, a fantastic tour given upon arrival and then demonstrations of the equipment by Lily. There was too much to take in in the short time that we were there. Loved everything from the tours to the dress up box with full length mirror at the very end! It was great to be able to feel the jute at the different stages of the process too.  Just be aware that the ground is a little uneven on the bottom floor of the large mill room."
2682,"The only reason for 2 stars only, is because of the difficulty to get to the Spa building, but otherwise it is a very lovely place to take advantage of this quiet Spa and pool building. Sadly the Spa is not disabled friendly unless you can manage a longish walk along a path of chippings,  as pushing a wheelchair would be very difficult, but we include the review here which may benefit your family members while visiting this lovely old medieval hotel.  The Spa is set in its own area, situated in enchanting gardens and delightful pools, and 26 acres of woodland walks and pasture land. With its modern facilities of a large swimming pool, sauna, hot tub, steam room, and modern Gym, it still manages to hold its charm and elegance, and blends in well with the medieval hotel itself, which is surrounded by open spaces and woodland walks, first introduced as a hunting lodge in the 13th century, now with 26 acres for you to wander through, taking along your canine companion in this dog friendly hotel.  A delightful well maintained Moat surrounds this hotel (photo 1) and a paved pathway from the car park, (photo 2) leads towards the hotels main entrance, (photo 3) which is on the flat, then a double door awaits you to pull open. This leads you to the hotel reception, and a hallway (photo 4) which will lead to the separate Spa building.  The path crosses the moat (photo 5).   After going out of the hotel, you have to go down half a dozen steps (photo 6)  and there is no ramp available, and a long hard slog would await the carer to pull you over the deep chippings. Sadly, even though the Spa is set in beautiful settings and a lovely old building, (photo 7) we cannot recommend this for disabled people.  For an able bodied companion, there is a very attractive large swimming pool available (photo 8) and a hot tub., as well as a sauna. The Gym has a good selection of equipment including weights (photo 9) and treadmills (photo 10). To cool off after your training, there are delightful woodland walks (photo 11) passing many lovely pools, which lead to pasture lands (photo 12).  Our final thoughts Sadly, not for a disabled person, as far to difficult to reach the Spa and pool, steep steps, heavy going dragging you across chippings that pass a lovely little pond, nicely laid out area, and wonderful woodland walks.  So we cannot in any way recommend the Spa to you. (BUT DO SEE OUR REVIEW OF NEW HALL HOTEL AS THIS IS A DELIGHTFUL HOTEL IN ITSELF)   "
2683,"Normally, I would give the Eden Court Theatre five stars, Inverness Film Festival (which takes place in Eden Court Theatre) would only get 0, given their current ethos around inclusion, so I've gone for 2.5."
2684,This music venue and food facility has no disabled access and is only accessible by cobble steps at the front of the building. The doorways are too narrow for wheelchair access and there is no disabled toilet. The building also is multi levelled inside with various steps around premises. This is a shame is the food is very good and the staff are friendly and helpful! It is also a very dark inside so those with visual impairments may fine this a problem 
2685,"As mentioned in the accessibility review navigating wheelchairs, power chairs and such like adaptations would be difficult in this rather small and cosy restaurant. Similarly it would be perceivably be difficult getting to the second floor since there is no lift, only a narrow set of stairs forming a spiral stair case. There is nothing in the way off ramps to assist in wheelchair accessibility, however the steps into and out of the building are level and shallow and there is only one at each entrance and exit. The menus themselves are not available in Braille or large print."
2686,Had no experience of parking ( you are best using public transport in Edinburgh). Hotel is a short push from Edinburgh Haymarket station. Slightly uphill but i managed myself and im not that fit - all easy dropped kerbs.  Haymarket station is one stop from Edinburgh Waverley ( which is right in city centre). No trouble at all with 5 min train ride.
2687,"I used my local bus and, of course, all buses now need to be fully accessible so no fault there. Passing a car park on my way in, I noticed a section dedicated to Blue Badge holders, clearly marked with plenty of room to open doors, having wide cross-hatching at alternate sides of the bays."
2688,The staff member was very helpful and answered any questions we had about the ship and it's history. Really warm welcome from the staff too. 
2689,"Flat access into the restaurant, it’s not very big but was easy enough for me in my electric wheelchair."
2690,"Plenty of space , easy access and sufficient grab rails . Wheelchair accessible good sized basin was helpful too."
2691,"A wheelchair accessible ramp is available to access the  houses.  Walking around the neighborhood is a unique experience and definitely worth the visit.  The interior of the homes are not wheelchair accessible. The museum cube has steps, small rooms and low ceilings which is not suitable for all disabilities.  Some of the shops located within the neighborhood have smaller door ways that may or may not be wheelchair accessible."
2692,Good level access from the Galleries. Fairly good for wheeling around although some spots were a bit tight.
2693,"Fantastic, could not fault them in any way, service, attention to detail and courtesy spot on."
2694,Accessible toilet available just off reception 
2695,Main entrance has electric sliding doors and a lift to rooms. 
2696,We've attended several events here and every time access has been easy. The stewards are extremely helpful and will gladly take you to your seat. Accessible toilets are every few hundred yards and are always clean. I love it as my carer gets a free seat near me which is great. The only problem I've had is able-bodied people standing up in front blocking the view. 
2697,the staff are very welcoming  and helpful
2698,There could have been more signage for disabled access but it was still widely available which was good to see. There could of been more braille.
2699,A real surprise that I enjoyed this look back on musical machines going back over a century. Fully accessible modern building with plenty of space.
2700,Very positive and helpful throughout.
2701,"the room was on ground floor in court yard being in a wheel chair was quite difficult to get in room as had a high step had to get out of wheel chair and my husband had to help me up step, couldn't use the wheelchair in room , the room service was very quick and with a smile , breakfast in the morning was lovely plenty of room for my chair ."
2702,Stopped in for dinner at this rural pub before a couple of days in the Brecon Beacons and had an excellent high quality gastropub meal with some local beer. There is a gallery upstairs and some surprising wallabies and exotic birds in the back garden (the animals are mostly up some steps).
2703,"The wheelchair accessible loos had just enough room to manoeuvre my self-propelled wheelchair, but powerchair users may need to reverse out depending on the size of their chair.  Grab rails were provided.  Acceptable levels of cleanliness, but not great, probably due to it being really busy by all users."
2704,the manager and the staff are good at helping with any issue
2705,Parking can be arranged and public transport in the area is very good. The Millennium Bridge is useful for people coming across from the North bank of the river Thames.
2706,Access to the Creative Exchange is good and you enter through the glass doors in Constitution Street. Once in the main body of the building the space is open plan and there's plenty of room to get around. It's brightly lit and well laid out.
2707,"Old building but a very modern conversion so access is excellent rhroughout, including toilet and cafe. "
2708,"Because it is mainly a residential area, there are no official staff members.  However the people who work at the cube museum and other shops are helpful."
2709,Disabled parking was set up for the event.  Offered to get us closer.  Extra disabled parking was available as on this occasion it was at Lakeside Arts at Nottingham University.
2710,Access in and around the building:  Once it had been explained how to find the building; my friend and I entered the lobby and took one of the large lifts up to the reception area. The reception was bright and light.  I liked the bar and lounge area as there was plenty of space and not too much furniture for me to bump into as a visually impaired person.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible bedroom was bright and light. The windows providing some welcome natural light to brighten the room.  Access in the dining area:  The dining area is in the bar and lounge area.
2711,I have many positive experiences of this place.  I find it aspiring and educational as a young photographer. I also think the cafe is really good and the staff are very helpful.
2712,"We wanted to visit Malvern Museum of local history (photo 1). We left Rose bank gardens, (photo 2) down a very steep sloping path to reach cobbled street of Belle vue terrace (photo 3). Through the museum arch (4) and arrived at steps of Malvern museum. (5) the original gateway, with restricted access for disabled, and far to many steps to even bother to go inside. here they house the water cure room, with old wet treatments, and Malvern hills room with prehistoric and Roman activity. Then back to arch (6) and uneven steps before the hard effort of getting back up steep pavements to Rose bank gardens. We cannot recommend you to even try this difficult approach to museum."
2713,"All the staff and sailability instructors are exceptionally friendly, keen to understand and accommodate needs.  "
2714,showed us the way to the disabled entrance
2715,Extremely helpful
2716,There isn’t a car park as it’s on the street. There is on-street parking and a multi - storey car park near by which isn’t free for blue badge users.
2717,"It's such a relief when a place has been built to high standards with wheelchair access in mind. This recently-opened hostel has step-free access to all areas, with good-quality bathrooms for its accessible rooms and clean, spacious accessible loo in the dining room area. The real winner for me is always when I manage to find a family room with accessible bathroom.  During the day, you can visit the landscape discovery centre side of the building, which has a shop selling souvenirs, outdoor clothes and local maps, activity rooms, a lunchtime cafe and a green roof with a rooftop nature walk.  There are a couple of reasons I haven't given this five stars, though. The first is that we couldn't get a room with accessible bathroom on the first night of our stay, as it turns out that the accessible rooms aren't necessarily reserved for disabled people - they're also popular with families because they have five beds and an en suite bathroom. I went ahead with an ordinary room for just the one night, but the loo was hard work without rails.  The other thing is that when we did move into our accessible room for the rest of our stay, we loved it but I did wonder how it would work in there for someone using a larger wheelchair, because there was a point in the bed layout which was quite tight to get through even with my small three-wheeled rollator walker."
2718,"You can park near the door, though the car park is a little uneven. We didn't see any separate  disabled parking spaces."
2719,The staff were incredible and extremely helpful. Sophie was our tour guide when we visited and was absolutely fantastic. 
2720,Generally very good access throughout apart from bar area!
2721,"I was able to park right outside the house, therefore made it extremely easy to get in and out. "
2722,Entrance to the restaurant is step-free and it's possible for a wheelchair to move around the rather cramped layout with some mild inconvenience. Expect people passing behind you to kick and bash your wheelchair - this is annoying. Tables are a good height. 
2723,Ramp to get into the hotel and the wheelchair accessible room is on ground level so easy to locate your room.
2724,Staff at the hotel are great but it is common practice to tip.
2725,"Mildred's is located on the ground floor of a modern building and is entirely step free. There is a small al fesco dining area outside with free standing tables and chairs. The outside area is roofed over, see photo.   The entrance has double manual doors, which were open when we arrived. The restaurant is spacious and due to social distancing measures there is plenty of space between tables, see photo. There are free standing tables and chairs without arms, as well as a couple of sofas.  "
2726,"We loved this hotel in Kirkwall.  The accessible room has a large wet room with grips on the wall, bar that raises and lowers around the toilet, portable shower seat.  Big room with tons of space to turn around.  Lift to access room is available.  Restaurant and common areas all accessible.  Restaurant will cater to specific diets (OMS, vegan, dairy free..).  Good disabled toilet on first floor. No disabled parking bays, but hosts are great and let us park in front where they usually park hotel vehicles.  We loved it, felt really welcome."
2727,Couldn't be more helpful
2728,"We needed somewhere to meet my new work colleagues in or around Newcastle and Starbucks looked a good location. We had a little walk along the quayside first and over Millenium Bridge, which is just outside. Starbucks was easy to access. Toilets are through a lobby in the attached hotel."
2729,Very helpful staff; particularly at the checkouts.
2730,There's automated doors at the entrance. Then immediately in front of you is a staircase and a platform lift to take you to the main floor. There's large lifts to each floor and accessible toilets. 
2731,There was a very modern and spacious accessible toilet next to the reception area.
2732,"Although difficult to find the actual road from the village, access to the two lodges is good.  Parking at the back allows easy access to the gentle ramp which leads into the kitchen."
2733,Fully accessible facilities.
2734,Was asked several times by site staff if assistance needed. Stall holders helpful in lifting down items to view.  Witnessed a lady fall and a smallholder found a stool and offered a hot drink.
2735,"Lovely walk/wheel along the  route of the former railway line. For this one we start and finish at Alsop, stopping at Tissington for refreshments. Dramatic views. Good surface - lightly compacted earth for the main part. No inclines on the trail.. Small hill from former Tissington station then down into village.  We stopped at Herbert's Tearoom s for lunch and loos. "
2736,Careful attention has been given to the disabled access. Approaching the building found staff happy to help with the doors. An accessible toilets were available. The floors level and easy to get around for wheelchair users. The light colours and contrasts made it a good place for people with limited vision.
2737,"Top marks for the volunteer guides. Very helpful, friendly and informative."
2738,No steps only a little lip on the threshold which is easy to cross
2739,As with a lot of steam railways the stations and trains are spacious and fully accessible - ramps are available to assist wheelchair users onto the trains if needed.
2740,"All the staff, from the kitchen to the instructors were brilliant, friendly, helpful, competent and conscientious. We felt safe doing all the outdoor pursuits at all times. The whole place was very clean and had decent equipment that could cater for anyone's needs. The bedrooms were comfortable and the food tasty. Everywhere and everything was accessible to wheelchair users. I can't recommend it enough, despite the wet weather we still had a brilliant time."
2741,Staff are always incredibly friendly and accommodating 
2742,Smooth path to the entrance and electric doors mean access is straight forward.   The museum is several floors up but there is a lift. 
2743,"The Station has a car park what is big and it has buses what goes to it, also has trains a lot run by Scotrail"
2744,"We drove down and there is disabled parking available onsite but if it's very busy, you might struggle to get a space, however, there are non-disabled spaces in the overspill car-park across the road.  There are also buses from Bristol to Glastonbury which take about an hour and a half and there is a bus-stop located outside the Town Hall; the bus stops outside the hotel and takes about ten minutes. "
2745,Same as above
2746,Staff are very friendly and helpful. They will provide assistance if required and are very knowledgeable about the exhibits and the museum layout. They provide useful guides to assist with accessibility and direction to exhibits
2747,"Partick is a busy interchange station on the lines west from Glasgow Central and Queen Street. Trains go east to Glasgow, Airdrie and Edinburgh, west to Dalmuir, Balloch and Helensburgh, and north to Milngave and Cumbernauld. There is a subway entrance in the station building as well, although it's not accessible. Platform One for trains to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Airdrie and Cumbernauld, Platform Two for trains to Dalmuir, Balloch and Helensburgh. Shops and cafes close by as well as a bus station and Morrison's supermarket car park. Good access, a disabled toliet, plenty of space to get around and lots of trains make this one of my favourite stations! "
2748,The staff are very helpful and speak English.  They are willing to help you if needed.
2749,Very large coffee shop with plenty of different seating catering for all.
2750,"Norton Canes services are in Cannock on M6 Toll . The site is very environmental friendly with solar power in use, water is used for flushing toilets. The are several eateries with in the complex, as well as coffee shops and a newsagent. The food seating area is shared between all stalls. "
2751,Had never done the High Line before but friends had recommended it - a green and tranquil place right above the city - so pleased we checked it out! Perfect Sunday morning meander!
2752,"Before visiting the hotel for a wedding I phoned them to ask about wheelchair access, the staff were not very helpful and said there were stairs, I asked again specifically for information on wheelchair accessibility and was told there was a ramp to get in the conservatory but stairs to the function suites. No assistance was offered and information was limited. I’m a powerchair user but I have a manual chair I can use for short periods of time. There were many obstacles such as no accessible parking, chairs stacked infront of the ramp access door, and tight corners. It is a nice venue and if going on a quiet day for a meal in the conservatory it wouldn’t be too pribl"
2753,Amazing truly 5* people x
2754,"This independent café is a gem for any foodie or if you want to escape the busy city centre. It is located just off the Headrow, linked to the AgeUK building. The café is accessible to any one with a disability. Although I am not a wheelchair user, I witnessed the staff helping someone who was to make sure nothing was in their way. The venue has a great atmosphere with a natural light coming through the  glass. The food is slightly pricey but is absolutely scrumptious, I would particularly recommend the afternoon tea which is very good value. To top it all off, you can relax eating your cake knowing that all profits go towards AgeUK to help the elderly in the community - a very worthy cause!"
2755,We drove but there is a local regular bus service. Also the train runs from Glasgow central to Maybole where you can then get a taxi or bus 
2756,Ramped access to Disability Snowsports Office and flat access onto the train up the mountain and lift at the cafe at the top to access the mountain.
2757,Large easy open door lots of hand rails clean tidy good height toilet room for carer. Easy to find 
2758,"Access is obviously core to the whole experience that the Chalet offers its guests. From arrival at the car parking area adjacent through to the gentle ramp, wide doors, lowered surfaces, great vies and feeling of spaciousness it ticks so many boxes. I found moving around easy with my powerchair. The rooms are easily big enough for more than one wheelchair user to be holidaying here.   The entrances door and internal doors were all level access and wide. There were no unexpected thresholds or lumps and bumps to get over. The three bedrooms were all large enough to wheel into and the 'dedicated' accessible room was great. It had twin automatic profiling style beds, a fabulous ceiling hoist covering the beds, the bedroom space, and on into the wet room. There was plenty of space - we had two wheelchair users in the room at one point with bags of room.   The main hall links the rooms and was wide, bright and light' the natural finish of the timber adding much to the atmosphere. The main wet room was large enough for a 'party' and it was great to discover a Closomat loo! The other bathroom was equally spacious and conventionally fitted. That said, I was able to wheel in and could use the loo and hand basin easily if I wanted to.  The main lounge had plenty of windows with great views and a doorway out to the veranda. You had a choice of dining tables in that you could sit out and enjoy the view from the veranda or opt to sit inside around the large wooded table. The kitchen was integral to the room but with so much space it felt quite natural. With dropped counter, mobile units, knee space under the cocker and the sink as well as lowered oven it offered everything I'd be looking for as a wheelchair user if I decided to have a Jamie Oliver moment!  The overall feel and accessibility was great in that you could, just for once, forget about all the Access stuff as it simply worked and concentrate on how you'd enjoy your holiday! "
2759,"Del Amo Fashion center is a huge and beautiful shopping mall with over 200 shops, loads of restaurants and a cinema. The mall is newly built with wheelchair users in mind."
2760,Clean and plenty of room inside
2761,The theatre is a couple of minutes walk from Finsbury Park tube/ train station. The nearest step free tube is Highbury and Islington and then a bus journey (no 4 or 19 from Highbury Corner). At present there is building work taking place at Finsbury Park Station to enable it to become step free by 2019.
2762,"Great disabled access automatic doors on entry, lifts to all floors, accessible rooms are large and very spacious and bathrooms fitted with full wet-room which is also very spacious. "
2763,On street parking.
2764,There is a very steep slope to the beach. My scooter handled it well . You can’t get right down onto the sand but there is a compacted slope which will get you almost there. 
2765,"Able to park right by the reception.  Staff will valet park if required (if all disabled spots taken), and offer to carry all bags / equipment to the room."
2766,"Parking is on the street, there are disabled places but may be full."
2767,Museum doesn't appear to have own parking and you have to rely on public car parks or street parking. If you're lucky you can get a space in the carpark by the RNLI shop which is opposite the  Museum and then you don't have to walk or push too far. Blue badge parking in the public car park opposite is free but very limited.
2768,Helpful and friendly.
2769,"There are toilets , my husband said the gents was clean and tidy and there was a specific disabled toilet but as I didn’t use it I can’t say what it’s like. "
2770,"Lots of disabled parking available in each of the carparks for the shopping centre, multistory car parking has spacious lifts."
2771,"This is my second visit to this airport and the second which was not a success! On the first they denied that an ambilift existed and insisted that I was manually lifted onto the plane. On the return journey just one day later, the lift appeared!   Arrivals: The staff came to collect me from the plane and immediately started grabbing and pushing my chair without asking or saying anything to me. I had to grab the wheels and hold firm for quite a while before they agreed to let go. They were also very cross that I wanted to carry my bag, even though this was something I am perfectly capable of. The staff grabbed the bag anyway, and squashed some of the contents. Not thrilled! Once they had taken me through the secure area where assistance is required, they disappeared without a word.   Departures: I was sitting saying goodbye to my German friend at the check in area a full two hours before departure and the desk staff called me over to say I was late for my flight and I had not let them know I was here. I asked to go through by myself and they kept telling me I must wait for assistance staff. They kept trying to take away my boarding pass which is on my mobile phone so I didn't want this taken away to an unknown place by unknown people for an unknown purpose. After some back and forth of them telling me I was not allowed to go alone through security, that someone had to come and ""drop me"" (a scary prospect!) they came and took me through security, even though this area was perfectly accessible. Again, they grabbed at my bags and pushed my chair without asking until I refused to go anywhere until they stopped. He eventually let go of my chair but made off with my bags. Straight after security is where you have to be taken out through a side door to avoid the steps, so they could have waited here for me to give assistance. You are taken out through one door and in through another and then it's all accessible again, but the assistance people won't be leaving you alone!! They took my passports to show to passport control, I was not allowed to do anything. I was returned to the main departure gate along with the other passengers and loading onto the plane was as expected. Distances are not that huge, it's a small airport. "
2772,"The accessible toilets were varied. The one we used on the Lower Ground floor with the changing bench wasn't great as there was very little space between the bench and the loo which made moving aorund with a wheelchair / powerchair difficult. That said, the loo on the main floor was very good with plenty of room, it was clean and bright and light."
2773,Absolutely fantastic for a short trip out to see the donkeys
2774,Cafe near to  Cours Saleya which serves breakfast through to dinner. Good value and quality food. 
2775,"impeccable, such lovely owners"
2776,There is no designated parking although there are disabled spaces around the corner  There is a car park at Castle Terrace and spaces near the Usher Hall.   I  had to stop in town first so after my business I took a taxi.
2777,Easy access to get into the shop and wide aisle. 
2778,"Pleasant shopping experience , accessible independent High Street Retailer. Fabulous choice of quality produce, they boast 50 cheeses in stock, as well as selection of Scottish gins,  luxury coffees , teas etc, and my beloved Stornoway Blackpudding. Slight drawback in that it was a bit tight to manoeuvre the wheelchair in places, but owner was super helpful, and moved anything that was in my way."
2779,There is off street parking but it is busy in this area there is also a good bus service and train station in North Berwick
2780,"Only annoying point about toilets is that they are not based in the cafe or shop building, you have to go looking for them and go outside. It was suggested that better signposting and symbols would have been good"
2781,"Staff made the visit for us... We were a group of 8 including a powerchair user... Rocked up to see the brilliant David O'Doherty - saw the queue outside and thought yikes! However - we made ourselves known to a member of staff that escorted us to the best entrance, then showed us where the lift was - radioing their colleague in the process who met us at the lift and showed us to our 'reserved' seats. Staff super helpful - at no time did we feel that we were being rushed.  The only thing preventing this from being a 5* review? The lift - which is pretty tight - it's also quite tight to wheel out of when you reach the auditorium. "
2782,"Indian restaurant serving delicious, reasonably priced food. "
2783,"The visitor centre is at the end of a path from the car park. The entrance is cleverly tucked away around a ninety degree corner; just follow the pathway. Probably designed to avoid the wind and rain on a more dreich day.  The entrance is a wall of glass but having automatic doors you quickly see where to go. Heading inside the space is large and cave like. I did find the lighting in places to be a bit dull but soon cottoned on to the idea of just follow the crowds!  Getting tickets and sorting out the best way around was soon resolved at the ticket desk. The staff were quick to describe what was on offer and the order in which to see things. Very quickly, once I said I was visually impaired, an audio guide was produced and the staff showed me the buttons and described how it worked. With guide in hand I was all set to explore.   The exhibition was first and was set out so you followed the line of cabinets, pictures and displays, following the audio guide as you went. Part way round you had the option to pop into the theatre space and watch the film expand on the story of Culloden.   The lighting around the exhibits at times was the brightest but that probably to preserve the exhibits. Getting toward the end of the exhibition you come in to a large more open space and there are doors to go out in to the battlefield.  Once outside on the battlefield it was a little easier in so far as there were two lines of troops. These lines were depicted by the fluttering flags of the English and Scottish armies. The paths were clearly defined and easy to follow. Every so often there were plaques describing things, stones marking clan graves, and other features. "
2784,Excellent you can park outside your Lodge
2785,Very clean toilets with enough room for a wheelchair and carer. Have never taken the power chair which may be a wee bit tighter to manoeuvre.
2786,My daughter uses a walker or a helping hand and finds the church good for accessibility.
2787,I was unable to get into the public accessible toilets but the doors were a good size. The accessible toilets in the sponsors area were very spacious.
2788,"There is a very clear sign outside, so finding the restaurant was easy enough. There are two glass doors to enter, which need to be opened manually. This made it a little difficult for me getting into the restaurant. Once inside, there didn't seem to be many seating options for wheelchair users. Part of the seating area is upstairs, but we managed to get a small table at the front door. "
2789,"A one way system round the shop area, with at least 4 disabled bays. But only one disabled bay when you finally get round to cafe."
2790,Easy access to site - Over 500 acres - powerchair or wheelchair gets easy access for regular bus around the site if wanted and there is access to restaurant.
2791,"To the room itself therew is normally only 2 steps and then further steps depending on how high you want to sit in the stands. I explained my needs to the staff and they got me a chair straightaway so I didn't have to stand and wait as there is normally about 20 minutes waiting time out side the venue and then they showed me the way up the ramp to avoid the steps. At the top of the ramp, the chair was waiting for me again and I got first admittance into the hall to chose the front row seats in my stand so that I didn't have to use any stairs there either. Incredibly beautiful and accessible building with lots of space. Other gripe I would have is there was a lose floorboard next to our seats which with lots of people walking over it shook our seats causing a flair in my chronic pain. Easily fixed though!"
2792,I went for lunch and then back the following day for breakfast. Such a huge choice on 2 sides of an A3 menu. We sat outside on the pedestrianised street as dogs aren't allowed in (assistance dogs are). A good meal served by friendly staff.
2793,"Really friendly staff, approachable and helpful."
2794,"There is a 3 cm lip at the front door which does not present a problem,  but the pull door can be difficult.  I am a frequent user of the pub and have never had to wait more than 30 secs or so until another customer wants to leave or enter,  and kind help is invariably given"
2795,Large enough room for electric wheelchair user to manoeuvre plus have at least one helper in there. The nappy and sanitary bins are always in the way so transferring would be difficult. The toilet is usually pretty messy. I would prefer them to use a radar key but because this is also the baby change toilet there is resistance. The 2nd accessible loo is located inside the first door through to the guys toilets. This toilet is a bit smaller and more difficult to get around in. It is also very awkward to get into because of the ways the doors all open.
2796,"If traveling by car, accessible parking is available at the museum entrance.   If traveling with public transportation, the museum can be accessed via bus 29 (Stop Heemskerckstraat). The museum is also available by taxi and bicycle. The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can make arrangements for you."
2797,Not wearing masks at all times. Looked at me like I’m asking for something ‘extra’. 
2798,"The SNM has two parts to it, a Victorian building that is older in achitectural style and a more modern building attached to it. There is a seamless transition between the two for disabled visitors both adults and children with a large abundance of ramps and spacious lifts. As one would expect in a National Museum it has a time line which goes through the various galleries whatever the interest you have and the collection on display. There are fully interactive and learning tools for all ages, push button models and excellent audio discretion facilities available along with Braille reading opportunities. There are also guides on hand to give very comprehensive explanations on the collections. The entrances are now at street level - which was part of a multi million pound refurbishment, the outside pavement areas have been extended and widened to accommodate drop off points for car, coach and public bus service. Getting their from any direction is easy with bus, car or individual mode. The furthest transport link is train and tram 750m. You could literally spend a day here and not sexperience everything, admission is free there are 4 places from snacks to light lunches, a brasserie a coffee / tea bar to the Tower Restaurant on the rooftop terrace. Lots of disabled access in all areas, with fully appointed and easy disabled toilets that are well signed and radar key accessed if needed. The staff on all levels and in all places were excellent."
2799,"Staff were helpful, opening doors to let us in/out and moving the furniture in front of the loo - they did it all without being asked."
2800,"When I visited two staff members, Jenny and Tash, who were very friendly and helpful by moving chairs to allow us to sit outside."
2801," As part of the shop mobility service a trained volunteer are available be to assist service users on their journey, subject to availability. "
2802,Was dropped off by my PA. Parking in that part of London is really difficult to find. Bank Station is nearby and the DLR platforms are accessible.
2803,"On the main level of the museum, there is plenty of room to negotiate wheelchairs around the vehicles and there are lifts to the Mezzanine level and up to the restaurant/conference facilities levels. Shop, Restaurant and Cinema are all on flat."
2804,Accessible loo with grab bars but too narrow to turn a wheelchair or for side transfer and not deep enough to close door with power chair in.
2805,They are great 
2806,"Given the fact that everyone will need to visit the Post Office at some point, the lack of accessibility of the main Letchworth branch is shameful. Getting in through the door with a wheelchair is very difficult, and once inside the aisles are narrow and often have additional obstacles to manoeuvre around. The PO counter is right at the back of the store, the counters are high and the staff are effectively 'locked away' behind the screens."
2807,"An accessible Leisure center with disabled parking bays close by at the rear of the building within easy reach of the ramped access to the main entrance, dropped counters at the reception where friendly staff are always on hand to assist if needed. a selection of large, fully accessible toilets, changing rooms and shower rooms with alarm cords are available and easy to find. Once in the building it is level access to the changing rooms and swimming areas, there is a lift to access the gym and fitness suites."
2808,"The Isokon Gallery is a small gallery housed in the former garage of the Isokon Building, tells the story of the building and its amazing former residents, which included Agatha Christie, writer, László Moholy-Nagy, painter, as well as several Soviet spies. Originally known as Lawn Road Flats, the Isokon Building, is an elegant art deco building, commissioned by Jack Prichard, owner of the Isokon furniture company, and designed by Wells Coates. Opening in 1934, the flats were small, minimalist in design and came furnished. Also it was the first time reinforced concrete was used in British domestic architecture. The flats also had its own bar and restaurant, which was at one time was run by Philip Harben, one of the first TV cooks.   For 2021, there is a special Agatha Christie exhibition, which is utterly fascinating.  The gallery is open Saturdays and Sundays only, 11am till 4pm. It closes during the winter months. It's free to visit."
2809,"Accessible toilet, well signposted, grab rails available. Plenty of room & clean. "
2810,The restaurant entrance has level access but  the doors are heavy and so some assistance may be required. Inside is the reception. The bar and dining area (see photo) are downstairs and can be accessed from the reception via the stairs or by a lift. There are several tables. Not all the tables are easy to access if you are in a wheelchair. It is beneficial to inform the restaurant when booking that there will be a wheelchair user so that a suitable table is reserved.
2811,Staff is always lovely and very helpfull.
2812,"The approach to the pub's step-free entrance has nasty bumpy cobbles (one star lost for this). Apart from that, access into the pub is easy and there's plenty of room to move around. Most tables are wheelchair-friendly, beware of those with a cross-bar at floor level, these are wheelchair-UNfriendly but they are a minority among the many tables there. The bar counter is very high so you might want to bring a periscope if you're a wheelchair user. "
2813,"It was on the level from the car park, but can only make use of the bar lounge area, as from then on its was steps, so that was disappointing. "
2814,"I've given this a 2.5 only because I couldn't see inside it, the guard informed me it has rails all round and was a good size. He unfortunately didn't have a key to open it. It's located on the basement level floor along with the disabled access."
2815,"At the very bottom of the restaurant, the accessible toilet is in between the ladies and men's toilets, so watch out for doors opening either side of you as you enter and exit the loo. It's a great sized toilet, very clean and with a good length emergency cord. Half a star dropped for its location at the very bottom of the restaurant, reached by lift or two sets of stairs. "
2816,Staff are all very friendly and are willing to help with anything that may be needed.
2817,"Freeman Quay is a Durham county council leisure center. It is a fairly large center with automatic doors at the entrance of the building as well as a lift to the first floor. Overall it has good wheel chair access and plenty of disabled parking bays less than 30 meters from the entrance. There is a hoist used for both pools, the large and small pool so people arent restricted to what pool they would like to go into. Staff are very friendly and there is someone available to assist if needed. "
2818,It would have been 5 stars for the staff if the manager we spoke to about our concerns actually seemed interested and didn't make it look like we were making a big deal out of it.   The first raiders were superb so hats off to them.
2819,All I came into contact with were polite and courteous 
2820,"This was a return visit to Thatch Close cottages - the confidence of already knowing how good the facilities were removes a lot of stress for our wheelchair user. We took 2 cottages - Valley View and Brambles Barn plus rooms in the B & B  for further guests for a family do.  Every thing was great - facilities, cleanliness, welcome. The accessible bathroom is just great - plenty of room to turn the powered wheelchair, grip rails on both sides of loo/washbasin, etc. Getting the transport right up to the front door made transfer easy. Edward has upgraded the sofa and chair in Valley View to make it easier to get up from. The views from the garden area are magnificent - and we had splendid weather to appreciate them.  Edward and Marion are so kind and provide an excellent welcome  basket of home-made goodies. Highly recommended.  (An excellent website  provides details of the many adaptations and facilities.) So difficult to find any accommodation as well thought out as Thatch Close."
2821,Nearby free parking with disabled bays and some on street parking
2822,"There are disabled lodges , but I did not stay in one. Ordinary lodges have about 5 steps to enter the property . The kitchen, lounge, dining room is open plan and accessible. The bathrooms are not accessible. You could not get a wheelchair in either bathroom. The hot tub is also not accessible in the ordinary lodges."
2823,"Very small, no changing area and dirty."
2824,Good toilet but you have to ask for the key at the bar
2825,Friendly!
2826,There are six disabled parking spaces next to capability and the pavement is flat.
2827,"The accessible toilet is round the corner from the Drawing Room, next to the lift. It's really convenient and there is level access to it. The toilet itself was slightly raised which made the transfer easier. There were grab rails both side of the toilet. There was no grab rail by the sink, sorry my photo cut off some of the sink area. The emergency cord had been cut and was in the corner. I spoke to a member of staff about this and they said they would get it fixed. The accessible toilet was engaged when I arrived to use it, as the cleaner was inside, and it was spotless when I went in."
2828,There was a step into the main door but a ramp was provided.
2829,The disabled toilets are a generous size with grab rails and a lak of clutter.
2830,we had friends familiar withNorth Brewick with us so they could direct us. And the very helpful volunteer taking our booking gave excellent directions and advice. We also arrived at 10.30am so it wasn't too busy.
2831,Fantastic experience with friends in Aberdeen.  Very easy to access - flat entrance and all on one level. Disabled toilet in reception. Was great to be able to participate in the whole experience.  
2832,We didn't use them - but looked ok although on the small side
2833,"It is very good, moveable chairs and tables, plenty of room."
2834,"On first contact and appearances, it seems to be an accessible venue, however in practice I found it wasn't the case. It was one of my worst experiences in recent years."
2835,"Too many steps really, though I did see internal lift but it is not sign posted when you go in."
2836,I got dropped off by a taxi in one of the bays right in front of the building.
2837,"This privately owned castle does what it can to be accessible but some parts are impossible to access for those in wheelchairs/mobility scooters/rollators and difficult for those who use sticks/crutches. That said, the staff are helpful and friendly, ready to go out of their way to help. One carer accompanying a disabled visitor is allowed free entrance."
2838,"It was a bit of a struggle over the dunes, which required a push through some soft sand. There was a narrow boardwalk for about half the way through the dunes. However it wasn't too far or so horrendous I wouldn't do it again! The beach was superb when I visited. Good firm sand after a few metres of soft stuff at the end of the dunes.  We'd hoped to get all the way Bamburgh but had to turn back about two thirds of the way there due to a rocky outcrop the full width the beach."
2839,"A person with a cane could possibly use the loo, but it’d be sketchy. Not enough room for a person using a scooter or a wheelchair to negotiate , and certainly no space for a carer. "
2840,"An excellent accessible day out. Travelling on foot from the beach to Peasholm Park station, there were no steps whatsoever; it's all steady uphill pathways and ramps, both into the station and onto the train. The train terminates at Scalby Mills, which is on the side of a steep hill. But again, the whole area seemed to have been built with very much a 'Barrier-Free' ethos - impressive considering the period in which it was designed and built."
2841,"This venue is fully accessible for a wheelchair user. The problem is that it can get very crowded on a Friday and Saturday with a very lively clientele! If you do not like crowds and would prefer a quiter, perhaps less boisterous venue, this is not for you."
2842,"This place is huge, the upper bit is only accessible by steps, which a ramp could had easily been put instead. But the lower section is big and is accessible with an accessible loo. "
2843,Ramp from carpark . Shop and cafe on one level. Part of the outside seating area is up a step
2844,Disabled parking close by if going by bus thee is a short walking distance involved.
2845,"This museum has by the Harbour in Whitehaven is a great place to visit and learn about the local area. The staff are friendly and there is a shop and restaurant with accessible toilets and a lift to all floors. I am a wheelchair user and find it easy to manoeuvre around the building.  The accessible toilets all have the alarm cords reaching to the floor - not always the case with other places I visit. There is free disabled parking available. The exhibits are interactive and interesting. The staff are extremely helpful and nothing is too much trouble especially in the Wellington Cage, which serves snacks as well as cooked meals. There is also a new ""portal"" building which provides accessible meeting rooms for hire, my only criticism is that there needs to be additional disabled parking for the Portal. The adjacent harbour has a level walk around it and work is underway to make the old quay as near to fully wheelchair accessible as possible within the constraints of the age of the structure. Well worth a visit"
2846,No designated disabled toilet's available.
2847,Toilets are up a ramp. Quite awkward to open the door at the top of the ramp if you're on your own.They are all individual toilets off the corridor. The disabled toilet is large with good grab rails but no red cord
2848,The staff were really helpful and bring everything you need. They even got people to move out of the most accessible table so I could sit at it!
2849,"The toilets were perfectly adequate for me. I had no difficulties - and as I say they'll have there Changing Places toilet up and running quicker than you can say antidisestablishmentarianism (by there next home game, I believe). If you require a hoist, you're safest bet is to ask for a seat close to this. And EG are going to send them cards from the Red Cord Campaign, too!"
2850,Good accessible toilets with plenty of grab rails.
2851,We went by public transport.  The venue is a small walk away.  Leaving was much busier in general in the area which made it a more difficult walk then arriving.  Staff at the train station were helpful. 
2852,"The food at the bakery's incredible, choice available is vast and the staff are so helpful. As soon as I came in, a member of staff sat down at a table and kept this place from me and my wife. He really didn't move until we returned with their food! The counter with the choice of food is enormous and it can be hard to pick what you want however I will guarantee that it will be incredible. One minor issue I had was when I got towards the end of the counter, there is a column and it was a very tight squeeze to get a wheelchair through. I will hold my hands up and say that could just be my terrible driving however if you're in a manual wheelchair, this will hurt your fingers. This let this put you off, I am certain the staff will help  get food for you if you ask."
2853,Accessible loo was close to the restaurant and easy to find. Access wasn't very wide and it wasn't very big inside. Just enough space for the wheelchair and a carer. Manageable but tricky. Grab rail on one side. No room for Changing Places toilet. All very clean and tidy.
2854,Accessible public toilets round town require a Radar key and as usual some shops offer them too. 
2855,Very helpful and friendly
2856,"I love how they have used space inside this small shop, the layout is good and it’s not over cluttered. It’s light and bright too with good contrasting surfaces.   The star rating is so low simply because of the one small step into the venue. "
2857,This is a fantastic venue to hold an event in or a club/group. 
2858,"Good level access, parking, accessible toilets, and plenty of space."
2859,Surprisingly good access. Doors easily manageable and aisles allowed enough room for good wheelchair access.
2860,The entrance doors are not easy to negotiate when you are in a wheelchair but it is possible.There is now a beautifully decorated area where you can have drinks and snacks.  There is plenty of space to move a wheelchair around  but it is difficult to get a wheelchair under any of the tables in this area . The atmosphere was civilised and The staff were more than willing to help.There is also a restaurant area where there is table service. Unfortunately this area can only be accessed via stairs which makes it inaccessible for wheelchair users. However there is a private dining area which also has table service and is on the ground floor and so is wheelchair accessible. It does need to be booked.
2861,We drove to the venue. There's a steep drive which has car parks at three different levels. The disabled access and parking is right at the bottom by the outside seating area. There are several disabled parking bays. This car park is flat and tarmac.
2862,"Kind, helfpul and they knew what I needed before I arrived and provided it"
2863,"People I met were helpful if asked, but I hardly had need to do so. "
2864,"Step free access and if when booking, a wheelchair is mentioned, the manager will position you it a table that is suitable for one's needs.  Most obliging."
2865,"Friendly, keen to help and advise. "
2866,Easy to find accessible toilet; very large with hand rails
2867,Ramped access throughout. Good lighting.
2868,Ramped access from door with sharp turn.
2869,"All staff we met where friendly, going out of their way to offer support and help, reception very polite and all knew what they were doing."
2870,"Debenhams has barrier free access straight from the car park or the shopping centre's main concourse. The store has an accessible toilet , cafe, and several departments for shopping."
2871,Lift from underground carpark to Tesco front doors
2872,We used wheelchair access taxis and a travel Counsellor to arrange our airport needs.
2873,"This site is just off the M1 at J31. You can actually see the motorway from the site, though no noticeable road noise. The road into the site is wide enough for two vehicles to pass.   The path from the campsite down to the country park is steep and very uneven. I decided not to attempt it on my own. To drive down, you have to go back to the main road and down to the next right turn. Shame there isn't an accessible path down but it whatever they did would mean a fair climb back up."
2874,There is disabled parking in the pedestrianised parts of Lancaster very close to the museum. There is ramp access for those that cannot make the 5 steps up to the main entrance.  The museum bare so secret artefacts found  in 2005 as well as the Kings Own Royal regiments Museum. If you have visited the Castle and the priory church then this is close by to visit too and there are some great coffee shops in the vicinity too
2875,"Access in and around the building:  For me getting in to the building and around to the apartments was easy once I had someone show me the way.  The apartments themselves were well laid out and equipped. They were bright and light which is good for me as a visually impaired person. Assistance dogs were welcomed which was good to hear.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The bedrooms and bathrooms were not specifically designed to be accessible. That said, they worked well for me and were spacious and bright and light.  Access in the dining area:  The kitchen and the dining / lounge area was spacious and bright and light. Well furnished the apartments were an attractive alternative to hotel accommodation.  Access to other facilities:  The apartments are all self contained and there are no other facilities."
2876,A bit cramped and difficult to get into.
2877,"It was easy to get in through the automatic door. The security staff waved me through to a conceirge . I asked her where the toilets were and she led the way through the large foyer and enusred someone else would be able to lead me to my seat. The toiets were good and I was then lead through wide smooth corridors into a large lift up to the spacious area for scooters and wheelchairs. The signage  to bathrooms, bars and lfits was very clear."
2878,They are friendly 
2879,"Yep, close to the restaurant, all clean and tidy. Staff have a key if it's locked."
2880,Car park was small and fubctional. No disabled places but to be honest I have never seen another car there. 
2881,"Its pretty easy to get about as a wheelchair user apart from when its super busy (but that's the same for everyone). Staff were excellent, very attentive and took us into the show beforehand, offering us a choice of seating. They also offered our friend a seat while we queued for the show to start going in. Only gripe was the challenge finding the accessible loo as it wasn't very well sign posted and had flyers all over the door which made it very hard to spot!"
2882,Lift small.
2883,There was plenty of room for my eleltric wheelchair in the cafe. we had a nice hot lunch and  I found the staff very helpful.
2884,"As a remote forest with is a bit off of the beaten track the best way to get here is by foot, cycle, horse or perhaps even a car. Public transport kit pretty scarce and the only way you'd get here is by taxi from one of the nearby villages. You leave the main road and follow the Forest signs that direct you down a long driveway bordered by fields until you enter the forest. Soon you are completely under the canopy of the tall pine trees as the single track tarmac road loops into to a clearing and the parking 'slots' beneath the trees. At the centre is a small wooden building where there is an information point and toilets. You find three or four accessible parking bays for Blue Badge holders just beyond the building. A pathway links the parking bays to the toilet block for easy access."
2885,There is disabled parking. The bus stop is close to park entrance and is actually within the park grounds. However the more frequent bus stop for return journeys is 1/4 of a mile from the park entrance.
2886,Could not have been more helpfulbor friendly. Real enthusiasts for the venue.
2887,staff are always very helpful and will help carry heavy shopping to tills and then to vehicle if required. They will also help to carry over your food in restaurant is required. At the till the staff go out of their way to you!
2888,The shopping Mall did have lots of underground parking but we did not se it.
2889,Large public car park alongside venue
2890,Level access throughout but quite tight to manoeuvre a wheel chair or walker around shopping area.
2891,Spacious and clean toilets but frustration hit when the red cord was obstructed by the hand rail. Picture shows after I rectified it and I annoyingly didn't bring any Red Cord Cards with me. Red cord seemed to be hanging enough to the floor (perhaps more though).
2892,Always helpful and accommodating. 
2893,They were very good and had a lot of room. You may need help with the doors to get in.
2894,Warm friendly welcome from owner
2895,"Booked a Blue Badge parking space at the museum.  On arrival the security guards had my name and car details on a list.  They let me in and directed me to my parking space just in front of the main entrance to the museum.  On entering the museum, they had a wheelchair with my name on it all ready for me.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful and I got the impression that nothing would have been too much for them. My parking space was booked for the whole of the afternoon and I was able to enjoy the Beckett exhibition without worrying about time.  It was the most relaxed visit to a museum I have had in years.  The museum staff spoke to me and my 'carer' equally.  I will certainly be visiting the museum again as it was so easy to book a space and all the staff were so helpful."
2896,No loo. However we left the path at Middleton and visited the Crown (see my other review) which has an exemplary assisted loo as well as great access and food. At Romaldkirk the hotel has a downstairs loo which is not adapted but you can wheel to the door and then walk into the cubicle if you are able - staff very helpful.
2897,There's a ramp for entry but it's a very small shop. There is seating and enough space for a powerchair or wheelchair. The contactless reader is right at the front of the low counter too and you can see which donuts you want as well. The menu is very visible but no alternative formats I'm afraid/.
2898,"We walked, but there are lots of public transport options on the surrounding main streets. Pavements are quite good in this part of town."
2899,"There are 2 disabled toilets in the ski centre. One is close to the ski slope and i think is used as a bit of a ""free for all"" toilet. The other- which is usually a bit cleaner- is behind DSUK's office"
2900,The hotel is only five minutes from the railway station at Waverley. It’s also next door to the airport bus services as well as taxi ranks.
2901,"Two of the lodges have closomat toilets.  There is plenty of space around the toilets, some for left hand transfer, some for right hand transfer.   There are grab rails and plenty of space (we had two wheelchairs and a carer in the bathroom at any given time). There are additional bathrooms/cloakrooms for guests/other party members and these too are all accessible.  Everywhere was clean and hygienic. The sinks were too small and this will be addressed in the new lodges in phase two."
2902,"There is an accessible toilet, which is a good size. However the door swings inwards, so some manoeuvring is required "
2903,Free Parking onsite. There are many disabled parking spaces and it is very easy to park and a short distance to walk to your hotel.
2904,This was a private taxi tour so I was collected and returned to my hotel.
2905,The British Library is on Euston Road next door next door to St Pancras Station and close to King's Cross and Euston Stations. Nearby is King's Cross tube station which is step free. Euston tube station is not step free and Euston Square tube station is only step free west bound. There are also a number of bus routes that stop outside the library. I travelled by bus. There is a bus stop directly outside and one the opposite side of the street.
2906,I'd always heard great things about this hotel but never had the opportunity to visit before - really pleased to finally get the chance! We were only there for a conference but based on our experiences will definitely be back for a longer visit! The hotel is in an amazing location with loads for all members of the family to do!
2907,"All the staff I interacted with when visiting Longparke were very welcoming and helpful. It was very busy the day I visited so, they asked me which table would be the best to access."
2908,Clean and tidy. Fairly spacious too. Loo is located on the Ground Floor near to the shop and cafe.
2909,You can park on the high street next to the fish bar.
2910,"We were able to park on the yellow lines directly outside the theatre, which has a step-free entrance just across the pavement next to the other entrance, and it was then only a short roll down a sloped corridor to the stalls, passing a snug but manageable accessible loo on the way. The wheelchair spaces are at the back of the theatre under the circle, which creates the usual letterbox view of the stage as well as restricting vision. However, this was mitigated by the fact that the sound and lighting were excellent and the theatre is relatively short. The direction had also taken this into account and there was no action we could not see. Refreshments could be ordered from our seats and were delivered to us in the interval by helpful friendly staff."
2911,Not built yet but will be big enoiugh for wheelchair to turn a full circle
2912,Door was open and counter easy to access. Tables too close together for scooter access 
2913,"This review relates to my week long stay in hospital following surgery in October 2019. I had been diagnosed with womb cancer and had a hysterectomy. The medical and nursing care I received was excellent. However, this review is focusing on disabled access. There were problems with accessible toilets, shower, bed and a couple of one off incidents with the staff."
2914,"Southpour is the new go-to spot in Edinburgh's massively studenty neighbourhood, Newington. With friendly staff and 'easy access' literally painted on the wall, it's definitely worth checking out."
2915,"The only negative comment I have is the ""drop off / pick up"" area. We were in hurry as were the other folk being dropped off and it's not that easy for several cars to be there together. Parking is nearby though if needed. And there are lots of buses that serve the station."
2916,"The toilet was good, with one omission, the door open inwards, which would prove a problem for a larger wheelchair."
2917,The loo is very easy to find. The door to where the toilets are located is heavy and does not open electronically. Once inside the accessible toilet is left unlocked so no problem if you don't have a radar key and users are spared the indignity of having to ask. The toilet was very clean. There is a baby changing shelf but not one suitable for an adult. The red cord was in place and reached to the floor.
2918,"A very agreeable accessible toilet in the basement, with everything just as it should be. The paper towels are exceptionally strong and butch."
2919,A huge car park with plenty of space for disabled parking.(Gravel surface)Only a short walk to the house on tarmac road. I don't think it is served by public transport but there were plenty of coach parties there.
2920,very friendly
2921,Ramps or lifts available though out the theatre Any steps clearly signed and staff made our group aware of any changes of surfaces on touch tour
2922,"The store is accessible, flat with large aisles. There is easy access from the car park on the bottom level. The staff are friendly and helpful. The lifts are large enough for three push chairs and a little extra.  With low buttons. The cafe is large with close access to the large toilets."
2923,Very helpful staff.
2924,"Standard premier inn with a great restaurant next door! Great, welcoming staff."
2925,There is level access to the premises. You would need a hand negotiating the two doors if you're using a wheelchair. There are plenty of tables and the staff were very accommodating finding me somewhere suitable. 
2926,"Not very easy to enter the shop, with rather a narrow doorway, with a small low step. No where to sit inside the shop, but seating available just outside, or in the cafe itself in separate building."
2927,The toilets are pretty much all the same over the entire hospital so far. Some have more floor space than others. Grey grab rails around toilet and sink. Lowered hook. Several bins. Toilet flush handles not adapted.   No changing place toilet available.
2928,Easy to find. Flat entrance with electric doors. Lift to get to floors 
2929,The nearest accessible toilets are with the riverside museum which have handrails but no changing places toilets 
2930,"It was all suitable for my mobility scooter though some sections were quite bumpy. The bigger your wh the smoother the ride. All the paths were wide which makes passing other walkers, cyclists and dogs easy. "
2931,"This is a beautiful historic venue on Edinburgh's Queen Street, but as a listed building it does come with some access restrictions which they communicate on their website. "
2932,There is a buzz door that can be tricky to do but the do come and open it for you 
2933,"Choice of 3 on ground floor with hoists. 1 Standard, 2x shower toilets, ceiling hoists and movable sink units. Upstairs standard accessible toilet-no hoist with all other features in place."
2934,"We were staying next door to here on holiday. They have a nice outdoor area, for drinks and food, accessed from the street, up a slope. They also do good carry out pizza (collection only)  We also sat inside for a meal. There is a small step at the front door, with a raised threshold immediately after it. My husband was able to manage the step, but the combination of the step and threshold was a little difficult. Would be difficult for a power chair. There is a disabled toilet inside "
2935,"There is a disabled toilet but if I remember right, it isn't that great.  They have got a swing door to the toilets and that isn't really accessible if  the person is on their own."
2936,"Very clean with decent hand dryer and hand wash, also has baby changing facilities"
2937,"If I could give zero stars I would. The accessible loo is in with all the stalls. It’s the last stall. Very small and the door opens inwards, which means as a wheelchair user I couldn’t shut the door so had to use the toilet with the door open and people coming in and out close by which was degrading and stressful. They hadn’t even considered getting advice on their ‘fully accessible’ exhibition. "
2938,"The V and A has two step free entrances in Cromwell Road and Exhibition Road. I entered from Cromwell Road and there is a gradual slope as well as steps to the entrance. There was a revolving door and an accessible entrance next to it. When I arrived I got  manual wheelchair from a number which are near to the entrance.  On my visit I stayed on the ground floor visiting the Frida Kahlo exhibition and restaurant. The entire route was step free. Getting to the exhibition involved going through the gift shop, the aisles were wide enough but it was busy.  The Frida Kahlo exhibition was very popular and sold out on the day we visited. The exhibition focuses on her as a person and her image with a collection of personal artefacts and clothing. There is only a small display of her art work. We had timed admission and there was no queue when we arrived. The exhibition was laid out in a series of rooms. The first was a long, straight corridor with paintings and photographs on both sides of the walls. The exhibits were at standing height but the labels were at a lower level which was perfect for me in a wheelchair. The other rooms had items on the walls plus display cabinets which were at wheelchair user height. I'm glad I used a wheelchair to get around as there was no fixed seating inside the exhibition. Frida Kahlo was a disabled artist and one of the rooms focuses on her health and disability. On display is her prosthetic leg, decorated corsets which she wore after her operations and an assortment of medication. There are several photos that includes Frida's wheelchair. Interestingly when I was in this room people were very aware of my wheelchair and proactive about moving to let me see the exhibits, while in the other rooms both before and after I was often invisible.  At the exit there are manual doors but a member of the public was there and opened the door for me. Exiting via the gift shop there were two unmarked slopes, both of which caught me by surprise and I nearly needed up rolling into members of the public.  The café is self service with free standing tables and chairs. It was busy when we visited."
2939,"Friendly and very helpful. The patron speaks excellent English, but then he is English."
2940,"You need a car to get here as there is a long rough road (3 cattle grids) through the country park before you arrive at the visitor centre. There are 4 disabled parking spaces on smooth tarmac, The rest of the plentiful parking is on rough stones."
2941,Friendly efficient and helpful
2942,"First Class, always available, polite, friendly, welcoming and very supportive, the same must be said for their very professional and punctual delivery service, they are there when they say they will be."
2943,Small sea front hotel on the Esplanade with lift. The hotel has a restaurant and bar attached. 
2944,Courteous and helpful.
2945,I was very impressed with the staff in this store. The member of staff that I chatted with understood I needed some more time to process and offered to support me during the shop. I didn't need this support but it was nice to know they could help.
2946,Plenty of parking in the grounds outside the building. Taxi can drop off at the front or back entrance to the building. A member of staff was stationed at the front door to direct visitors to wherever they needed to be.
2947," we tried 30 other venues and travelled for over an hour to this one. our group is 10 people. we have grandad with Dementia and in a wheelchair. two daughters with complex needs and a son with learning difficulty. there was no way we could feesibly split our group and this venue allowed us to take part in THE CABIN IN THE WOODS a locked room experience.  The staff were very helpful, very patient and we all had such a good time!       escapermk.co.uk / info@escapermk.co.uk / 07727 984004  "
2948,Accessible toilet was adequate and clean. Access is level but slightly awkward and difficult to see since faces away from the pitch on the middle of the access ramp. It may be smaller than comfortable for carer assistance but I would defer to carers for comment.
2949,"fantastic day out for all ages, easy to find. Travelled by car as it is about a 15 minute from the bus stop and up a long uneven road but by car absolutely fine. Staff are very friendly and willing to help with anything."
2950,"A fun Fringe outing with a large group of people to see theatre and acrobatics. Venue staff were super helpful, and the view from the wheelchair accessible seating was great."
2951,"The door opened automatically, and access to the seating area was along a spacious foyer and wide doors hinged open. The box office and toilets are in the same area, all within a short distance of each other.  All seats in Row D can be booked by wheelchair users, and the physical seats can be removed to accommodate a wheelchair user remaining in their wheelchair. Access is level from the foyer with no need to use ramps or lifts.  The cafe was fully accessible, every seat could be moved about to accommodate wheelchairs, so it was possible to pick and choose exactly where I wanted to sit to enjoy my pre-show drink. "
2952,"This was a well planned, well presented and well conceived event in conjunction with PAMIS and Euan’s Guide for Disabled Access Day. Being old fashioned and a bit of a traditionalist, the Gallery it’s contents and exhibitions were not my cup of tea, though I was surprised and inspired by much of what I saw, experienced and able to appreciate. The NG of Scotland have made a really big statement on inclusion and accessibility by opening on this DAD a fully equipped Changing Places toilet to compliment their other disabled access facilities. The former John Watson School for girls is large, spacious and well laid out over 3 floors, the ground and upper being divided into halls and rooms for exhibits of paintings, sculpture and laid out works.  On the ground floor usage is made of the corridors as exhibit space leading to a well provisioned, well stocked shop, sales of exhibitors work   and accessible resource areas - this is where the PAMIS sensory storytelling took place.The lower floor is where the toilets are located and a wide accessibility cafe, there are lockers, a buggy and chair area available. The catering provision is Heritage Portfolio so the standards, range of foods of quality and service are high, as was the case. Overall a popular venue for its large outdoor areas, water features and it’s packed events guide throughout the seasons and the year. The cafe and the Gallery were populated by children of all ages and stages and there programmes for younger one and those a bit Oder that are learning, experiential and thought provoking. To say this is a venue I would return to would be understated, its fantastic, welcoming, attentive and available staff who are well informed and always on hand - recognising those with additional needs. "
2953,Access is through the Roseburn street gate and then a short walk to the lift which takes you up to the 1st floor where the toilets and the food stand is then you take a left turn and your seat is right there. Smooth floors throughout.
2954,"Changing room place. This means there is hoists and a bed available. The room is very big with plenty of space for chair, carers and hoist."
2955,Very clean.
2956,Friendly and very helpful.
2957,1 hide at the far end of the site has rough paths to access the hide. It is still accessible and it is worth the effort with floor to ceiling glass windows offering brillant views across the wetlands
2958,"An accessible gym, swim and fitness centre with an accessible cafe. "
2959,The Golden Jubilee Bridges are pedestrian bridges attached to the Hungerford Railway Bridge. They are accessible by wheelchair from Charing Cross Station and by lift from the South Bank; handy for waterloo Station and County Hall.
2960,Disabled parking is immediately on entry off main road. Mainline train station half a mile from the venue
2961,There were two bathrooms. One is accessible. Large. Toilet had grab rails. Shower chair with wheels. Bath not accessible.
2962, Disabled Portaloo on board and also a normal toilet.
2963,Viewing felt limited. Only one accessible toilet outside on the level.
2964,Polite and friendly 
2965,"There is a small car park across the single track road right at the entrance to the garden. It is impossible to drive right up to the door, but the garden path leading the the tearoom is wide. If you want to take a taxi, it costs around £10 from Aviemore train station."
2966,One disabled parking space immediately outside reception but others far away so not enough spaces.
2967,"Came by taxi to GDA, dropped off outside."
2968,The kids did find the ramp a little sloppy 
2969,"Loads of room and easily found. Hand rails, clean , tidy and if you need it there was space for carer."
2970,"Staff have been friendly, welcoming and helpful whenever we have visited. "
2971,"There are toilets within different facilities, and a changing places toilet within the Tate gallery."
2972,ramp outside or stairs shopping centire one level
2973,Level access into café and within café seating area.   There is room to accommodate a wheel chair.
2974,"Really helpful, right from the booking stage"
2975,"There is an accessible toilet in the basement, but I didn't use it when i visited."
2976,"I have visited the Usher Hall for concerts a few times now and each time have been impressed. I have been on the lower ground for two concerts, one amongst the standing audience and one amongst seated audience. When in the standing audience, a platform is positioned to allow wheelchair users and those with mobility issues to be raised slightly above the crowd. Within the seated audience, seats are removed to accommodate wheelchair users. Another concert had been to at this venue, I was one level above and the venue has an elevator to take you up to a very uniquely placed space at the edge overlooking the stage, what a fantastic view!"
2977,Small venue but lots of space in 'front of shop'.
2978,"Excellent trail for wheelchair users, this is an out and back route with a nice tearoom with an accessible loo at the turning point. It's a decent length - probably an hour plus each way. Though a little bumpy in a few short sections (really not too bumpy at all), the track is well surfaced. There are no inclines. We started at Weags Bridge and went to Wetton Mill.  You could reverse if preferred (nb there are no facilities at Weags Bridge)."
2979,Excellent
2980,"Once you are in the car park area which is also where the main entrance is situated it gets better. Your challenge is being able to negotiate the lack of dropped curbs to even get this far! Once inside having passed through the automatic doors you will be greeted by security and after a quick check you proceed into the main area of the building. It's all level access and fairly easy to wheel around, there are dropped counters, and a hearing loop."
2981,The bar owner was not there so I was not able to give my feedback
2982,Car or Taxi access only
2983,"We decided on a whim to make a loop of the loch. It is 5.6 km and while there are no steps, certain stages are quite hilly and I could not have managed alone. The cafe at the Watersports Centre was very good and had one of the best disabled toilets I’ve ever used!"
2984,"The accessible entrance to this venue can be found round the back, and is a single, manual door that isn't particularly heavy. Immediately to the left is a platform lift to go down into the venue. The platform lift does require rotating 90 degrees between getting on an off, but is large enough to accommodate this, even for a powered wheelchair. The tables and chairs are spaced far enough apart to move between them, and the majority are at a comfortable height to reach from the wheelchair. Most of the chairs are easily moved to açcommodate wheelchairs too. Some of the bars and street food vendors have high counters, and with the music it can be difficult to communicate with staff. However, the staff are extremely friendly and welcoming, and seem well trained at handling disability. I wasn't there for too long so didn't use the bathroom, but I believe the disabled toilet lacks full changing facilities. There are several bus stops and taxi ranks close to the venue, and the train station is about half a mile away, making it easy to get to on public transport. However, nearby car parking is extremely limited. The pavements surrounding the venue have large cobbles, so can be bumpy or slippy, but are perfectly passable."
2985,"Egyptian (including the beautiful portrait bust of Nefertiti), Trojan (some of Schliemann's finds at Hissarlik), Roman and German antiquities housed in a most unusual building. The original building was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in WW2. English architect David Chipperfield designed a rebuilding which preserved some of the original, while inserting modern structures into the shell. He also ensured that the museum, which re-opened in 2009, is fully accessible."
2986,"A little confusing is the two disabled toilets are within the female toilets, I am sure it’ll be the same for the male toilets. I knew this due to my last visit and the people attending the loo just let me and my carer straight into the loo area so I could access the toilet.  "
2987,These are dotted about  and are good.
2988,Step free access and elevators within.
2989,"a very friendly place,all down stairs very disabled friendly,disabled toilet easily accessible,doors are wide enough for a wheelchair also a ramp at the entrance."
2990,Most accomodating and friendly volunteers
2991,"Staff are very helpful. Their is only one accessible toilet, which is not very accessible .The seating for wheelchair users gives a very good view of the stage , but the carer has to sit in front. By phoning the box office direct , the carer gets in for half price .  The parking locally may be difficult. We parked in a nearby side street."
2992,"Good access, staff couldn't of done any more but covid precautions were non existent "
2993,Very friendly and thoughtful
2994,Right next to disabled access on flat level
2995,"Unique experience where the chef cooks your meal in front of you. Delicious and fresh! My only grumble is that my wheelchair does not fit under the tables. The toilet is huge, with very few bins, which is brilliant."
2996,The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful during my visit opening doors providing with directions
2997,"Centrally located hotel with nearby on-street parking, drop-off outside and bus-stops100-300 yards away.  Fully wheelchair accessible.  Excellent food and good service n the Brasserie."
2998,"2 disabled toilets, one upstairs, one downstairs, but NOT changing places toilets"
2999,Accessible - easy to find
3000,On street parking but very steep inclines and cobbles in place to. The Kerbs are very high too from road to pavement
3001,"Staff were friendly, welcoming and service was very efficient. "
3002,"All friendly and helpful, on the phone and in person."
3003,Fab! It's an old railway building so most of it is on one level. There are lots of different rooms - you enter via a Station 'waiting room' complete with log fire. There's a fab trainset that is constantly zooming around over head - so make sure you look up! You then enter the main room. The bookcases are clearly labelled - most of it is easily navigable but in some of the aisles it's definitely advisable to reverse rather than turn around - but that just adds to the charm of the place. If you need any books from a high or low shelf there are plenty of staff around to help. There is a fab restaurant on site - it was very busy when we were there so we actually got a seat in the shop itself and the staff brought out our food to us. Very pleased to see dog bowls dotted around the place as well as lots of seating encouraging you to stay for a while! NB Good signage pointed out politely that only assistance dogs were allowed in the restaurant.
3004,"What a wonderful holiday - wish we were still there. Private heated pool has grab-handle near the steps,  and it certainly made a difference getting in and out of the pool. Actually I noticed that everybody was using it and not just me!  Another thing which we found useful was a couple of small plastic stools in the villa. I found these helped me get into the bath/ shower. One also was very useful to me in climbing into large hire car - in fact we took it around with us! Villa Athena is classed as limited mobility friendly, it has 2 bedrooms on ground floor, a large heated private pool, and the surrounding area is flat as it is sea level. There is decking access onto Coral Bay beach. This villa has some lovely shaded spots too in case the sun gets too much."
3005,Being in Frederic Street it's Edinburgh city centre so I'd recommend taking a taxi .. 
3006,"It’s not immediately obvious where the toilet is. More, clearer signs would be good. Clean facilities."
3007,Helpful and friendly throughout.
3008,"Inside the venue, I couldn't fault the access. My only gripe was the heavy double entrance doors for my hubbie to push me through. However the jolly and plentiful stewards were quick to react and help him.  Flooring is smooth to wheel on.  All wheelchair spaces were at entrance level as were the loos and food/drink outlets (which were great as well). I got a fantastic view - the row in front was sufficiently low as not to impede my view even when they stood up.  Whole track is easy to see."
3009,On site some conventional disabled toilets but also one very large Changing Places toilet with changing table and full hoist system
3010,We got around by using the Metro public rail system. 
3011,Parking on roof and lifts to get into the store
3012,"We were able to park right outside the main entrance to the hotel . In a pull in set aside for hotel guests,  reception took a note of our registration and said it was ok to leave the car there access from here was down a slope to main entrance."
3013,The side door isn't wheelchair friendly as it has several sets of stairs.However the main entrance has no steps and a larger door so people in wheelchairs can get through. There are 3 lifts inside the building for easy access to each level. Overall very good experience as staff are very friendly and are eager to help.
3014,Accessible toilets in store which was good.
3015,Staff were doing a number of tasks with in the store from stocking up to serving customers they were all very friendly .
3016,As this is a pedestrian area there is no parking outside the shop the nearest parking is on St John St or around 400m West down the Main St however these Blue badge spaces fill up quickly. The nearest Bus stop is Jackson St which is a 10min walk away 
3017,Two great wheelchair accessible ‘decks’ with a great beach view so you can see what’s going on! You get to them from the accessible parking spots at the beach. If you or some of your party are feeling more active then there is a great coastal walk to St Abbs but there are steep steps at the start and the end and although the majority of this is tarmac’d it is fairly narrow. There is a beach cafe but we didn’t check if it’s was accessible or not.
3018,"On arrival there was no disabled parking though spaces are wide enough if you choose the end of a row. The ramp is far from the entrance and can be blocked by vehicles. The acces route is narrow but passible if no one comes the other way. Top of the ramp to entrance required extra caution as it was un even. Ramp very steep. Door light but vestibule narrow and inner door awkward. Plenty room within unless particularly busy. Toilet roomy and well maintained, radar key accessible, available from friendly staff if needs be. "
3019,Second very clean and very good accessible toilet in 5 days. Large space. And plenty of bag hanging hooks. Clean and plenty of loo roll. Well done
3020,There is an accessible loo. All the expected facilities and plenty of space.
3021,"I really like the Safari Lounge, I thought it was some hipster bar in Meadowbank and really bothered with it until a few months a go. The first time was for pints a few months back, we were really pleasantly surprised by their selection.   The food is absolutely fantastic, not totally what you'd expect, ribs, tacos, burgers, it sounds like the normal hipster bar food but it's much fresher and taster than most!  The bar is pretty much step free, but unfortunately their is no accessible toilet. "
3022,There are no steps to get into the building. There are steps to get to upper floors but there is also a lift. There is a hearing loop at the tickets and information desk. There is also a hearing loop in the auditorium .
3023,The loo is easily accessible to the right as you enter the building. The toilet is large and there is plenty of space for equipment and carer. There are grab rails and pull cord for emergencies. The loo was very clean.
3024,"There is only one, but it was easy to find, clean, and had everything necessary."
3025,"Step free entrance to the bar is at the back. There are steps inside so you are limited to about a quarter of the main bar area. The function room is also accessible at the back by going outside again, and that is where the disabled toilet is."
3026,"Mike, Tuan and Manix were all great."
3027,4 spaces next to the front door
3028,"The museum doesn't have its own car park, but there is a place where wheelchair users can be dropped off outside and it didn't prove too tricky to find a blue badge space on a street nearby. "
3029,Most of the staff are friendly and very accommodating.
3030,you can get the bus or tram we drove but it does not have a carpark there is disabled parking a a few streets away
3031,"On our arrival at the disabled car park, shortly before doors opened, a steward escorted us to a side entrance to the arena. Once the doors were open, we were shown through. This side entrance was close to the viewing platform and accessible toilet. Access to the viewing platform was via a good solid ramp. The rest of the arena area is grassed, with a few paths. There are various food and drink outlets in the arena area, though these are at a distance from the viewing platform."
3032,Door does not close with a standard wheelchair inside. Door stiff and stuck so unable to open. Only one rail one side of toilet and no room to transfer from wheelchair
3033,"Easy accessibility, step-free entrance, and lovely staff. The toilet lets the place down, and loses it two stars in the overall rating."
3034,There is a good accessible loo just beside the cafe
3035,there is parking next to the front doors - we travel in a large renault master van - plenty of room
3036,"There is a very small ramp to the front door, you would probably need help with a push up if your in a wheelchair. Other access is fine inside with a lift up to the bar area which has a disabled toilet."
3037,The buses to downtown Disney springs are fully accessible and everything is flat and accessible.  The car park is a long way from the rainforest cafe though so I wouldn't recommend driving
3038,Ramp access at front door
3039,"Parked in public car pack outside. It was very busy and there weren't many disabled spaces, I saw 3 I think. We got the 3rd... but it was Cornwall in August.  There was quite a walk from the nearest parking bay across wheelchair-friendly open spaces to get to the museum."
3040,"Not quite right - toilet pan central in reasonably wide room, but not enough room on either side for easy transfers!"
3041,The shop was busy when I visited but you can get in as a wheelchair user and see everything.
3042,On street disabled parking around the venue is plentiful and easy to find.
3043,"Flat, most routes tarmaced, could see most of the birds easily, even went round to the hides with a bit of help. "
3044,"Just back from a 4 night break in the little workshop. A 2 bedroom single storey cottage. What a nice change to find everything you need and more. The cottage is spacious, wide doors, furniture you can move to suit your needs, very understanding and accommodating hosts, ideal wet-room with power shower. Perfect for a full-time wheelchair user and wife looking for peaceful break with wonderful views"
3045,"Fantastic park really attentive helpful staff amazing facilities would definitely recommend, we spent 4 hours and loved it"
3046,"There is a flight of stairs (approx 10) to get up first, then another 1 or 2 to enter, through the doors there are toilets off to the right, then two or three large steps to get up to the main area where the seats, bar and bands are. "
3047,We only used the toilet in the room which was very spacious for my wheelchair.
3048,For an event. the organisers have done a great job with the accessible loos. The are located with the ladies and gents loos and have ramped access. They are well signed and are spacious.
3049,There is a car park just outside the zoo with level access parking spaces for Blue Badge holders. More Blue Badge parking would be useful though as the current spaces are quickly used on busier days.
3050,Has a general toilet which is disabled friendly.
3051,One disabled toilet in rear hall but it is also the only men's toilet. It has hand rails and space for manoeuvrability. It's clean and tidy.
3052,"Pinner Tube station is fully step-free from street to train, many buses serve the area near the restaurant. I don't know about parking in this area."
3053,Café open all day from breakfast. Indoor and outdoor seating. Reasonably priced.
3054,A modern outlet village with full access. A great venue for a day out. 
3055,We were given a free map of the estate on parking - this shows the accessible route and steps etc clearly. We didn't notice any signs on the paths though. However it was easy to navigate.
3056,"Physical space was generally good but at times I felt I was in the way as I took time to take in all the info thus causing a log jam. Lighting is low in parts, some exhibits, even cars, are mounted high up on the walls. General info signs are light green dots on lime green background. Not sure how that would be for people with a vision impairment. "
3057,It was easy to get lakeside and there is a step free path that goes around the whole of the lake.
3058,"I don't normally need any help from the staff as they have self checkout machines to borrow and return books, and they put the reserved titles on a separate shelf for collection. however on the one occasion where I needed help, as the machine didn't like my book, they were very happy to help"
3059,"Cheesemongers is a cafe in Bruntsfield that specialises in cheese sandwiches. It's a fairly small size shop but with wide entrance door that you pull to enter the cafe. It's great for a take out, although there is lots of space for a wheelchair user inside there isn't any appropriate seating as all of the tables are high up."
3060,"The station, being modern, had great access. It was easy to find with good signposting. Once inside it was easy to wheel around although a little confusing as to which platform to head for. Soon resolved by a very helpful member of staff."
3061,Friendly staff and  mostly good-looking!
3062,Having the ability to park the car using the permit from Mylor Sailing School was really helpful
3063,Level access outside and inside throughout the restaurant. Some of the surrounding area is cobbled.
3064,"Accessible toilets were adequate. Enough space, although bins made it awkward to turn."
3065,Every staff member from the front of house through to the cafe staff were fantastic. Really pleased with the service. 
3066,Toilets have changing table and lots of handrails etc. The area is quite restrictive space-wise as a result of the amount of adaptations included.
3067,"We have never had any issues with accessibility in ikea - parking spot on, all floors even, spacious, disabled toilets and large variety of seating and tables in restaurant."
3068,"Good access to the whole park. Some activities can't be accessed but you can do the roller coaster and an excellent 1km treetop trail. Cafe access is fine, as are the toilets."
3069,The staff were wonderful very helpful and friendly cannot do enough to help. 
3070,"There was an accessible toilet which required a radar key. A member of staff wheeled me from where I was sitting to the loo, went to get a key and then waited to return me to my seat. It wasn't the cleanest but good otherwise. if you needed to transfer to the loo, you'd have to move a bin. The red cord was good."
3071,One Accessible toilet Plenty of handrails Space to turn a wheelchair Alarm call bell Doubles up as baby change area 
3072,The toilets are separate from the cathedral and are in a new block near to where you park within the grounds. Enough room to manoeuvre.
3073,N/A. Staff did their job but nothing to write home about.
3074,"There is a ramp on the left hand side, when you face the church. Then there is a small ramp to the entrance. Once inside the church is level. There are fixed rows of bench seating with back support and foot rests."
3075,"Myself and my friend Megan visited Greggs for a light bite and were not impressed by our experience. Firstly, its was very busy with the queue going out the door with no room to manoeuvre. When approaching the refrigerated foods, the reaching levels were not accessible as well as at the counter level and it was very fast paced service- too rushed, makes it very stressful. Then, going to the seated area, it was extremely cramped and inaccessible. Furthermore, when Megan needed the toilet, she had to get a code to enter which yet again was out of reaching distance! Overall, we would not recommend to any individual especially by themselves in a wheelchair to go to Greggs. "
3076,"The shop, café and wine tasting room is on a platform and there is a wooden ramp that leads up to them from the car park. You also have to use a wooden ramp to get down into the wine tasting room and a wooden ramp up into the shop. The shop is quite small to get around if it’s busy but, it is manageable and staff are on hand to help. Inside the wine tasting room there are seats in a square around the room, when I arrived our tour guide moved a chair so that there was more room for me. There are high tables in the wine tasting room but, when I visited everyone just sat on the seats and the tour guide went around with each bottle of wine.  The wine tour is all mainly on the level access apart from when you get to the bottling room. Here there are a few steps to get up but, a portable ramp is laid down for easier access. As you can see from my photo below the ramp is very steep but, my friend was able to help me up and down. Staff are also on hand to help. Comfort seating is provided throughout the guided part of the tour for anyone customers who are unable to walk and stand for 45 minutes."
3077,"wheelchair accessible cafe, although menu's only available on wall. wheelchair accessible tropical greenhouses. Disabled parking. Free maps to see what parts of the  garden are accessible. lots of out door seating and picnic tables. Assistance Dogs  welcome."
3078,The staff were very friendly and helpful. The were apologetic about the lack of facilities and spoke about how there was work being done at the museum  at the moment was being done to improve facilities for people with disabilities
3079,"This accessible lodge was amazing. Exceptionally well equipped for people with disabilities without a clinical feel, also friendly and very helpful owners. Basically can't praise it enough."
3080,Loved Shetland Museum - very accessible and gave great insight into Shetland life - historical and up to the present day.
3081,"Although not perfect (needed more handrails in shower, front door of hotel very tricky in wheelchair etc), this was a good place to stay.  It was reasonably priced, had good food and allowed me to take my dog (dogs allowed in rooms, bar but not restaurant).  Accessible room nearest to road and quite noisy so not so good for light sleepers ( or take earplugs!)."
3082,There were no steps into the cottage or inside the cottage.  There is one twin bedroom with a wet room leading off it.  It is completely level throughout.  The work surfaces in the kitchen and at the dressing table are height-adjustable via a remote control.
3083,"Ok toilet but after I'd collapsed and had a panic attack they needed to bring me a wheelchair where I was barged to the front of the queue because the people queuing (with radar access) ""didn't look disabled enough"""
3084,There is on street parking in the area for Blue Badge holders. There's also a DLR station that is accessible. Low floor buses also serve the area.
3085,"To my knowledge there is limited parking available near the hotel due to its city centre location. However, the hotel is about a ten minute walk from Waverley station. "
3086,Very good accessible parking bays right alongside the harbour. In fact once we were out walking we found another set of accessible bays the opposite end of the harbour - so full marks for that! Plenty of buses ply their way along the main road by the harbour.
3087,"There is disabled parking at the door to the museum. Easiest way is to take a cab. For the sake of our Euan's we did it on public transport, in this case the Metro (underground) see the sacrifices we make! If you go by Metro you alight at San Sebastao. Do not take ""El Corte Ingles"" access if you can't do steps. Once out of the underground head for the crossing at the El Corte department store. Cross downhill onto Rua Marques de Fronteira. Behind the tall new building you will see a gate to a fortress. Forwa d of the take a left down a narrow street Rua Doutor Nicolau Bettencourt. Follow the red asphalt path to the bottom of the hill, round to the right and enter the museum park via the driveway for cars. Follow it round to the left to the main door to the museum. Ignore the path marked with the wheelchair symbol that just takes you into the park. "
3088,The only one we saw (and used) was a Euro Key toilet at the entrance to the U Bahn station - but you need a Euro Key.
3089,Completely accessible shower room with commode shower chair that fits over toilet. Adjustable sink and supports around the toilet.
3090,"Part of Royal Derby hospital, located in Kings Treatment Centre. "
3091,All of the staff were really lovely and helpful although not intrusive unnecessarily.
3092,"As Edinburgh grew into a vibrant city, in 1890 the Caledonian railway company extended its line, and built an exclusive high end station at Princess Street. , and it’s main attraction would be the wonderful boutique hotel, and after almost 4 years of building, the Caledonian Hotel proudly opened its doors in 1903. As railway travel declined, the Princess Street station was closed in 1965, and demolished almost completely around 1970. However, the hotel itself was saved,  and later expanded to increase the size of the hotel. In 1995 it was made a Listed building, class A, and in 2000 it was sold for around 44 million pounds to the Hilton group. It was later renamed as the Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh the Caledonian. When it was sold again, in 2018, it cost 85 million pound, and this made it one of the most luxurious hotels and an Icon of Princess street. Today, this former railway station offers some of the finest views of Edinburgh castle, and across the road from Princess Street gardens. It was here we hoped to offer you our review. Due to COVID 19 restrictions we are unable to give a full review, but we were allowed access to some areas though. We caught a bus from Waverley station on Princess street, to get off three stops later, (photo 1), to go to the Waldorf Astoria hotel, the Caledonian, (photo 2).  The appearance was very pleasing to the eye, and there was a ramp to enter the hotel (photo 3).   A beautiful reception desk (photo 4) stood next to two highly polished lifts, (photo 5). The lounge bar of Peacock Alley was beautifully decorated (photo 6) certainly had that wow factor, then a lovely staircase led up to bedrooms (photo 7). What a hotel, elegant, beautiful, and certainly worth seeing, an ideal hotel for disabled, although bus stops mean a little walking has to be done, but everywhere in  hotel seemed to be wheelchair friendly enough. Then a long walk took us to Queensferry road for our bus to take us back to Princess street. (Photo 8). Our final thoughts. We were disappointed not to see more of the hotel, but the parts we were able to see was spotless, shiney, elegant, and you certainly felt in there that you needed to dress up. But my wheelchair and I were warmly welcomed, and we already felt we would recommend this hotel, though it would be pricey (example, from £370 a night and upwards, during September 2021). But my, would you enjoy your visit."
3093,very helpful
3094,Flat access to all pitches 
3095,Accessible loo off the shop (doubled as baby change) was somewhat cramped - especially with a carer - and the toilet itself was low.
3096,A wheelchair accessible appliance shop in Falkirk Retail Park. Very convenient shop in town with level access and wheelchair accessible customer lift inside.
3097,"There was plenty parking that has to be paid for at the machine as you leave. This includes blue badge holders, although it is not expensive. The car park is approx 100 yards from the floating village. For those with passengers unable to walk that distance there is a drop off point at the floating village."
3098,Not really needed any staff except in the Shopmobility and they are very helpful. There is a customer service desk at the Centre point of the mall if you tequire help. Also patrolling security guards should you need someone 
3099,"The disabled access to the main part of grand central is mainly via lifts from the train station, however there are also connectors from the bullring and the city centre that are via ramps or flat surfaces, meaning they are easily accessible.  There is shopmobility available for people to use when they visit grand central via the main car park, am unsure if there is a cost attached as did not personally use during our visit.  Grand central is a flat surface with seating and places to rest should people require it. "
3100,"Really a five star bathroom/wet room, so spacious and clean. Included everything from shower chair, grab rails, lowered sink etc. "
3101,"There is a disabled toilet with the drop-down rail and wall mounted grab rails. The door also has a horizontal rail, the toilet is a good size and the staff nearly always help you with the door"
3102,Staff were friendly and welcoming. I raised with staff that the emergency cord was short and asked her to follow this up. On this occasion I didn't require assistance but previously staff have been helpful when I've needed help with carrying my tray.
3103,"All capable and willing, but not always as open as could be, but no problems with this."
3104,"The pub opened earlier this year and we've recently been in a few times, and it's very hit and miss. If you have sensory needs this is a lovely place, the lighting is low and the music (when I have been in) has been very low as well. They have a cat and allow dogs in the pub so that makes it feel more homely. My main problem was that there is no disabled toilet. I went in on crutches and couldn't find the accessible loo and was told there wasn't one ""as everything is on the ground floor"". With one crutch I really struggled to use the toilet as it was one of those narrow one toilet rooms. They have a ramp on order for wheelchair users but unless you are able to stand to walk a few steps and leave your wheelchair in the hall, I wouldn't bother. Our first visit the bartender was super friendly and put up with my autistic questions about the cat. Our second visit the bartender was very grumpy looking and just didn't seem to want to be there.  In short, would recommend for a quiet drink from time to time but not if you have physical disabilities."
3105,"despite having rung the pub and asked about step-free access, there were 2 shallow steps at the front. Level access from the rear but the doorway was too narrow for the wheelchair"
3106,I've always rated this zoo as the best in the UK and I feel it has now begun to seriously include access for wheelchair users. Perhaps more could be done for visually impaired people who require tactile navigation or tactile models.
3107,Public transport is very convenient. It has disabled access and the nearest bus stop is 0.2 miles away. 
3108,Staff were really helpful
3109,"When I arrived there was only 1 member of staff at receiption and there was quite a long queue. Eventually a second member of staff arrived. As mentioned above I had to wait to be served. The member of staff was polite and helpful. The issue was not the staff themselves but the level of staffing.  Receiption were very helpful, when I left I forgot to pack my phone charger and I phoned up the hotel, they checked my room there and then and posted it out to me at no additional cost."
3110,"The members of staff I spoke to were friendly, and asked me about my day. "
3111,"The staff are very welcoming & friendly. No one was phased by the wheelchair, & the staff spoke to both me & my husband. No one was condescending or patronising, & one waiter in particular went out of their way to be inclusive."
3112,Wheelchair accessible restaurant with good food and disabled facilities.
3113,"There was plenty of parking outside the hotel, including several blue badge spaces. The hotel's accessible shuttle bus into the centre of Killarney worked well for my small scooter, and I understand this bus also goes to the local station, although I don't know about the access there. "
3114,"Frizzante is an Italian restaurant, offering a delicious selection of pasta, pizza and meat and fish dishes. They layout includes a single step at the entrance, there are several booths with fixed seating but at the back there is a large room with free standing tables and chairs."
3115,"I understand another reviewer wasn't keen on the accessible loos, but the one I went to near the lorrikeet house was clean and spacious, with enough grab handles."
3116,"This 17th century Coaching Inn, Greswolde Arms, was originally named “the Mermaid Inn”. It was later bought by the Greswolde family in the early 1700’s, and remained with the family for the next 200 years. The oldest part was a timber framed structure, with steep gables. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was extended and renovated to expand its coaching trade, as this was a major stop on the Birmingham to London route.  It is positioned nicely in the lovely old picturesque High street of Knowle, Solihull, (see our REVIEW for Knowle, Solihull) having played a main role in Knowle village over the years. Lady Byron, wife of poet Lord Byron, enjoyed a visit here, and the Beatles stayed here in 1963.  The 3 star hotel has a carpark (free for guests) with 33 modern decorated bedrooms, With one being a disabled room. It has a beer garden, and is a dog friendly hotel.  READ OUR REVIEW  The walk across from carpark is level enough and only a short walk, (4) and looks inviting, with many attractively filled tubs of mainly evergreen shrubs (5) with plenty of outdoor furniture to allow sunny warm day visits (6). There is a ramp available to the left of main entrance (7) and then it’s all on the level for you. A plain simple reception desk invites you to book in if you have an overnight stay (8)  With the bedrooms quite close to reception (9) and these are of a reasonable size, very clean and attractive enough looking (10). The bar awaits you (11) small but in an interesting corner of hotel (12) which heads you into the large open spaced restaurant (photo 13) with simple wooden table and chairs (14) and quieter spots can be found with space to put wheelchairs (15). In a corner spot is the entry for toilets (16) which has a disabled toilet (17)  which is basic,  clean, well maintained, with grab rails, and you could spin chair around in there. Then it’s back outside again following your coffee break, or something more appealing perhaps, and we suggest you take a short stroll along High street, before returning to car park.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS An attractive looking place that invites you to go in. Spacious inside with room for wheelchair to move around. No lounge however to simple sit and relax, you have to sit at tables. Friendly, but nothing outstanding, but still worth dropping in for a visit over a drink or two, or for a meal."
3117,"Staff were friendly and helpful, suggesting options for our guests to buy."
3118,"A modern building, so access should be good, and it is.  Staff meet you at the door and ask if you want to stay in your wheelchair or transfer.  They have movable bench seats and quickly find a table that is convenient and comfortable."
3119,Great. We went to check out a Vintage Fair. There's step free access into the Assembly Rooms and a large lift to take you to different floors. There's also good signage throughout with Braille too.
3120,Access is via lifts there are 2 that take you to the cinema foyer. 
3121,Buchanan Street is a pedestrian area. There are nearby bus links and stations.
3122,Disabled Parking at door.   
3123,"Not all staff aware of the issues of for disabled visitors.  When a crutches user I was told the overflow parking was ""only about 500m away""."
3124,Some on street parking nearby. Accessible buses pass nearby along the Shore.
3125,"A gentle ramp brings you to the main entrance at the front of the museum. There are ramps where needed throughout the museum, and excellent lifts to all locations. Because it's an old building, the lifts are a bit complex - not every lift goes to every floor, but staff know the lift configurations well and are very happy to advise you, and even escort you to the nearest lift.   The museum has a stock of wheelchairs which you can borrow while you're there (free of charge), just help yourself. You can also book these wheelchairs in advance. See my photo below."
3126,Exceptional. Very welcoming and keen to help.
3127,Plenty of parking facilities close to the activity park. 
3128,See above. Fine with blue badge.
3129,Superb signage in and around venue with level access throughout - but the exterior door is heavy and the entrance is rather awkward (narrow).
3130,"Level access, plenty of space to get around."
3131,I have been here several times before Four family Occasions and it has become one of my favourite restaurants in the area. On this occasion I went to celebrate my birthday in March. 
3132,Walking distance from Waterloo which is accessible on the Jubilee Line. Not sure about parking.
3133,"Very good access, although there are a couple of low steps and  a two sets of double doors"
3134,"Completely accessible gardens and also restaurants and shopping area. In fact accessible everywhere. Might be different in the wetter the garden but there would be still enough places to go round.  The staff are all very good as well. The lady on the ticket desk actually spoke to me and explained everything as this was our first visit, but it won’t be our last"
3135,Limited on street parking due to one lane of the road being closed in places.
3136,"There is no ramp or steps, level access in to the cafe with a wide door frame."
3137,Yes
3138,The hotel does have three accessible rooms. Unfortunately at the time of reviewing building works was taking place which prevent access to the reception and in turn the lifts to the rooms. The building works are scheduled for completion in mid March 2016
3139,Straightforward level access. Doors are quite heavy but staff came to open them when they saw us coming.
3140,There is one standard disabled toilet and a larger disabled toilet with changing facilities. There is separate baby changing but parents still use the disabled toilet. The larger disabled toilet you need a Radar Key for  but the standard one you do not. Halfway through the tour there is also a disabled toilet. There is also a disabled toilet in the outside bit.
3141,The staff I met were very helpful and friendly. It was good to be able to discuss what facilities were available to help disabled guests.
3142,"Musée Matisse is an art gallery devoted to the works of Henri Matisse, who lived in Nice from 1917 until his death in 1954. It is one of, if not the largest collection of his work, which includes painting, sculpture as well as his personal affects. The museum is housed in a villa in the grounds of a park. Overall access is good but could improve."
3143,"There is flat access via two different entrances, with a variety of terrain types.  Explained with reference to photos:  Photos 2-7 show me entering the north east side of the site via Pepys Court, which is at the back of the housing estate. There is an option of steps or a flat access road, the road is concrete but very textured so it rattles you about a bit. But my scooter performed admirably. I assume the texture is to give traction to cars in flooded or muddy conditions.  You then go along a packed dirt path, over a wooden bridge, and through a narrow gap round the edge of a gate. This gap was fine for me in my boot scooter and I should think most wheelchair users and small scooter users will find it manageable. If you have a very big scooter you may struggle.   Once you are in the site, there are tarmac paths around blocks of long grass meadow and quite easy to get around on wheels. There are benches to sit on in the north east side of the site including picnic benches, but no benches with back support.  Photos 8 and 9 show me crossing from the north east side of the site to the south west side. This side of the site is a grassy playing field and in early March it was quite muddy! I had to get off my scooter and walk it in some places as the scooter was just spinning its wheels in the mud. In summer I expect it's much drier.  Photos 10-14 are taken from the wetland habitat in the south west side of the site. To get to it you either have to cross about 30m of grass if coming from the north east side, or about 80m of grass if coming from the Riverside Bridge entrance. There is a long shot showing the Riverside Bridge and its wooden ramp from the wetland habitat. The wetland habitat itself has a mixture of boardwalk and dirt paths. On my scooter I found it very manageable.  Photos 15 and 16 show the wooden ramp used to access the south west side of the site from Riverside Bridge. I'm not good at judging slope but it's less steep than some I've used, pretty confident it's less than 1:12. Scooter had no problems with it. There are also steps with a hand rail.  The last two photos show views from up on Riverside Bridge. The bridge itself has no steps. The slope is longer and shallower than other local bridges like Cutter Ferry and Fort St George but I imagine it would still be quite demanding to do in a manual wheelchair."
3144,"Access to the restaurant is no problem.  There is a wheelchair lift at the front of the building (it also will take a mobility scooter) - you ask at the hotel reception for someone to call it down.  It is not covered, so you will get wet in the rain.  Once up to the hotel reception, there is step free access to the restaurant.  The seating is a mixture of high stools and normal chairs.  We were taken to an appropriate table, that I could park my wheelchair at.  No difficulty manoeuvering my wheelchair around the restaurant."
3145,"The hotel has its own small car park at rear of hotel, with £10.00 overnight charge during 2022. A narrow side lane just before The Bear takes you round the back. Street parking is hard to get a spot, and main car park for Woodstock is some distance away."
3146,"Staff were amazing, friendly, helpful and welcoming; I felt relaxed and reassured."
3147,Owners are perfect hosts. We've stayed here 7  times if that's not a recommendation I wonder what is! We feel like part of the family😀
3148,The staff are very helpful whenever I have asked any questions I have not had to ask them for any assistance but I'm pretty sure they would be able to help.
3149,Disabled access toilet with grab rails and baby changing unit.
3150,"There are plenty of opportunities to use the loo at the dam wall public toilets, eating places such as Tower Knowe, Leaplish activities centre, Calvert Trust and Kielder Castle visitors centre. There are no toilets for 12 miles down the north shore of the reservoir between Kielder Castle and the dam wall.   All the toilets are wheelchair accessible and are clean and tidy."
3151,disabled bays near the entrance well signposted  lowered kerbs
3152,"There's a large taxi rank at the front of the building and regular busses passing by. There isn't any on-street parking, but there are a few large indoor car parks at nearby John Lewis. The pedestrian path leading up to the building is exceptionally wide and smooth. "
3153,"We stayed with Amanda and Dave for 5 days. We loved the fact that they cater so well for wheelchair users...level access in and around house, bathroom in Zebra room is very well designed, mirrors and dressing table are positioned perfectly. We will forever treasure the memory of the anniversary gift they gave us. We highly recommend them to wheelchair users! Their hospitality was excellent and we felt sad to leave..."
3154,"large car park with plenty of dedicated disabled parking spaces. Flat and consisting of packed earth, perfectly accessible. "
3155,Staff were very friendly in both the reception and the gift shop. Advice was offered on how to get around and a map provided.
3156,Bus stop right outside but not good for car parking as on a main road out of Edinburgh City centre.
3157,"I didn’t use the toilets, but I did notice that the sign for them directed you through another manual door."
3158,"The main door does have a small step up however, the helpful staff pointed out the restaurant does have level access. There is then a ramp between the restaurant and bar."
3159,The staff were all very friendly and approached us to see if we needed any assistance. 
3160,"helpful staff on the most part, the guy in Waterloo, particularly so."
3161,Could be more helpful! 
3162,Spacious and clean toilet with plenty of grab rails.  You might need to move the bin but nothing new there!
3163,Lenzie Tennis Club are now offering a tennis club for disabled people. Great atmosphere and great inclusion.
3164,There is prebooked parking plus good train and bus links.
3165,"Entry into the venue was good. The general queue took us down a ramp and everything was level entry. In the grounds, there is a mixture of surfaces, including concrete, gravel, cobbles and grass. I took my Freewheel, knowing that this would help with the uneven surfaces.  The estate is vast! The road and pavement go round in a circle, taking in all of the areas, which are pretty well signposted. The paths down to some areas are quite steep, so some wheelchair users may need assistance both up and down. The day we went was quite hot and I was concerned about my assistance dog with the heat but there are plenty of shaded areas as you go between areas.  The furthest place from the entrance is the village/town. It took us a good 20 to 30 minutes to get there. Many of the shops and all the houses have steps in and so I couldn't access everything. The cafe was accessible though, up a good ramp from the top of the park and it was well laid out with plenty of space.   There were a lot of things I could access but also quite a lot I couldn't but I had expected this and was quite happy just to do what I could.   The road back to the entrance would have been a long trek uphill and it was a really hot day, so we were glad of the accessible bus. We used it twice. The first time, we asked a member of staff and they radioed for it, but the second time, we just waited for it to come round on its regular circuit. The lift on the back was great. I dread these kind of things as it often means being manhandled or moved around. This was really easy for me to wheel on and off though and the staff were fantastic. It goes quite slowly around the site, so if you've got good control, you can opt not to be tied down and just sit with family/friends. "
3166,Level access beauticians within a gym.
3167,"Again, set up specifically for another individual, but a very high standard and quite adaptable."
3168,"Hotel is on the main street, very narrow frontage. Parking for 3 cars only, but a security guard 24 hours, and if you advise him, he will book your space in the front."
3169,"We love NT Fell Foot Park, not all paths are disabled friendly, but those that end in steps are clearly signed. Plenty of picnic tables. Great views from this lakeside part right up Windermere. The cafe is disabled and dog friendly though access through a cobbled area is a bit bumpy, Tucked behind the cafe in the historic boat house is a spacious Changing Places toilet, the adjacent 5 min audio visual history of the house and estate is also accessible."
3170,Lothian buses 16 and 12 stop quite near.
3171,Comfortable and totally wheelchair accessible. It's one of the few places we've found where the wheelchair user doesn't have to compromise. The High Peak Trail is nearby which is wheelchair accessible as are many of the former railway track trails in the area. Wonderful welcome and the owners go out of their way to help. Have stayed here many times and intend to come many more.
3172,There aren't any parking or transport. Multi storey nearby has no blue badge discount or disabled spaces.
3173,It's central and on Lothian Road so accessible via bus and a  short roll from the tram stop either Shandwick or Princes Street. There is now a drop curb just in front of it with perhaps a couple of centimeters in height which makes accessibility much better than it used to be. 
3174,RADAR key required. Very clean and quite spacious. Handrails close to toilet on left side but there is about two feet space between the toilet and wall and handrail on right hand side. Red cord hanging to floor on left hand side. Space under sink to roll under. Toilet roll dispenser is the single tissue dispenser which I had a bit of bother with but it was at an okay level for me. There is a hand dryer next to the door.
3175,They provide wheelchair vehicles to help visitors get up the hill. friendly staff. Good parking and bus routes. Accessible and education centres. Could have more toilets around the zoo.
3176,"Lovely, friendly people to let you in who are then not intrusive. Perfect."
3177,It was a hot summers day and the cold drinks were calling...and the doughnuts! Fully accessible and just round the corner from the expensive and busy La Rambla.
3178,"Not easy and indirect, Ramps steep and need more maintenance "
3179,Two disabled access loos with good space and very clean.
3180,"The front door at Clober Farm is opened electronically by using a key fob card outside and an automatic button on the inside. The front door is very wide for a wheelchair user to get through and the accommodation is all level access.  The living room and kitchen area are open spaced meaning that it is spacious for wheelchair users to move around, there is a dining room table that is at a perfect height for wheelchairs. In the kitchen everything is at a perfect height and there is an adjustable worktop in the kitchen to allow visitors of any height to prepare food.  There are 3 bedrooms at Clober Farm, but only one with a ceiling tracking hoist. This is the bedroom that I slept in due to requiring a hoist and it also had an adjustable bed identical to the one that I use at home, which goes up to save my helper straining her back when assisting me and allows me to raise the head and feet of the bed myself to lie more comfortably. All of the beds in fact allowed visitors to raise their feet and head.  I was able to get into every room, however the bedroom that I was in was very spacious. A feature that I loved in the accessible bedroom and in the kitchen/living area was the assistive technology panels. They allow visitors to be able to control the lights, windows and blinds.  The garden outside was also very accessible. it was level access, the fruit beds were at a great height and the summer house had a ramp for easy access for wheelchair users."
3181,"Very good food and pleasant and friendly service. The staff speak English, and can provide a version of the menu in several languages, including English. There's fresh produce on the menu, which includes Austrian and international dishes."
3182,"The staff were very helpful, friendly and informative making you feel very welcome part of their family. They was always making sure the children were safe aswell."
3183,The car park is right outside the hotels doors and around the side. You can reserve a parking space to be closer to the main doors. There is a bus stop outside the hotel and across the road so very close.
3184,"I used the accessible toilet on the Lower Ground floor next to the cafe. (There is another next to the Cafe Bar on the top floor but I didn’t use this). The cafe one is through one door which was quite heavy and then you have to turn left/ do a U turn to get into the toilet. Plenty space inside for a powerchair to turn and for someone to come in with you. No red cord though!! Don’t know how to report this, any tips reviewers?  "
3185,"Decent sized accessible toilet, well signposted. Also have a huge changing places toilet with hoist and shower easily accessed with a Radar key."
3186,"Access for me was excellent with fantastic meet and greet folk on the front door. It became even easier as I was able to take part in a pre-show touch tour. Not only did I get to see some of the props, hear about the set, and the story - I got to go up onto the stage to see things up close.   A fantastic experience!  The audio description during the performance can only be described as excellent - with a live commentary it bought the performance alive for me and made it much more enjoyable. "
3187,"New Street has a steep incline, and the ramp into the Weavers Table might require some muscle power, but the layout of the venue is spacious with easily accessed tables."
3188,"The staff were lovely, friendly and helpful. "
3189,A good sized disabled toilet.  Very clean.  
3190,"I am a full time wheelchair user & I spent a lovely afternoon looking round this Outlet Mall on my own. There is underground parking with several accessible bays, lots of lifts, wide aisles & friendly people.  Good range of shops & restaurants, cinema, toilets & a short walk (wheel) to the Lowry Theatre."
3191,Adjacent to bus station. Car park across the street. 
3192,There was a large car park adjacent to the entrance to the Blyth Battery which had a number of disabled bays.  We did find these bays hard to find though.  There was ev charging points.
3193,Staff available at front desk (East Coast)  who provide assistance for passengers needing help getting to platform or onto train.
3194,Very friendly. Just a bit of a shame the ticketing process was a bit of a pain.
3195,The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. 
3196,Very helpful and friendly.
3197,"Access is excellent throughout, as one would expect of a hotel for people with disabilities. Although the hotel is set in a Victorian house, it has been well adapted. There are eight single and eight twin-bedded rooms, all of which have step-free access, as do all the public rooms. A number of the bedrooms have ceiling hoists, and mobile hoists are also available, operated by the hotel's care staff. Most of the bedrooms have en-suite wet rooms and electric profiling beds. Other equipment such as shower chairs and commodes are available for use. The extensive gardens have good paths throughout."
3198,Centre covered by large lifts to all floors with large open spaces
3199,The disabled toilet up on the bus station exit level has a nappy changing station which won't stay closed (its also had the safety strap cut). The floor was wet without signage and the assistance cord has been cut above the height of the toilet roll holder...with the nappy change unit open at eye height for a manual chair user it was impossible to turn without banging something or hurting myself...it also made it hard to open or close the door! 
3200,Whent to dobbies for a visit staff were friendly good place to visit. good for my powerchair to get around
3201,The loo comes to you. 
3202,Staff in gift shop and cafe were very helpful.
3203,This was the first time I'd booked ahead to rent a scooter on holiday. and it went so well I'm eager to do it again. Accessible Madrid were helpful over email before I went and responsive when I needed to call them about something when I was in the city. I thought their charges were reasonable and the delivery and pickup of the scooter at our hotel went well.
3204,"This is handy enough, but a little distance from lounge, but it has space in there so as to allow you to turn around, but it has no grab rail or pull cord, as it’s just a general men’s or ladies toilet, but it’s nice and clean with pleasant deco."
3205,"The quality of the food, the wonderful ambiance, make it a lovely place to visit. However, the step and the narrow entrance to the toilet could prove difficult for some."
3206,"Very good, roomy"
3207,There certainly was a disabled toilet/changing room - I changed in it. There must have been enough space therefore. As I said I discussed the hoist with staff so I'd be shocked if there wasn't one.
3208,"All the staff we encountered were friendly enough, and tried to help us, possibly FAWSLEY Hall hotel needed to be more friendly, but in general all was well."
3209,There is an accessible toilet in the cafe area. This area is through a door which is a tight squeeze but when in the toilet there is decent amount of space.
3210,"All on one level, like i said only screen 1 is accesible but its worth it. "
3211,"I had a reservation here with a group of friends before we went to a show at the Fringe Festival. In our group were 2 guide dog owners, one long cane user and 2 power chair users. It is a very small restaurant but it was still easy for us all to access. "
3212,"First night they were not very welcoming, they were very harassed. I felt like I was a nuisance , I was stuck at the door with my companion,  as the previous gig was running an hour behind, and we were not allowed to access the venue.Drunk  people falling over my chair. It was difficult to see who was staff ( they are all volunteers). I finally got help, when a member of  the catering staff who was returning from the toilet asked if I needed help, I explained someone was to come back, but as yet had not, she returned with John who works as a carer, he was fantastic, taking me round to the venue through the crowd, and making sure we were seated ok in the wheelchair area. He even came back half way through the gig and bought us a drink. Second night was so different, all were helpful and welcoming, there were security guards visible as well, unlike the first night. "
3213,Very friendly
3214,"Four of us,  a support team and a client, stayed three nights. Martin, the owner was there when we arrived and showed us the place.  The house has been very well adapted to suit every accessibility and mobility needs you can think of. It is very spacious, beautifully furnished and decorated. It looks and feels more like a 5 star hotel then ""A House""."
3215,Spacious. Accessible washroom inside. Exterior door openers kept turned off.
3216,Massive car park at back entrance.
3217,Adequate disabled toilets.
3218,"Didn't really interact with many staff members, although the lady that gave us the radar key for the changing place toilet was nice. "
3219,I have never been to the upstairs where there are sometimes events so I am not sure if these are accessible. Ground floor is accessible and allows assistance dogs.
3220,The staff are all very good indeed if you have a problem they will try and help you if you have forgotten somethings they will try and find something for you
3221,"There are three disabled parking spaces at the front, and ample parking at the back. The only downside is staff allowing people to take up the disabled spaces for drop offs, and one taxi waiting for an hour in a disabled parking space. This went unchallenged by staff helping people unload."
3222,Hard to get their attention sometimes as bar is busy and had to remind one to not pack baby seats around where I was sitting as large powerchairs need more than half a metre space to fit through. Any waiters we had were nice.
3223,"Some Blue Badge parking places near the entrance, but these were full on the day we went which was very busy but there is plenty of room to be dropped off if the wheelchair user is the passenger."
3224,Knowledgeable about the artworks and gave good directions on how to access the Henry Moore building. 
3225,It's a decent well equipped accessible toilet. The only problem is that it's about 100 metres from the viewing area.
3226,"A visit to the home of Racing 92 for the Champions Cup game V Munster, my second visit to the La Défense Arena & yet again it did not disappoint, a quality display of Rugby and an accessible delight it’s a must visit for any Rugby fan!   "
3227,This is a really good free museum in Edinburgh. It's a small size but with just the right amount of information to make it really interesting. The museum is all on one level too which is great!
3228,Very poor
3229,"There is an accessible toilet within the Creative Café.  It was easy to get to, as just at the side of the main Creative and Café area. It was a pretty standard accessible toilet, and was fine, but again a couple of small adjustments could make it even better. The soap and towel dispensers, and mirror, were all too high if trying to reach them from sitting in a wheelchair."
3230,Seating was in on the terrace which has a great view. Went straight up to the there via the lift in the main reception - just to the side of the parking in the west stand. If you're using a powerchair depending on its size it could be a bit tight. Terrace is also great as food & drinks orders taken at your seat!
3231,"There is 1 disabled parking space near the front door. It is intended for loading/unloading, but we were told we could leave our car there beacuse it was a quiet day. I parked in the car park located in the old walled garden. This is near the main entrance & all fairly level so we took the wheelchair back down from the hotel. I think there are more disabled parking bays in the main car park, but I didn't go there."
3232,Multiple areas provide choice for wheelchair areas.
3233,"Access here is mixed but it has a couple of access features that most other local beaches don't, and it's a lovely beach for a day out.  First, while the car park is 200m from the beach, there is a road that runs right down to the sand. So if you have limited mobility but you're in a party with a driver who can do the walk, you can have them drop you off 10m from the beach. From there it is a slightly sloped tarmac road and then directly onto the beach sand, no steps. And no miles long slip road or switchback cliffside path! Joy!  Note that the 200m walk to the car park is on quite a steep hill.  Second, there is a beach wheelchair. I have seen it on display to be borrowed and have seen it in use but haven't used myself.  The biggest drawback is toilets. No public toilets! People tend to ask in one of the two restaurants but I have not checked for flat access and I know at least some of the entrances have steps. When I went last time I was lucky enough to swim and so let's be honest, I just peed in the sea.  As mentioned, flat access to restaurants is dubious, I would not rely on it without phoning ahead. (I'll check it myself next time and add detail.) In the summer there is a kiosk that sells ice cream and chips and things that you can eat on the beach. This is up a short slope but I think no steps. And if any member of your party can get there, they can bring stuff for all of you. Otherwise bring a picnic.  If the access situation works for you, it's a great beach for a day out. Sandy, sheltered, small to medium sized. There is rental of double kayaks and paddle boards, though I haven't used them since I got sick so don't know how they handle disabled users. Also deck chair rental. The shelter of the harbour means the sea is normally less rough than at most beaches in the area, and it's a sandy beach with a gentle slope. Great if you want sea swimming in a gentle setting or if you've brought kids."
3234,Wide paths.Good signs.
3235,"Access wonderful, food wonderful, staff wonderful."
3236,"There is a gentle ramp from car park to veranda, however there's a bit of a lip at the car park end. Partway up there's a sharp turn though this didn't present me with any problems.  There's no step into the lodge but there's a sizeable threshold lip to negotiate and the doorway is barely wide enough for a wheelchair so mind your knuckles. Once inside the floors are hard except for the bedrooms. The ensuite has a non slip floor. The biggest difficulty was going to bed and using bathroom. Tight turn to get wheelchair through bedroom door, sharp left down side of bed, get someone to close bedroom door then reverse to access bathroom door. Once in bathroom, get across room to be able to close door so that loo can be accessed. Reverse procedure to leave!  I couldn't do this unaided. There was a small garden, completely inaccessible (steps)."
3237,I've always had a nice experience here. Staff seem very knowledgable on the menu. 
3238,"the train itself is not a friendly one, many time the call for assistance button is faulty and goes of by itself so is often unanswered, as well as the disabled loo doors often needing a swift kick to close. the disabled parking for the station is close to the ramp access."
3239,"The nearest step-free station is Earls Court, which is a long way off. The 49 bus stops just outside this branch of Boots, and the 74 bus is not very far away. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area."
3240,"I thought the loo was excellent although I am not a powerchair user.  there is good space as can be seen in the pictures and the toilets are fresh and clean.  It's worth visiting just for the music that is piped in.  There is also a baby changing table available.  For a new coffee shop, it was great to see this much thought put into the accessibility of the toilet.  Kudos."
3241,Very helpful
3242,"A little tight and must be able to transfer. Support rails and shower stool. Toilet flush on pedal. Remember, this is a boat, carrying it's own water supply so ""ship shower"" so you don't run out!"
3243,The toilet is situated above Waitrose and is accessed via a large lift with two doors so no three point turns necessary.  Two lifts available.
3244,"I was staying nearby so did not require to use transport. I didn't notice a specific carpark, but it is possible to park in streets nearby. Bigger streets do have marked disabled bays.  There are also lots of taxis in the area, and many bus stops. Local buses (green in colour), have disabled access, the buses themselves can lower, and the set of doors in the middle of the bus is wider which allow easier access."
3245,"The venue is completely level and has just been refurbished. There is one lift in the venue which is beneath the balcony in the centre of the food hall, take the lift to level one and follow the signs to snow factors bar Barvaria and there is a lift on the right as you enter. This takes you out right next to DSUK's reception."
3246,Excellent and their English was miles better than our German.
3247,"Around 20 disabled parking spaces are available directly outside the entrance. At busy times the spaces will be full, so it may be necessary to park in an ordinary space. There is a drop off point at the entrance.  Buses do travel to the park but there will be a 10 minute walk from bus stop to park entrance."
3248,"Staff is friendly and eager to answer your questions.  On busy summer days, it may take a few minutes to get the attention of the staff, as they are serving many people."
3249,Relatively good wheelchair access compared to the average in the area. No Braille obvious.
3250,"It is difficult to think of a more supportive venue. The staff are all brilliant. They are friendly, interested in, and helpful to everyone, supporting access and information needs as required."
3251,"Friendly and apologetic, but ultimately unhelpful."
3252,"This was a surprising find in a beautiful, peaceful location.  In a farm setting, several self catering lodges, two of which are accessible. "
3253,If only everybody you met had the understanding and enthusiasm of Watford Football Club employees - that's the dream!
3254,"At first glance the Gardens looked like they were going to be a challenge as wheelchair user. To grab a coffee I went to the National Galleries as they have a lift that takes you down to the garden cafe. Plenty of space and tables outside to admire the views. Going back up you might try the paths but these aren't recommended for wheelchair users as they're far too steep. Note: this does mean you are limited to the opening times of the Galleries to use their lift. There is a pathway to the south side of the gardens but this has a gradient, has several tree roots to go over and is some considerable distance. Not a great experience for wheelchair users.  On the main level there's an enormous Big Wheel with pods that take you and you're friends up into the sky for amazing views, the Scott Monument for the more mobile, a cafe and plenty of places to sit."
3255,"Once you are in the hotel, everything is accessible. But you'll have had to surmount the booking and drop-off problems before you can get in and get a room."
3256,"The accessible toilets are located under the vessel, there are signs and again the staff were helpful. Not masses of space within the toilet, I think powerchair users might struggle. "
3257,Flat entrance then flat inside. Lots of quirky tables but we found one that was  easy to get the wheelchair under. 
3258,"Overall toilets were usually clean. Large restaurants and shopping centres would have accessible lifts to get to the fully equipped and accessible toilets. However, smaller businesses often did not have accessible toilets, nor were they equipped with grab rails. "
3259,"The Signage is Good. There are two counter hearing loops. Neither of them  were working. Staff helpful, said she would get someone to check loops. Said interview desks didn't have them as these would be face to face!"
3260,"as mentioned in other posts wheelchair access is good. i moved the hall table into spare room as looked nice but for us just in the way. As just the two of us also moved the extra seats and foot stools from kitchen/living room to allow extra space. There is ample room for powerchair in the kitchen/living room.  you can even reconfigure it (moveable kitchen island, etc.). very good access to fridge, kitchen cupboards, etc. for powerchair.  Why the 4.5 stars not 5. we stayed in the opal room with the henderson lounge. We need the overhead hoist. we had the hospital bed and a single bed in the room. the opal room is very nice but not much in the way of storage space at all. restricted space also with second bed. the overhead hoist strip is quite short and runs from over the hospital bed to bathroom where it stops. There is a separate, unconnected, strip in the bathroom so you will need to lift into chair from bed, wheel into bathroom, then unhook and lift again into bath, and same on way out. A bit of a faff when wet. Also as the hoist trip is quite short when not in use it sits just outside bathroom door so tends to get in the way.  good shower. easy to clean up. did not use jacuzzi bath. tried the electric shower chair which was good."
3261,"Fully Accessible, Really friendly helpful staff, Excellent food, great music and vibe. They are 100% switched on to looking after disabled customers, food is cooked there and then fresh and preferences catered for. I cannot stress enough how awesome this place is!!"
3262,"The accessibility is overall good. There is enough room for a powerchair pr scooter to get through the door and move around inside to a table. The accessible bathroom is big but the staff have made it inaccessible by putting an IKEA changing table in the doorway. It is freestanding so you could ask them to move it if needed.  The food is very nice. It is also affordable and there are lots of menu options to make your visit in cheaper such as all you can eat. If you are doing an all you can eat deal have a look at both menus as they both have different foods on. The slightly more expensive one has more choice and has bigger portions. If you do all you can eat or any of the X number of dishes for a set price then all of your party have to choose the same deal. This is so the people you are with dont choose one dish each for £3 and then take advantage of one person paying for all you can eat.  The decor is very tired with blocks of old tiles propping open doorways and a broken fan stuck on a shelf. It can be a bit depressing if the restaurant is empty and therefore not lively.  It is very clean and you can see right into the kitchen which I like. I've never had a bad experience regards to cleanliness or food handling.  I did once order olives which are always pitted but recently they have stones twice in a row so I would be careful for bones and stones if you are at risk of choking.  I live locally and pretty much every time I have been there is at least one wheelchair user as it's the only local place that is fully accessible as far as I know. It's also great for lots of food on a budget.  Unfortunately the only vegan options are Greek salad, hold the feta, or hummus and bread. I recently developed lactose intolerance and won't be able to visit so bear this in mind. There are quite a few options for vegetarians who eat cheese though."
3263,Very good.
3264,Staff made no fuss but took us directly to a table and moved chairs to accommodate the wheelchair.
3265,You could negotiate round everywhere in a power chair but some paths in the shingles areas might help
3266,"This is a music festival sponsored by John Lewis - which says it all, take what you want from that.  It certainly appeals to a certain age group, Travis were doing their album 'The Man Who' in full, other acts included Kate Tempest, Steve Mason and Metronomy. It was very much right up our street.  Access was pretty good too! "
3267,"We visited here during our stay in Pitlochry. There was disabled parking by the door into the shop. There is a small step into the shop no higher than 1/2 to 1 inch easy for my wheelchair to get over. Staff were happy to assist with opening the doors. We watched a video that lasted for approx 7-8 mins on how they use the heather to make the jewellery . This was in a room near to the factory access to this room was easy. The only problem was the windows to look into factory as you go past and the samples were far too high for me to see in or access the samples. But luckily enough a member of staff was leaving the area with a tray full of partly varnished items and she spoke with us and showed us the items on the tray. She was taking them away to get another layer of varnish after having them sanded.  There was plenty of room to get round the gift shop, items were well displayed and it was easy to see everything, staff were helpful ."
3268,"Although the main toilets under and behind main stairs were lovely and large and wide (ladies), I think to allow formal dresses, it is worth phoning to check latest info, or latest review."
3269,The staff are helpful as they help you to put your shopping away and help you with anything you need.
3270,"Lovely, clean and spacious changing places toilet in picturesque village of Cumnor.  The CP website suggests it is managed by the Vine Inn pub which is next door, but it is run by the local parish council and there is a sheet they ask you to fill in so that they know how much it is getting used.    We decided to go to the pub for lunch which surprisingly was not particularly wheelchair-accessible, except for the garden.    The entrance was through 2 fairly narrow doors with a small step and they didn't have a ramp.  Fortunately we did, although was still awkward getting through the doors.  When I booked the table, I mentioned that we had a wheelchair user, and they didn't mention accessibility issues.    The food was very good though, although service a bit slow."
3271,"The Card Factory is generally accessible throughout. No bell on the door but it is usually open, except in winter. Level entrance. No induction hearing loop and no Braille support. Can bring a chair out on request. Door width 1000mm, till height 720mm or 960mm. Nearest car park approx 150m away near Waitrose. Review posted by Nailsea Disability Initiative. "
3272,Disabled parking right outside the door
3273,"Very easy, the elevator could house a car."
3274,Helpful
3275,"The staff are incredible from the moment I entered the bakery, sitting at the table to reserve my place was the kindest thing stranger has done for a long time."
3276,Spacious areas with an accessible toilet for power chair users but low lighting.
3277,"The Emmerdale Village Tour is the outdoor purpose built village where the outside scenes are filmed for Emmerdale.An excellent 90 minute tour especially if you an Emmerdale fan.Carers are free of charge,it is all mainly accessible with a few slopes and uneven surfaces but overall it is ok,i have a powerchair and managed ok as did others who were  in manual wheelchairs.This is an outdoor attraction so you do really need good weather as there is no shelter if it rains,or a good brolly !!"
3278,"Getting in was easy as a powerchair user with wide doors and level access. A platform lift takes you up to the main level where everything was accessible. I could get around the exhibition, shop, cafe and the accessible loo."
3279,"The staff had a slightly anxious way about them, but they seemed to be trained in the requirements of disabled visitors and really tried hard to do the right thing - from guiding me to the disabled loo to finding me a secret way out via the art museum next door when one of the lifts I was in broke down (thankfully not between floors!). "
3280,This restaurant is a new venture and they have a lovely bright and clean venue with lovely views over the hills.  The menu is varied and we opted for the tapas to share - generous portions and delicious flavours.  They now have a license for alcohol so a glass of rose was on the cards.  The cakes on offer are all freshly baked on the premises and they did not disappoint. All in all a lovely experience - thought I was going to a cafe but turns out its a bona fide restaurant!
3281,"For many years I have wanted to visit the Woodhorn Museum and with it’s close proximity to our base for three nights, It would be silly not to visit.  I am so glad I did and, if in the area, would certainly go back.  There was good ‘keep your distance’ signage throughout the museum with staff members a plenty to offer advice and answer questions  The majority of the people we saw were wearing face coverings, as were all staff"
3282,"This is an old building and accessible features are not ideal.  There is an antique lift which is difficult to operate, but otherwise it is possible to get round most parts of the hotel."
3283,Lovely Venue which was unfortunately let down by the access into it.  Once inside there is a large permanent ramp allowing access to all facilities inside and the staff went out of their way to do what they could to help.
3284,"There's level access into the shop, and once you're inside you will - if you're a wheelchair user - find it uncomfortably cramped and tight, very very hard to get around the aisles with ease. Some of the shelving units are unstable, on one visit I knocked one with my powerchair and it fell ON me, as well as tipping its contents all over the floor. I was lucky not to be injured. This is all very annoying and unhelpful.  There is a platform lift to all floors. This lift is operated by holding down a button at around nipple-height if you're seated, and it takes some strength and effort to keep the button pressed. If you have any hand or arm weakness, you will find it very hard indeed to operate the lift. In addition to this difficulty, the lift sometimes gets stuck and then the door will not open.   On my most recent visit, the lift broke down between the basement and the ground floor, with me inside it. I was stuck inside it for a long time. The staff tried valiantly to hand-crank the lift back to the ground floor, but without success, so they hand-cranked it to the basement, where I was then stuck for another long time until the fire-brigade were called to carry my heavy powerchair up the stairs, an astonishing feat of skill and strength.  When it comes to paying, if you're paying by card, and you're a wheelchair user, you probably won't be able to use the credit-card readers, because they are fixed to a tall frame in front of the till, well out of reach, and (unlike most such devices) cannot be removed from their cradle. Wheelchair users have not been taken into account with this poor piece of design.   "
3285,"The entry through the door is flat then theres a ramp up to the restaurant (see photo). There are a mix of normal tables are bar tables, in the area we sat in was normal tables, we sat near the window and my chair fit in perfectly. I was able to get to the bar and toilet easily without anyone needing to move"
3286,As I'm sure you can imagine a facility run by Sense Scotland is very accessible. A lot of disability organizations use this place for obvious reasons. 
3287,Very large accessible toilet.
3288,The Wellcome Collection is centrally located on Euston Road and almost opposite Euston Station. Also nearby are Euston Square and Warren Street Tube Stations. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. I travelled on public transport to get there and it was only a 2 minute walk from getting off the bus.
3289, The staff were very helpful and friendly.
3290,"Large car park with a number of designated disabled bays.  The number 3, 8, 29, 400, N3 buses all stop on Gilmerton Road where the store is located and only a short walk off the main road "
3291,"Always really helpful and friendly, would always help you out if you need have any enquires or need assistance. "
3292,"Lunch with PA , Jonathan Attenborough and Sam.  Was a wee bit anxious about eating inside but lots of outdoor seating elsewhere was busy. You go in side doors that are automatic, only outside one worked. That aside the food was delicious and our server was really helpful"
3293,Taking a dander along Lothian Road I found that Festival Square and its big telly has had a makeover for the Festival.
3294,You access via side entrance via an alleyway leading to the canal. The staff then put a ramp down.   The day we visited the side entrance was closed. My wife had to ask at the main entrance for someone to open the side door.
3295,"Level access with wide door width. Decent space to get in with my powered wheelchair and once inside, plenty of room to manoeuvre. There was no problem with me staying in my wheelchair. They just moved one of their barbers chair and worked with me in the wheelchair with no fuss."
3296,"This is a great museum where you could quite easily spend a whole day exploring! Perfect if you love aeroplanes and history. Much of the museum is open air, and access can be varied throughout. But in general, most of the exhibits are very easy to access."
3297,Excellent accessible loo at the back of the cafe. Just be aware there's quite a tight turn into it. 
3298,"There are parking spaces right by the ramp, but these don't appear to be reserved for disabled users."
3299,The toilet was not easily accessible and was not wheelchair friendly. A lot of work needs to be done to bring the disabled toilet up to the required standard.
3300,"Staff were very helpful. Today, I arrived before 8am for my appointment. I didn't realise at the time that they usually don't let anyone in until after 8am. However, the security guard let me in explaining he was doing so because I have a disability. Staff at the receiption and during my CT scan were very helpful and considerate.   The week before I had been there for a mammogram and again staff were very helpful."
3301,Parking is all level and immediately outside the cottage.  Very easy to get in and out.
3302,Staff are very friendly and extremely helpful 
3303,"We visited here on new years eve in the afternoon,the staff were excellent and made a table available for me with out any fuss at all,There is level access into the place and a gradual ramp up to where we were seated,the food was excellent also."
3304,"This venue is completely accessible - tho I did knock half a star off as there is no wheelchair access to the rear of the 3D screen. This means having to sit right at the front & crane your neck back to watch the movie (tbh 9 times out of 10 I fall asleep because of the position my head is in) thus not fully being able to appreciate the 3D effects!  The best thing about this venue is that they do not insist on a Cinema Exhibitors' Association (CEA) card in order to allow a carer enter for free - They automatically refer to a list of barcodes, scan one of them & away y'go ....the carer goes in with the wheelchair user for free!   Well Done Huddersfield Odeon ????"
3305,Cafe Florentin Is a lovely little café in the heart of Polwarth in west central Edinburgh. It is spacious with a wide entrance and there is a disabled loo. They have a nice selection of the and coffees as well as hot and cold food with nice cakes and buns. 
3306,"Overall good , but would love to see more space in the rooms and bathrooms designed for disabled folks"
3307,Friendly and helpful.
3308,I didn't see any nearby parking. We got the tram to Princes Street and walked the rest of the way.
3309,Disabled toilet located outside screen 1.
3310,"The Galleries have an accessible loo. There are others not too far away at St. Andrew Square, Waverley Station and at the Waverley Shopping Centre."
3311,"No access problems to The Grand. It was all ramped, from the queuing area right into the theatre itself."
3312,"Now, I must admit that I didn't use the loo, however there were signs to an accessible loo near the beach...."
3313,"Clean toilet facilities for the disabled, with handrails, etc."
3314,"I always walk, taxi or bus to this station - but there is a large carpark available. The buses stop right outside on Princes Street, and you can take a lift down into the station. Alternatively there are escalators (often out of order) or steps. The best taxi rank is at what I would call 'the back' of the station just off Calton Road. It is a drop-off area with a lift up to a footbridge and another lift down into the centre of the station where there is often a market on Fridays. "
3315,The staff were very helpful and were happy to get shoe boxes down of the shelf's for you if required they were also happy to carry shoes to the checkout for you as well.
3316,"Drive from Castleton towards Hutton-in-the-Hole and a quarter mile beyond the Lion Inn is a car park on the left side with an information board. From Hutton you will need to spot the car park before you reach the Lion Inn, there is a very sharp left turn down into Farndale opposite the car park. From the car park, cross the road and down the Farndale turning for 20 yards and then right on to the old railway path which has flat access. You can negotiate a wheel chair around the side of a gate and then there are no other obstacles for miles! You can also explore bits of the railway path on the car park side of the road if you want a shorter trip."
3317,The staff I met for the illumination and concert event were fantastic and helpful and even gave my P.A. a seat reserved for the presenter of the concert!
3318,"Overall, a good experience."
3319,"Did not need to use the facilities and also as explained in other reviews I am a hoist transfer so can't use normal disabled toilets. However, I did not see any signage for a disabled toilet when entering the restaurant. "
3320,Presume this is good
3321,Pupils from Kersland School have been working on a weekly curricular sailing programme at Castle Semple. The staff are always welcoming and provide a stimulating environment for our pupils to work in. Pupils and staff from the school always look forward to visiting Castle Semple and we could not speak highly enough of the venue and staff. A huge thank you to everyone at Castle Semple.
3322,Staff are very used to disabled patrons from the nearby Rehab Hospital and also from a local centre for people with learning difficulties who visit regularly in a large group.
3323,On a sunny Sunday afternoon the car park we used was full. There is a hard surface car park for around 45 cars but only a few reserved blue badge spaces with no safety markings to exit the vehicle. There is another car park entrance with a few spaces on the opposite side to the park (cafe side).
3324,Again - amazing! From helping us find our way to helping organise the seating on the platform they were just great.
3325,Disabled toilets are accessible but only the ones where you can transfer or be transferred are available. No changing facilities for adults that need hoisting.
3326,"To get into The National Piping Museum you have to use a lift that is located at the side of the building. Unfortunately, there isn't a bell to alert staff if you are outside so I'm not sure if you would be able to visit spontaneously. You definitely need a staff member to assist you with the lift, especially if you are on your own, because you have to close the doors manually. It is a very old lift but, it's pretty spacious, you are not able to fit at least 2 wheelchairs and a few people standing.  It is a little difficult to get in from the lift, the corridor is a little narrow and there are some cardboard boxes. Within the museum it is very spacious and the display cabinets are mostly floor to ceiling glass. I thought some of the writing was a little small, I'm not sure if BSL tours are available.  The gift shop is quite small to get around and the doors to enter the museum at the main entrance are glass with no automatic button.  The pop up tent is accessible by a ramp at each entrance. The ramp that I used was fairly bumpy to use and I needed support on my chest to use it. The tent was not very spacious but, we had reserved tables. It was a little bit annoy because I couldn't get to the area where food was served but, staff collected our food."
3327,"helpful on booking regarding accessibility, very pleasant and didn't rush us."
3328,Wheelchair access is limited at this practice. If your chair is on the larger side this practice will be inaccessible.
3329,"Entrance to the hotel is all Flat and suitable, no steps.  The reception desk is very high and wheelchair friendly.  There are 2 lifts which are big enough for chairs and luggage etc. There are some sofas in the reception area to sit and rest. "
3330,Every staff member we had dealings with were very friendly and polite. My tool kit for the wheelchair got pulled at security as it always does but once the reason for the tool kit was explained they let it through.
3331,"Signs at this station are very clear using white text on a black background. There is lift access to all platforms. It is fairly easy to get around. There is a First help desk on platform 3, but it didn't looked like there was anyone there.  The ticket machines First use are not very good and inconsistent in terms of accessibility across their network. In Swindon they use a Qwerty keyboard with pink and white. In Maidenhead I noticed a green on a lighter green used. Not good at all."
3332,"very swanky looking building, carpets make it easier to career in wheelchair."
3333,A welcoming place with a beautiful meeting hall
3334,"In the centre of town, so good for public transport, but didn't see any disabled parking. There must be some around the city centre but we did not drive and wasn't immediately obvious where it would be.   Very close to taxi stops and bus stops though. "
3335,All polite and excellent. I need to add to this review that I lost my prescription glasses at the venue (😢I took my wig off and must have knocked them onto the floor) I rang the booking number today and they  gave me another number to call. The lady explained she was in a meeting but she would she would look in the lost property as soon as could. She rung me 15 minutes later and said she was 90% sure she has my glasses. We discussed them and she is posting them first class to me and I can send  them a cheque or postal order to pay for the postage. I received them the next day and posted back a £5 postal order. The service was excellent and they only charged me 70p for the packing and £1.62 for postage. I just felt they deserved more specifically as they had saved me a fortune!
3336,"At The Den there is no parking for away fans but the stewards found space for us to park in the coach parking to keep us away from the Millwall fans due to their reputation. It was quite a long way to go from Sheffield so not many disabled away fans travelled to the game, which meant it was very easy for us to find a space. The only thing is that if your club took a lot of fans then it might be a bit difficult so make sure you get there very early."
3337,It was a bit of a walk to the main desk
3338,What an amazing team.  Thanks for a warm and informative welcome.
3339,"Flat, large, clean, easy access."
3340,Super Friendly and  eager to help.
3341,"Not at all what was expected! From the doorbell to get assistance with the doors, through to the dedicated seating area and the accessible toilet was really good."
3342,"There was an accessible toilet which was easier for the two of us to use. However, in a power chair, it would probably be a lot tighter for space and harder to manoeuvre "
3343,Downing Street is accessible in so far as it appears but the security doesn't actually allow you to get very close.
3344,"The hotel has its own small car park plus ample car parking in the nearby streets and Railway Station, 2 mins from the Hotel, there is a 30 min butservice from Edinburgh, with a concession bus pass this makes all the difference and can help make it a real adventure, there other services from Berwick, Haddington, North Berwick as well as Edinburgh. The bus stops are outside the Hotel on either side of the street east and west bound."
3345,"Level access, widened doors and bathroom was wonderful."
3346,The staff were fantastic and they made sure that I got to the front of the stage for the concert so that I could see.
3347,"There is a spacious, accessible toilet with grab rails and alarm. It was very clean and tidy when I used it. It smelt like it had recently been washed during our mid-afternoon visit."
3348,"The buses lower to the ground with a ramp that comes out, allowing for easy access. The wheelchair area at the front of the bus is relatively easy to manoeuvre into depending on how busy the bus is."
3349,Easy access ramps with wide doors.  There are no problems regarding accessibility. 
3350,"The minibus was quite high up but I was given a step to stand on so I could get in and out comfortably. On the tour we stopped at several places/ view points. The driver was very considerate and stopped where it was flat, helped me in and out and would drive  the minibus as near to where we were going as possible."
3351,"Excellent, clean and peaceful facilities and the staff were very helpful. It made a nerve-racking experience go very smoothly. Do note that only the candidate taking the test is allowed into the building so if you need any kind of interpreter or carer within the test centre you will need to organise that with the DVSA ahead of time."
3352,"This chalet has great views over Dunbar and Bass Rock etc,views that can change in a flash. It also has actually got the facilities they say they have. Having been to other holiday homes that claim to provide disabled access and facilities...but don't. Coming to The Chalet we had a pleasant surprise it actually had what was written down. Kay , James and family were friendly and helpful, also willing to listen to suggestions from guests. "
3353,A few disabled parking spaces at the front of the store. Lots of disabled bays in the new carpark round the back - plenty of signs directing you to them. Not sure about public transport so can't comment on that.
3354,"All on one level with wide, step free entrance."
3355,Despite  Edinburgh Rugby saying there would be ample disabled parking - there is not.  We have to use the cricket club's car park which is too small and very poorly lit.  Plus it is a fair treck to the ground - across a busy road too!  It is on a bus route though.
3356,Big enough for a large electric wheelchair at a diagonal angle.
3357,see below
3358,Non directly near the Pier but there is some parking and bus links within 300 meters
3359,"Easy access ground floor entrance, restaurant easily accessible. Terracotta Army exhibition really easy to get round even when busy.  Only drawbacks lifts and changing place on first floor"
3360,"20+ specific wide bays for the disabled - but these are not always monitored. The bays are well marked out and there are a good number here, however it can get very busy and you can end up missing out."
3361,We parked outside on the street - plenty of spaces free.  All street parking in Mechelen is free for Blue Badge holders
3362,"This venue is a little out of the way in Ashington Northumberland - but it is well worth it!  Bus - the nearest major Bus Station is around 15 minutes walk away in Ashington - sadly no public transport is available directly to the venue - but there is a reduced rate from Ashington Taxis. Ashington Station has links to Haymarket Station in Newcastle (about 40 minutes) - making it easy to get to, and all public transport around the North East should be accessible and include space for at least one wheelchair.  Parking - there are plenty of disabled parking bays on the site, and there is a lot of room in each bay for getting in and out of vehicles. Some parts of the car park were gravel when I visited and may cause some chairs a problem - but it’s not all gravel, and hopefully, it’s a temporary situation."
3363,"Parking is very limited at venue car park which requires a permit available from ticket office, there is Rose street multi-storey car park about 400 mtrs away and on street parking close by. "
3364,"Very accessible. While there are some slopes and cobbles which could be an issue for some, there is a  mobility vehicle that will take you up from the esplanade to the main viewing area and cafe, which avoids the majority of it. Manual wheelchairs may require some assistance in a few places."
3365,Buses stop outside (few metres away)
3366,All staff were lovely and were very welcoming.
3367,"Parking is by the side of the road, there are no disabled priority spaces."
3368,The parking space is in front of the entrance to the house.
3369,Fantastic restaurant with lovely atmophere and great food. Accessed via a ramp at the side of the restaurant. The staff were very attentive.
3370,Nice big clean modern accessible loo with all the rails I needed.
3371,It is pretty good for a building that age. A good lift to all 3 floors. The main thing that could be improved is the ramp to get up the initial steps. The current ramp is two separate metal planks which are tricky to negotiate.
3372,"Good parking, but the lane leading to the pub is single track with passing places"
3373,"Although I haven't required any assistance for access needs, whenever I have talked to staff or made any other enquiries they have been approachable and helpful. "
3374,"Double doors, glass but not automatic. Step-free entrance. Lots of seating areas yet nice clear route to the toilets. You’re asked to order at the counter, but plenty of staff around and they bring your food to you. Some furniture a little close together in one corner of the cafe, another large area of extra seating down a set of steps, but the nicest part of the cafe is on the flat."
3375,Didn't use any other loo except the one in our room.
3376,Aright but a bit cramped and out of the way
3377,You can park at the start of the walk beside the Diageo Distillery or there's parking in Burghead itself.  The ground is a bit rough where you park though as I'm not sure that it's actually an official car-park or just a piece of ground that people park on.  We were told to park there by residents and have never had any problems.
3378,Level access and good signage. Reception desk is low down and there are seats around to use while waiting / filling in forms.
3379,Very good access
3380,"Great disabled access, not complaining from me!"
3381,"A very Wheelchair friendly Pub , Disable Parking close to the front door with flat access , no steps . Plenty of room between tables , with a Children's area for food with a few play items . A good large Disable toilet kept very clean , with auto lighting ,  Staff are friendly and helpful  only opens at 11:30 am ... but they are trying to serve Breakfast so may get to open earlier "
3382,Moorland Nature Reserve is a small but beautiful wood near York. Accessible to wheelchairs and small mobility scooter.  Visiting in the spring is highly recommended when the hundreds of Rhododendrons  are in flower. The colours are quite breathtaking. Its is a pleasant place for a family walk at anytime of year and is enjoyed by children.  It does not take very long to walk around but there is plenty to interest for an hour or so.  
3383,Buses stop outside the centre. Plenty of parking and designated disabled bays.
3384,All staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful.  
3385,"Several steps into the front door but surprise surprise they had a ramp which they they deployed with keenness, speed and enthusiasm. There are 2-3 tables on the ground floor which are usable by wheelchair users but most of the seating is down stairs and inaccessible. You are then also, sort of, in the kitchen which is fine, but not good if you want to impress a first date."
3386,"Quite a number of the businesses are inaccessible and the hills are really steep, including the slope to the car park."
3387,"The customer car park is unfortunately a loose stone surface, but there is on street parking right beside the entrance too. From the car park, there is a dropped kerb to a level access outside patio into the chocolate Lounge. From the street, there is a smooth, gentle stone path down to the door. "
3388,"Great access in the areas we covered! Lots of space in the cafe with signs for wheelchair access at the food service point. Smooth floors and lots of room between tables and chairs - any other cafe might have squeezed dozens more tables and chairs in here, but IKEA did not and it is so much better for it! I could only see one lift, however there may be more that I'm not aware of. The lift isn't huge but still roomy."
3389,Parking is directly outside the cottage and there is ample space for wheelchair accessible vehicles 
3390,"Sometimes some of the viewing windows can be difficult to see the reptiles from a wheelchair height, but easy to see all the fish tanks."
3391,"Can't comment on the parking. Bus M48 from Alexanderplatz drops you right by the eastern gate and runs every 10 minutes. The western (Dahlem) gate is also on a bus route. There is an S-bahn station (Line 1) called Botanischer Garten which is wheelchair accessible, but is probably 15 minutes wheel/walk from the garden."
3392,"There was one nice member of staff who queried why they hadn’t just put us in an accessible area. They promised to offer table service, but didn’t come over til my walking friends asked three times and after 40 minutes. They didn’t speak to me as the wheelchair user. The manager said he wanted to apologise. I stated his actions did not show he was apologetic as they would have tried to accommodate us in an accessible area. After making me wait 40 minutes, didn’t even offer a free drink!"
3393,The staff were friendly and helpful. They put down ramps for our group to get aboard safely and were supportive of our groups needs. They let us hide from the rain in the small café/ticket office while we brought the cars right outside to pick people up.
3394,The staff are very nice and helpful. There is a big car park. There isn’t any stairs or lifts as it’s all on one level. 
3395,A bit difficult to find - best approached by car (spacious car park with disabled bays) or by foot (just follow the signs for 'The Lake').
3396,"There are many car parking areas available for your use here, and on this part two of our reviews we tell you about the main car park, but suggest you take the directions as shown on our part one review so as to get you comfortably settled into hotel while your carer takes the car to this car park if you did not manage to find a empty disabled bay. It will be well worth the short walk back to reception for your carer. The grounds are very well cared for, evergreen shrubs provide wonderful photos, ideal for special occasion memories.  This time, if approaching front of NutHurst Grange, take the right hand drive (photo 1) which leads to a large car park (photo 2), but again we suggest your driver takes you first of all to the reception and leave you inside the hotel, while they return to the main car park. A pathway ahead, with four steps (photo 3) led the way to reception and this path went through lovely flower beds and a lawn (photo 4) with a private Helipad ready if you came with your own helicopter.  The path led to the terrace garden (photo 5) and four steps led to reception (photo 6). Later on, after settling in, from reception there is a very scenic walk (photo 7) which led past beautiful gardens (photo 8) and ahead was a large manicured lawn with a variety of trees and shrubs (photo 9). A few yards away is the delightful looking functions building (photo 10) where your special occasion, such as weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, are catered for (photo 11). In the far right hand corner there is a ramp available (photo 12) that takes you down to the formal garden (photo 13) with trimmed hedges that highlight the statues (photo 14). Back up the ramp, a path by the wooden shed will lead you to the orchard (photo 15) Then just return to the main drive and be pushed back to the Grange (photo 16) and then by the terrace garden (photo 17) is the reception entrance (photo 18). Following your walk, why not rest in the comfy lounge (photo 19) while you enjoy the last views over the gardens, (photo 29) with perhaps a little drink, before you either depart for the return journey home, of if you have booked an overnight stay, then rest here before going to your room to prepare for dinner.  ( Read part three review for lunch or dinner photos ).  Our final thoughts What a delightful way to spend an hour or two just wandering around the beautiful gardens.  "
3397,"Excellent public transport links with bus stops outside the restaurant, Edinburghs main railway station approx 50 yards away. With it being in the city centre, parking is a bit of an issue and the nearest disabled parking I am aware of is on Waterloo place which, if you have mobility issues, is still a litle bit away."
3398,There is a very well equipped changing places toilet with bifold door and all facilities for toileting and changing. There is a basic accessible toilet in the cafe. This has a heavy spring to the door and no alarm facility.
3399,Level access to shop and throughout
3400,"Very little web information for the museum interactive experience - a single room that is high tech, immersive and interactive (although you would have to check there was an audio described / narrated version).  Very accessible for me in a power chair with low height. You would probably need 2-3 hours in 'Scramble' the paid-for interactive room section. Outside is free as is an interactive panel about The Few inside. Gift shop, cafe and toilets all very modern. Its minutes of the motorway and has a few hard surface accessible parking bays (which are free). Several disabled people around and about during our visit."
3401,"Bicester hotel is a must visit, it is wheelchair friendly and an attractive hotel, and the health club and Spa follow suit, again wheelchair friendly, so worth the effort to go there if you need a little pampering now and again. It is beautifully decorated, very clean, and well looked after.  You have a 20m heated indoor pool, treatment rooms, and the latest matrix 7 equipment in its gym, and they will look after you all the way.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS. We found the staff very helpful and willing, they will we know take care of you, and it just looks nice as you look around, the small garden area where you can sit and unwind is a delightful spot, the pool is lovely, and it all adds to the pleasure of a visit to this hotel and complex. The golf course is well maintained, and we loved the idea of their crèche for young children, with indoor facilities, and on dry days, the outdoor play area is ideal, the kids will love it here."
3402,The staff were friendly helpful and knowledgeable.
3403,"The staff were well trained to put in place the ramp extension to the gangway, and I drove my scooter onto the boat with no problems.   If I'd wanted to go inside, they also offered me the option of a small ramp to roll over the lip at the threshold of the door. However, I could see that my fairly large scooter was going to struggle with the angle of entry, so I decided to stay on the open deck. If you want to go to the upper deck, you'll have to take the stairs, but I had a great view from where I was so didn't feel I was missing out. "
3404,"At last we found a fully accessible activity which is very well run by friendly and knowledgeable staff who give disabled people the opportunity to get out on the water, such a big part of life in Cornwall, but so often difficult to achieve.  My son who is 25 felt a sense of achievement doing the sailing and loved the thrill of the wheelyboat.  Thank you."
3405,All the pavements to the entrance of the station are lowered to make it more accessible for wheelchair users. There are also a number of zebra crossings to make it easier and safer to cross the road as the station traffic gets busy. When inside the station there are no steps on the platform. There are also lifts and a subways to access all platforms opposed to using the stairs and bridge. Although there could be more signs to make locating the subway easier.
3406,"I got dropped off, but I noticed some limited disabled parking (see photo attached).   I believe the nearest bus stops would be at the Orbital."
3407,Friendly and helpful I would highly recommended 
3408,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd approximately 150m away. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
3409,"Having lived in the area during my time at university I'd fallen in love with Southampton FC in the mid to late 1990's era with the legend Matt Le Tissier captaining an average side at the dell. I moved back to Kent in 2000, but kept following Saints from afar & yesterday I went to my first home game in about 14yrs. Everything about St Mary's seems to have had disabled fans like myself thought about. From easy of access entry doors, more than enough disabled toilets (clean too). The club also can boast the highest number of wheelchair ""seats"" in the premier league well above the legal requirement. For myself (on sticks) their was just a few seats to negotiate to get to our seats, with ample leg room, 3 rows behind the Saints Dugout. The food prices werent to steep either a large hot dog was £3.50, paid a lot more for less. The only negative of the experience was poor parking near the stadium, which must be a pain for able bodied supporters but for disabled ones doubly so. Thanks SDSA!"
3410,"Clearly signed just past reception. Push button sliding door was a nice touch. Plenty of room for me but no room for lateral transfer from wheelchair.  Well positioned grab rails.  If I have a criticism, it's that the mechanism to lock the door from the inside could do with a light or something to show its locked. I was nervous I hadn't done it properly and someone might come in - great in principle though! "
3411,Staff come to the table to take orders. 
3412,"Accessible wet room, easy access to toilet and shower with grab rails and low sink. "
3413,Parked in castle car park. Fee payable even with blue badge but good location and easy to get to the castle
3414,"Nice food, small soft play and lovely views. Accessible by car as it's a few miles outside of milngavie off the stockiemuir road. "
3415,A sunny August afternoon and time for the start of the new season.  Easter Road was the destination to watch the match.
3416,"Once inside they had all the rails expected. No red cord, bin in the way of transferring  and such a tight entrance you had to exit backwards failing the corridor before you could turn around."
3417,Staff when told about lift problem acknowledged there was a problem.  Staff in Terracotta Army  exhibition very friendly. 
3418,"It is a little unclear from outside, but the second (new) entrance is wide and flat, whereas the original entrance involves quite a high lip to get into the restaurant through a set of doors. If you go in via the new entrance (to the left) however, there is a smooth wide ramp into the ground-level seated part of the restaurant. We had booked in advance for 8 people as there are not many large tables on the ground floor. The bar is high, but the restaurant offers table service. The floor is wooden, and most chairs are moveable which is good for wheelchair access."
3419,"The staff in the Wells Beach Cafe were lovely, there is seating indoors and they let you in the exit door so you don’t have to negotiate a queue. There was plenty of room for my scooter and the tables were well spaced. All the usual Covid requirements."
3420,"White Hart Lane is an older style stadium, access for fans is great they have their own entrance and you get the full match day experience as you feel you are sitting within the fans rather than out of your own. The staff are brillant  and cannot do enough for you.  "
3421,"Excellent food , great ambience and friendly staff. Venue could potentially be inaccessible to wheelchair users as small step at entrance and 2 big steps down into the body of the cafe, but they keep a 4 ft portable ramp by the door and use it in a fast and easy manner to get you in."
3422,The stalls are accessible and a great height for wheelchair which made it a very enjoyable place to visit.
3423,"There is a slope to the centre, the fairly heavy door opens outwards and is not automatic."
3424,"Level access to door and on ground floor, several steps down to bar but can sit in lounge."
3425,All the staff were wonderful  making sure that you got on and off okay they also made sure people waiting to get on cleared the door area to let you of first.
3426,No signage. Lift in the evening seems to not be in use so makes getting to other terminal so you can a taxi a nightmare. No signage at all.
3427,Very interesting. Lots of buses & Morris cars. Disabled loo
3428,Very helpful
3429,"We spent a wonderful week at Hope Cross cottage with our son, who has complex special needs. He is in a wheelchair and needs full care from us - the layout and facilities at the cottage meant that this was no problem whilst we stayed there (although please note that you do need to take your own harness for the shower chair - as this may be specific to size and need of person using it). The views are beautiful and it is so restful and tranquil to be at the cottage. The surrounding area is lovely and we particularly enjoyed the Monsal Trail, which was accessible and very picturesque. Ann and Gordon were very welcoming and helpful! We will certainly be back to stay at the cottage!"
3430,Disabled parking bays were fairly close to the front door.
3431,"The disabled entrance also requires you to get through a narrow passage with 3 manual doors, which only open in one direction.  The ground floor areas are all accessible to a wheelchair user, however."
3432,"I used a wheelchair taxi service to visit, which dropped me off at the flatter access on the pedestrianised High street. There is a Parking Area to the rear of the store on the lower floor, with  one designated accessible parking space, and about 5 narrow parking spaces, which are always in great demand. There are parking spaces in the street to the rear entrance on the lower floor. There is a bus stop at the  opposite end of the shopping centre , and a few seats allocated throughout the centre to rest, to access the store from the shopping centre. There is a large carpark below the shopping centre , with a few accessible spaces"
3433,"Friendly and helpful, in Visitor Centre, Ochiltrees Restaurant and the house."
3434,Wide entrance but narrow inner door at right angle to entrance. May be too narrow for some wheelchairs.
3435,"Although there is on street parking, parking in Street Andrews is very limited. "
3436,Toilet was fine but the door was too heavy to open on my own. No red cord!
3437,Those we saw were very friendly and helpful
3438,"The hotel is not accessible through public transport. The parking for the wedding venues is a walking distance from the closest disabled parking space. The main hotel has disability parking beside the main entrance, however these are often busy. The hotel offers a valet service if a guest requires to be left at the main entrance."
3439,There was a grumpy guard at the gate but others were good.
3440,Friendly and helpful
3441,"The main entrance to the museum is on Beaumont Street. There is a short flight of stairs with a handrail or a ramp for step free access. At the entrance there is a revolving door and on either side are push button doors.   The museum is step free. There are lifts to all floors, but not every lift serves all floors, which is slightly confusing. It's not ideal but staff were very helpful in pointing me in the right direction so it wasn't a problem. The lifts are not particularly large, it was crowded when there were 4 people standing in it. The lifts are busy so I usually had to wait a while for the lift to arrive. There are also stairs but I didn't use them.  I went specifically to see the Pompeii special exhibition, which was on the third floor. The exhibition has been extremely popular and is often sold out, so when I visited it was very busy. I had requested a fold up stool and this was extremely helpful as there was a lot to see and I wanted to take the time to read the information panels. The exhibition was well laid out with mainly vertical glass cases. There were some benches without back support or arms throughout the exhibition.   When I arrived at the museum I went to their self service café in the lower ground floor for a sandwich. The food was displayed on counter and shelves, both suitable for people at standing height. The café had a lot of free standing tables and chairs. The café area has a number of pillars. It was very busy when I visited.  After the exhibition I went to the roof top restaurant on the 4th floor for afternoon tea. The restaurant is waiter service. There are free standing tables and chairs. There is also a step free outdoor terrace, which I didn't use.  "
3442,"We often have problems finding suitable holiday accommodation as we require an electric profile bed with cot sides, hoist, wet room with wheel-in-shower chair and a designated parking spot for our Wheelchair Access Vehicle (i.e. Van). Normally this is like “Gold Dust” to find, but Our Bench have it all covered.  We had a wonderful week in Bench Cottage. The Accommodation was very clean and modern and had all the extras and essentials (e.g. grill, cork-screw, can-opener, microwave cooker, hair-dryer, washing machine, tumble dryer, rotary washing line, etc.) that often get forgotten about by some self-catering establishments. It was really home from home, the bungalow was fantastic, all that was required was catered for, and there was ample turning space for the wheelchair user.  Bench Cottage is a well-designed cosy bungalow which is excellent accommodation for the severely disabled wheelchair user. It is situated in a peaceful quiet location in the New Forest, just a short walk away from the village pub, village chippy and convenience stores. Initially our first impressions was that the accommodation was too far away from Lymington to walk, but it only took 20 minutes to reach the town by electric wheelchair, and we did this on numerous occasions. The place is ideally situated for visiting New Forest attractions and places further afield like Bournemouth and Portsmouth. There are lots to do in such a wonderful area and our week was not enough time to do all we wanted, so would wholeheartedly recommend Our Bench and look forward to booking again in the near future.  "
3443,"This review is for the main Corn Exchange venue, not others located in the same area.  The attitude taken by this venue to accessibility is disappointing.  When I visited for a busy event, they had coned off 2 of the 6 disabled parking spaces.  There are two sections to the building and to move between them you need to be escorted by a member of staff  out onto the road and then left to wait until someone comes to open a fire exit at the top section.  The ramp to this section is so steep as to be unsafe and leads onto a cobbled lane.  Although the footpath is not cobbled, it is blocked at one end by a large sign advising visitors to the adjacent Chinese restaurant that they cannot park.  This means that to get from this section of the building to the disable parking, you need to go back to the front of the building and then through the atrium area.  I am glad it was not raining.   I never found the disabled toilet and event staff didn't know if there was one.   Both food service areas have very high counters with no accessible section.  I had to resort to shouting and waving my arms to get service.    I've raised issues at the venue before but have been told the owner is not interested in addressing any of them.  "
3444,"This building is used by the townspeople for events, functions, coffee mornings, elections etc.  There is level access at the side via a fire door, on request.  So a wheelchair user generally needs to be accompanied, so that the people inside can open the door.  FFor eg elections, the door is kept propped open.  "
3445,"There are no toilets on the site but the adjacent, 100m, new library and museum building had excellent toilets including a Changing Places Toilet."
3446,No staff however considerate gardeners/work men
3447,Good if you want to arrive by the modern Blackpool Tram. Otherwise it's some distance from the nearest parking or other transport. We walked and wheeled along the promenade to get here. We left using the Tram which was great as they're very accessible.
3448,Step free access from street to entrance and there is a staircase with rails both sides and a lift to every floor. At ground level there is a self service café and some table and chairs. On the 1st floor is a bar (not open when we visited for the matinee) and tables and chairs.  The tables and chairs are an eclectic assortment of high and low tables and sofas and comfy chairs. Some of the seats are without arms or quite low down so people who have difficulties transferring may find some of the seats unsuitable. 1st floor bar area has books dangling from the ceiling. There are 2 stages Park 200 (seats 200 people) and Park 90 (seats 90 people). We sat in Row D in the Stalls which was step free.  In the stalls there is a step down with no handrail to Stalls Row A. There is also a circle/ upper gallery.
3449,My dad very recently has multiple disabilities and uses a wheelchair unfortunately he was another well enough to come on this trip as planned so it is written from a carer point of view. On arrival I asked the staff many questions regarding assessibility and they were all very friendly and helpful. I noted there were 5 disabled parking spaces. There is a bus that can be requested to take you into the castle as the entrance is in a very steep hill. It is important to note if you are reliant on this then maybe call in advance of your visit as I was told the bus was not guaranteed and was dependent on the availability that day of someone to drive it. Most areas if the castle are assessibility and even more if you have some mobility and can walk over certain parts. For example in the great Hall there were 2 steps down into it and then a ramp once inside the hall. The regimental museum is not assessible as it has steep windy stairs and lift alternative.  The wall walk is narrow and at parts there are no barriers and a steep drop. I would guess this would be challenging to the visually impaired. In summary I think this would be a good place to visit. There is only so much that can be changed with an historic building and I think stirling castle has done as much as they can to make their venue open to all. I have included some photos that may be helpful. 
3450,"The reception area is huge, although we would be nervous about the shiny floors if it were raining. Corridors and lifts are spacious, and the room was big enough for someone with limited mobility to negotiate. The shower had an excellent non-slip floor; although a handrail would have been useful."
3451,Friendly and helpful and welcoming 
3452,Nice bathroom. No roll in shower. 
3453,I arrived by train. The station is conveniently located for visiting the V&A. Parking is also available nearby next to RRS Discovery.
3454,From either entrance it is easily accessible from the center of Disley.
3455,I have visited many times. All staff always helpful and pleasant. Excellent customer service from assistant manager (Nathan) at all times.  Bar staff will always carry food/drink for you with no problem   
3456,"I  always take a taxi cause not sure how to get from Roseburn to here  by bus, "
3457,Huge station to Edinburgh city centre. Can get trains here from any in Scotland plus trains down the East coast to London. Including cafes and shops
3458,"The venue is a great centre to try out new experiences. Scared of heights I wasn't sure of some of the activities but with the encouragement and patience of the staff I tried the zip wire. Thanks to all the staff that made this weekend one that was full of fun, adventure and lots of memories. This weekend was spent with my friend, her daughter and my two girls. Although my child was non-verbal and has ASN, the staff spent time getting to know her and understanding what her needs were and through this she felt excitement, encouraged and included.  "
3459,"Parking is free and there are 11 spaces close to the main entrance for use by disabled patrons, with another 440 spaces all with level access to the centre. All levels are accessible for wheelchair users."
3460,"Good, was situated up a ramp"
3461,"Lots of  accessible loos in the centre. Again, John Lewis wins hands down because there are loos on the top and lower floors. It is also the only place that I have come across that has a dispensing machine for tights, tampons etc in an accessible toilet. Thank you JL!"
3462,"The area has lots of Festival ""helpers"" who were great at guiding me to a good spot and telling me what's on."
3463,"The loo's are on first sight, hidden away, but are in an alcove corner at the opposite end of the restaurant area from the main entrance. Signage is limited but passage to the toilet area is accessible and staff point you in the right direction. In a manual wheelchair, I found the facilities to be accessible, well equipped, and clean. Check with a member of staff on arrival for advice specific to your own requirements. "
3464,Disabled parking for one car available at rear (book via no. on website).  Bit tricky to find but detailed instructions sent.  On street parking at front (not disabled and very busy).
3465,"I gave it a 3 as I felt the bathroom in particular was not thought out. You'll see from the photos, a wheelchair user may struggle to use the shower. "
3466,Car park for disabled drivers close to path. Restaurant and toilets.
3467,Staff are all friendly and considerate of wheelchair users - e.g. offering to bring food to table
3468,Parking outside or up the road in a car park 
3469,Flat entry throughout with automatic doors into reception from the outside. Very friendly staff. Corridors are fine but no room to pass cleaning carts.  The room was larger than average and in twin layout there would be room for a hoist in bed and bathroom (possibly not to travel in hoist to bathroom with hoist legs extended wide). Bed would need risers to hoist. Plenty of room for using an over toilet shower chair but very little space under the shower due to over installation of support bars. Small moveable side table. Very soft bed.
3470,"Not sure of public transport, but 3 disabled parking spaces right by the entrance pass."
3471,"- Level access at entrance with wide doors to get. - Plenty of room to manoeuvre wheelchair in restaurant. - Tables at a good height, easy to get under with either powered or manual chair."
3472,Back lane access and a few parking spots there.
3473,"All entrances are wheelchair accessible. There are cobbles at the Victoria Rd and Pollokshaws Rd entrances.  There are benches along the main paths, around the ponds, in the rose garden and in the grounds of the glass house (currently closed)  The main paths are smooth and wide. The paths in the wooded areas can be bumpy, muddy and waterlogged.  The play park is not adapted. The are picnic benches in the play park which accommodate a wheelchair."
3474,"There was, of course, a disabled toilet but as it was in the same building as the regular concerts i couldn't even enter it with a security person's assistance. She therefore led me to the Ladies ( I'm male ) which was - at that time quieter."
3475,Easy access parking right outside
3476,Reasonable toilet with plenty of grab rails
3477,"Bridal shop in a small town called Cosham, near Portsmouth. Easy to get to. One small step into shop, that my husband was able to negotiate easily to push me inside in my Manual wheelchair. Inside it’s a Big open feeling shop With a large changing room. Nicola, the owner of the shop is so helpful and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Would recommend 100% for any bride to go there!!"
3478,Several accessible parking spaces next to the building. This is a rural cafe so you'll need a car. There will be a bus passes very close by 
3479,An excellent experience
3480,There was also an accessible toilet and shower room on the deck above the cabins. I didn't use the shower room as I was able to use the shower in our cabin but its great for people who haven't booked a cabin and want to freshen up.  
3481,Has a flat entrance at the right hand side of the building. The main door does have a step at the entrance. The main restaurant area is raised and has about 3 steps up to it making it impossible for wheelchair user to access. However there are a number of tables in the ground floor bar area that we always sit at. Be aware that because this is the bar area it can become busy. We always phone and book to ensure we have seating!
3482,Went shopping and easy access and parking but best of all refurbished disabled toilets.  COVID friendly toilet attendant on-site. 
3483,"The doorway is narrow, we had to move a display stand to get in. The cafe itself is very cluttered, leading to the unfortunate incident with the Belgian tourist!"
3484,"Accessible toilet is outside next to the café within the supermarket. On the toilet door it has a nice sign that say's ""not every disability is visible"" Accessible emergency red cord. Tight squeeze but there's just enough room for a small manual wheelchair and a carer nut a powerchair might not fit, esp with a carer and a mobility scooter defiantly wouldn't fit in. Little room to manoeuvre around in, especially to transfer from chair to toilet. Grab rails. Clean and tidy and if not or say the soap is missing Tesco customer services are happy to rectify."
3485,Disabled parking bays in a designated area. Only sticking point may be the incline from the House to the spaces.
3486,Everyone was SO helpful. They couldn't do enough for us
3487,Friendly and helpful. 
3488,A large garden centre with clothes stores and café. Accessibility away from the main aisles very limited especially if you use a wheelchair or scooter.
3489,Generally very good. Some (unnecessary?) diversions needed for wheelchair in places.
3490,The loo was fairly easy to find. It was clean and had rails fitted into the walls.
3491,There were a good number of disabled parking spaces at the side of the restaurant and a few stops in the park too
3492,Friendly and nice.
3493,"The students union is situated within York St John University. It is easily assessable, with wide automatic doors with a button to press to open them, these doors lead into the students union foyer. When in the students union it is all one level with no steps."
3494,Ramp from street level into hotel. Lift from reception area or up 5 stairs to restaurant.   Toilet for the disable is included within unisex toilet.  Doors can be awkward to open but always somebody to assist.  All on level floor. Tables and chairs positioned to accommodate wheelchair.
3495,There is one step at the front of the business. We have requested a ramp and this is now kept in storage by the front door. The owners are very friendly and will get the ramp out for you. The coffee shop is small but there is enough room to manoeuvre in a reasonably big wheelchair. 
3496,"This is where they excel. The disabled toilet is excellent. A large and spacious room, with grab handles and plenty of space to even manoeuvre my powered wheelchair. Every time I’ve visited it’s been clean. "
3497,"There are an accessible loo and it is easy to find, there are enough space to maneouvre, it has grab rails, there are space for a carer; and the toilet is very clean and tidy."
3498,"Our 2nd time of staying at Brickhouse , and we've already booked for next year. Plenty of room for the whole family , including Personal Assistants.  Every bedroom is ensuite and all the facilities are first class. Having a ceiling hoist  for the hot tub outside is the cherry on the cake. My lot  enjoy the fishing lake , but having the swimming pool is fantastic too.  The owners employ family and friends and everybody is lovely , nothing is too much trouble. It is a  really lovely place to stay."
3499,"The staff are friendly, and they amused me by making catty comments to each other about musicians and bands they particularly dislike."
3500,The museum is well managed and accessible.
3501,Cheerful and staff communicated well. 
3502,I was newly registered disabled and hadn’t yet received my blue badge. The staff were understanding and told me to park in the disabled area anyway.   HOWEVER there is then a walk from the parking to the gates. Fine for those in a chair/scoot but with a walking aid some may find it too much. 
3503,"It's generally pretty good. The main entrance doors aren't automatic, but they are large and glass so the host will usually see you and can assist. On the ground floor there is a mixture of seating types, and the space is discreetly separated into a dining area and a drinks area. The drinks area is largely made up of very tall long tables which aren't good for wheelchair users. There are plenty of other options however, including fitted booth style seating, movable tables and chairs, and armchairs. It's table service, so you shouldn't need to go to the bar unless you are just in for drinks. To get upstairs, there is a slightly precarious spiral staircase which I never enjoy going up - especially if I am carrying drinks for friends. Alternatively, there is a bight orange lift which can take you upstairs. "
3504,"We've been here several times with varying levels of success. Sometimes we've managed to get about without too much trouble, other times we've given up. This was one of the ""just get what we came for and give up"" times as they were clearly re-arranging everything and stuff was everywhere making it quite hard to get round parts of the centre with a large wheelchair."
3505,"Great cinema great place to visit to see current movies, only been once but the experience was a great one that I will remember, staff were really friendly and welcoming, toilets were also kept really clean. Also great accessibility to and from the building, the cinema has a full disabled access for customers, there are removable seats which allow for a wheelchairs to be seated, this is available in 3 of the cinema screens.  "
3506,"Access in and around the building:  Arriving at the hotel the large automatic doors opened as a wheeled up to them in my powerchair. There was level access from the street and the reception was the in front of me after I entered. The reception desk had a dropped section toward the end which made it easier for me.  The lounge area is next the the reception and bar. There’s plenty of seating with enough space for me to wheel in and be comfortable.  Two large lifts with door clearance of 110 cm and a depth of 186 cm go to all floors. The lifts were large enough for me to turn my powerchair through 360 degrees.   Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The Hotel had five accessible bedrooms and all of them have the option of interconnecting rooms. There was degree of “wow” factor when I opened the door.   The first thing I saw was a big space and across the far side some seats and a coffee table. If that was what I saw first, then where was the bed? The room was generous with its space and there was ample room to move around and enjoy the space.  The bed was large and it was easy to wheel to either side; not always possible in some accessible rooms. A door led off the room to an adjoining room – all the accessible rooms could be linked to a second room.  Excitedly I wheeled into the wet room. It was one of the largest I have seen. It was 178cm by 300 cm. There was plenty of room to move around and would be large enough to accommodate a portable hoist.  One of the accessible rooms has been equipped to allow greater flexibility as the equipment can be moved or removed according to the guest's requirements.  Access in the dining area:  The dining area is on the ground floor. There was ample space to get in and move around. The furniture was moveable and could move to accommodate me comfortably.  Access to other facilities:  The hotel also has a small gym on one of the lower floors. Not a gym user I did venture in to have a look."
3507,There is parking directly to the side of the building with disabled parking.  Work was being done on the street when we visited but easy space found.
3508,"Bathroom was a wet room, good size,able to get a hoist in with plenty of room. Only down side was no shower chair, although the toilet was close enough that I could sit on it with lid closed and the shower could reach"
3509,"Not much to say, was a standard disabled toilet. It does also get used as a baby changing area, and by other customers (as invited to by a sign on it), but then  there aren't a great number of male/female toilets either. At busy times, it perhaps would be useful if they had a few more toilets, but space in the building is limited.  The emergency cord is now sporting a new 'Euans' Guide' card!"
3510,"There are plenty of accessible parking bays immediately outside of the shop and level, smooth paving into the building. The nearest public transport is about a ten or fifteen minute walk out of the central retail park which is primarily for cars and pedestrians."
3511,"One we saw in changing room was ok, see above"
3512,"Friendly helpful staff, who are willing to assist in any way they can."
3513,"George, our 10 year old, with Aspergers said ""They treat us like normal, I love it here!""    Anthony 6, our non verbal son had a whale of a time, feeding the animals, running around followed by the staff and having someone stand in the sea with him on a wet day for nearly 2 hours.  Our other son Alfie 7 had a great time just being himself.  We got a surprise afternoon off with a picnic from the staff, a bottle of bubbly and no children to go off and chill.   Non-judgemental, with mentoring that helps you see how different approaches can aid everyday life.  The week had structure but activities evolved according to everyone's needs. Nothing was too much trouble and a passionate team who are there to provide the best time for everyone!  Can't wait to return to the best holiday we have ever had as a family!  Thank you, a true gem Kerry Farm!"
3514,Staff were very helpful and welcoming. Offering information and help as required.
3515,Helpful.
3516,"Parking is ok, there’s enough spaces, but no real disabled bays, it’s just take your chance how close to entrance you can get."
3517,"We parked a 10/15 min walk away near St. Andrew’s Cathedral. Also, there are some disabled bays for blue badge holders around the city if you’re early and lucky to nab one."
3518,Friendly and helpful
3519,"We attended this venue to see a show at the Edinburgh Fringe. If you call on 0131 226 0002 or email them at accessbookings@edfringe.com then you can be specific about your access requirements for the particular venue.   We collected our tickets from the University of Edinburgh visitors centre (east side of George Square), no steps to enter.   George square is not very wheelchair friendly due to cobbles. Assembly is on the south side of George square, next to Edinburgh University library. To gain access to Assembly, there is a ramp next to the library,as you look at Assembly the library is on the right.   Staff were friendly when we entered. Toilets are one floor downstairs and venue 3 flights of stairs up (approx 37 stairs). There is a lift (on left as you walk in) for your to access the bathrooms and venue.   The venue itself is a large lecture theatre, however, the first 3 or 4 rows of seats are not fixed therefore can be moved to allow space for wheelchair access."
3520,"Timpsons are part of the chain of lock, key, shoe and watch repairs  that have diversified into lots of other areas. I went in here after getting some photos done for my Euan’s Guide profile page. Having not broken the camera with my appearance, it’s always a cheery shop to go into and listen the staff who work there. As they are close to the Blind School they welcome and encourage pupils and their staff into the shop to touch, sense and small the various experiences in this shop. Quite brilliant, and completely experiential as it should be. They are a busy location which shows the popularity and justifies where they are situated."
3521,"I recently visited Sara’s Cottage in Truro, Cornwall, and I was so impressed with all of their disabled-friendly facilities on site. As a full-time wheelchair user myself, I could not fault their access.  Just outside the cottage is a large courtyard area perfect for parking your vehicle on solid ground. There is level access throughout the cottage, and even where there was a small threshold - for example into the conservatory or back garden patio - this was not an issue for my wheelchair.   The lounge / kitchen area was very spacious and there was a lovely welcome pack left on the side with a selection of Cornish goodies! The accessible bedroom had plenty of space to manoeuvre, as well as various equipment available should it be needed - for example bed blocks to raise the large double bed should a hoist be needed underneath.  The en-suite bathroom was possibly my favourite room of the cottage! The design was so stylish and all of the adaptions were carefully thought out. The wet-room shower had completely level access, with various hand rails dotted around for support. A shower chair / commode was also available. Extra little touches that I appreciated were the adjustable mirror and lowered sink - perfect for getting your knees underneath if you’re a wheelchair user.  The doorways were nice and wide so this was not an issue for me. I believe the cottage is also dog friendly which is always good to know!   Overall I was so impressed with all of the facilities at Sara’s cottage. The owners have clearly made a special effort to accommodate the needs of people with various disabilities - from mobility aids, to special equipment for people with visual / hearing impairments. This includes a hearing loop system, a vibrating alarm pillow and documents printed with a readable size font on yellow paper.  Situated not too far from the city centre, Sara’s cottage is the perfect rural retreat!"
3522,"First time in a while and first time needing assistance. Great parking right out front. Superb staff, thoughtful, helpful and diligent. All on one level = great. Disabled toilets easy to get to.  3 issues NOT the venues fault that hampered my visit. Heavy awkward doors into cinema (thankfully I was on crutches and not in my wheelchair), I know they are like that to hinder light and noise but they really make it hard for the lesser abled. Thankfully my wife was around to open them for me most of the time but when I had to go (well the new Bond flik is almost 3 hours long) an unknown stranger did the honours with the door, thanks again. A “press here to open” button would be a welcome addition. This takes me onto my second issue. Walking (if you can call it that) on crutches to a disabled loo and hearing the phrase “use the disabled it’s closer” is galling. It’s closer for a reason you inconsiderate idiot. The staff member who was close shook her head and loudly offered to take me to the nearest accessible loo, big thumbs up to her and Cineworld, huge thumbs down to the idiot . 3rd issue was the hand sanitiser stations all around, pedal operated when you are on crutches or wheels becomes a problem but the foam that came out was easy to rub in, not slippy and dried quick.   These issues were not the fault of the venue. "
3523,I went to Knowsley safari with my carer you have to book your tickets before you go. Can go round the animals in your own car and saw plenty of animals
3524,see pic
3525,Outside the accomodation. A level walk of a few metres into the cabin.
3526,"Accessible parking is available in the city of Calantsoog.  To access the beach by wheelchair, you need to go around the shopping areas on the north side of the street and access the beach through the road Strandslag Dorpsplein.  Some portions of the road are a bit steep."
3527,"This place is beautiful with lots of plants and trees as well as great views of the sea. There are lots of paths everywhere with good wheelchair access, however, some are a little steep. The zigzag path going up the cliff is particularly steep which may be challenging for manual chair users but in my powerchair it was not too bad."
3528,There is an accessible loo multiple hand rails and two sinks and different heights. It was clean and had a bin.
3529,Small and grotty is the best I can say.
3530,There is one wheelchair accessible toilet on platform 1 it is to the left as you exit the building on to the platform the ladies and gents are located next to the accessible toilet which might affect access due to the space available. The signage is very clear for the toilet facilities. The accessible toilet is a good clean basic wheelchair accessible toilet that requires a Radar key to access    
3531,"Staff were lovely, despite the busy day."
3532,"There is an easy to find accessible toilet, was in good condition. "
3533,"Mobile reachable, live on site."
3534,"Friendly staff, offering to take over products for those in need, not condescending"
3535,"Staff member was actually there for a change and tried to open the door, this wasn't helpful as he blocked me from moving but he just wanted to help and its a simple mistake to make. "
3536,"City centre venue in pedestrian area, so no parking available but lots of disabled spaces nearby in St Davids shopping centre.(approx 500m, charge)."
3537,"The bus station has a main entrance with two wide doors so it's suitable for access for disabled visitors, the rear entrance however has steps going down into it therefore, probably not suitable there for wheelchair users etc. Inside the station, there is quite a wide space inside though it is always very busy. The waiting area for the busses is quite small at each stance with a narrow-ish walkway between the different stances."
3538,"A few car spaces available alongside the Spa, after driving past and around to the side of the Hotel itself, but then there is nothing here to inspire you to think what a lovely place."
3539,Two floors is not for everyone. The ground floor bedroom and bathroom were both accessible. If a mobile hoist is needed it is provided and the beds can be raised to allow access underneath for the hoist. The mobile hoist does restrict wheelchair access in the bedroom somewhat.
3540,"Cafe Rouge is a very easily accessible restaurant, with space to sit inside or outside. It serves French food and is good quality for a reasonable price. The immediate surrounding area includes other bars/restaurants, the Peace Gardens and the Winter Gardens. These spaces are all open, attractive and accessible."
3541,The Royal Festival Hall is just one of a number of entertainment venues on the Southbank. The auditorium has great acoustics and it's an excellent venue for live music. There are lifts and disabled accessible toilets. However the lack of signage made it difficult for me to find these facilities. 
3542,"Except  on the gate, they weren't much in evidence either - it would be an idea to have staff on the road crossing!"
3543,Staff are very friendly and helpful and happy to help 
3544,"Ha ha, is within Buchanan Bus Station, so can't really be nearer transport!  Is also right next door to  large multi-storey carpark (Concert Hall Carpark).  Glasgow Queen Street train station is a short walk away. "
3545,"The restaurant has only one toilet, but that is fully accessible."
3546,"It was great, power doors, flat throughout and lifts to other levels. We were assisted the moment we entered the airport and nothing was a problem. We were meet promptly at the gate both arriving and departing."
3547,"Brittany Ferries are good and getting better, large car park at INAHT"
3548,"We booked a wheelchair accessible cabin which had a hoist for the hot tub. When we checked in we were offered a hoist to use inside the cabin as well. There was a ramp into the cabin as well as a ramp at the emergency exit. Level access throughout and space under the hob to get close. Wet room had grab rails, a low sink, a shower seat and an emergency alarm.   There was plastic beakers for use in the hot tub but I was able to use these for general drinking as I cant lift glasses.   It was a lovely place that met my access needs and I'll be going to other forest holiday locations. "
3549,There is a car park to the right of the building but its on a hill. We didn't use this car park but used the large one across the road which has several accessible bays. There is level pavements and crossings over the road to the pavement outside the restaurant. 
3550,"We have used this pub/restaurant a few times and have always been very happy with the service, food and helpful and friendly staff. It is wheelchair friendly and plenty of seating for wheelchair users . "
3551,"Level access to the inside of the cafe, we preferred to sit outside"
3552,All staff were very friendly and happy to help.
3553,Not very good.
3554,Very helpful and very friendly. 
3555,"The transport is now much closer to the front door, though drop off disabled parking is further than the 50m standard for a blue badge. You have 20 minutes of free parking with a blue badge in the drop off area which is not adequately communicated on signage. Just press the assistance button on exit and put the badge in your window. Local tip: have your collection driver wait in the free park and ride car park 5 minutes from the airport until your flight has landed and you are ready to proceed to the collection area, then you can be sure not to go over the 20 minutes permitted. Lothian buses come close to the door but car park transfer buses can be a few hundred metres away. All the parking transfer buses I have ever used or seen have been accessible. Trams are a few hundred metres away, accessible and the trip from terminal to trams is flat with a good paved surface. "
3556,Clean and easy to use. 
3557,Staff were extremely helpful and took time to walk me through the free wifi connection process (a little time consuming first time around). They could not do enough for me throughout my visit.
3558,Used York Shopmobilty to hire a scooter and they provided their own parking spaces in Piccadilly car par.  Scan blue badge on exit and parking is free.
3559,"Although entered and left backwards, staff were happy to move a chair to allow us into the table with the wheelchair. Usual strip at door, meant going in and out backwards, which was easy to do. Disabled facilities were roomy. Staff really helpful and patient. Will be back. Food was good too. Children's area too. "
3560,"Staff were very welcoming and friendly. I spoke to the person on the reception desk, who was very helpful in providing me with directions to the accessible toilet. I also told her that I was doing a review for Euan's Guide and we had a discussion about the good access round the museum and she made a note about the Wellcome's Changing Places toilet and my comments about having seating with back support and arms. I felt there was a genuine wish to be accessible and inclusive."
3561,"Access into both the clubhouse and onto the courts is absolutely fantastic! There are wide gates onto the courts and wide doors and corridors in the clubhouse, making it so easy to get around. There is also a lowered section of the bar making it easy to purchase drinks after a session - a really nice touch!"
3562,Considering this hotel is on Princes St they have done a good job on access there is a step at the front door however there is an assist button if you need help. They have a ramp that they can put  down. There is a wheelchair lift to cover the 4 or 5 steps up to the entrance lobby. From this area you take any of the two lifts to the first floor reception area. This is the location of the restaurant and bar area as well.
3563,"Great overall, but so disappointing that the crew could not find the ramp for my son to access the outside deck - he missed the view of the receding mainland and the sea....had to stay inside all trip,"
3564,"Though the centre supplies wheelchairs for visitors, there are significantly more wheelchairs available than there are disabled parking spaces. The garden centre is relatively small (comparing with its Christchurch sister centre) and some corridors are tight for a wheelchair. The cafe is particularly difficult with  tables crammed in to make the most of the small area. There is also a particularly troublesome door between the cafe and outside - heavy door, narrow space and one of those tricky 1cm lips that always catch the front wheels of a manual wheelchair. "
3565,"On streets car parking is very limited, but there is a large car park at Giffnock train station just around the corner. As well as the train there are bus stops going North and South close by. "
3566,Every staff member that I spoke to could not have been any nicer. The organisers of the Enchanted Forest provide training to all the stewards for different scenario and one being regarding disability awareness. 
3567,Crossing the railway line via the gate is much easier than it sounds.
3568,"The accessilble wetroom is perfect, it is designed very nicely, like you are in a hotel. The toilet has grab rails at either side, the sink is a great level for when you are in a wheelchair, non slip floor and there is a wheelchair shower chair to use too. Very spacious, which is just what we need! "
3569,"The venue has level access and doors wide enough to allow a powerchair to pass through. Inside however there was not a great deal of space, meaning I was confined to one corner of the room throughout my time there. "
3570,Automatic doors at the entrance with adjacent blue badge parking.
3571,"The cafe and shop are fully wheelchair accessible, as is the courtyard outside.  There is also a park which has been added to since last time we visited, we didn't actually go in as it was so busy, there did not appear to be any wheelchair accessible equipment but there was a birds nest swing and a sandpit if you are able to lift your child out of their chair."
3572,Got here from the subway - 4 minute walk. Same distance from Botanics.
3573,I got there on my mobility scooter.  There isn't dedicated parking but there is a bus stop just outside and on-street parking.
3574,"I believe it has disabled parking, however I have not used it. Transport connections from Farringdon Tube station (about 15 min push) and bus routes is very good."
3575,"Staff were very friendly and welcoming. I kept going back there for breakfast and they would chat and ask me how my day had been. The cafe is waiter service but you pay at the counter, and when I would go there someone would ensure that I didn't have to wait to be served. I had previously visited here in 2016 when I was last in Nice. I will definately return "
3576,The normal size. I have not seen a changing room there. 
3577,"There are 3 disabled parking bays at the rear of the building and ramped entrance to reception from there. Doors are heavy, however, and assistance may be required to open them."
3578,Very close to Kirkcaldy train station
3579,Very helpful and friendly.
3580,Very friendly and helpful and tried to find the best table they could for my wheelchair.
3581,The Fochabers Institute has its own car park with a few disabled spaces. 
3582,Plenty of disabled parking close to the entrance/exit. 
3583,"Staff were very nice and helpful once we were seated. Although I did notice someone saw us struggling to open the doors when we arrived and didn’t offer to help, maybe they were doing something else though. "
3584,Staff seemed friendly but they lose several stars for making the shop such a wheelchair-unfriendly place.
3585,Everyone was very helpful and friendly.
3586,"Entrance into hotel is through double doors, one of which was closed and I was unable to get through the one door so had to ring the bell for assistance and wait for someone to come downstair and Unlock the door. Once in, you're met by a staircase but to the side of that, you go along a narrow corridor and to the left is a small lift that takes you upstairs. The restaurant is located on level L (lobby). The restaurant itself was very spacious with good space between tables."
3587,Large accesible loo just beside the bar
3588,I enjoyed it. The trampolines were good. Staff were great. Great day.
3589,It's flat into the restaurant and although it's in the basement there is a wheelchair lift next to the stairs. Once down everything is on the one level.
3590,You can opt to travel the length of the lights by taking a tram or driving. Otherwise choose to walk a section of the illuminations by taking a stroll along the prom. It's level access and you can join from several points.
3591,"There were only 6 disabled spaces, it was a busy time 8pm on a Friday night and all the spaces were full.  We had difficulty parking in the nearest standard space as it was too small and far away from entrance. Lots more disabled spaces needed"
3592,"Crathes Castle is easily a five star visit for so many reasons. I am reviewing from my perspective as a visually impaired person and I had a great time! Lot's to see, to do and to experience. All combined with a warm welcome ..."
3593,Staff are all extremely helpful and friendly 
3594,Lots of toilets available which were accessible. Had everything I needed.
3595,There was plenty parking spaces at front entrance. A mini bus fitted to take a number of wheelchairs was there and also vehicles for taking a single wheelchair  I drove there but for people travelling by train help was on hand at the nearby station and the Lruchie minibus picked people up
3596,"Seriously amazing people, and so kind. "
3597,"I thought everything would be great once we were inside the parks but actually it was really inaccessible. Almost a complete lack of drop kerbs, very little access into rides and no automatic opening doors to help me get into places on my own.  However everything Harry Potter has been designed much much better and was completely accessible and a pleasure to go around."
3598,The car park only has 2 spaces for blue badge owners so I would advise to go early if you would like to make use of these. However there is a drop off point at the front door to make the venue more accessible. It is asked that you contacted the box office in advance of using this facility. 
3599,"Clea, roomy accessible loo"
3600,Lots of paid parking of good quality. Disabled bays few and far between but city is not designed around cars. Shopmobility free scooter and wheelchair use available. 
3601,We arrived by cruise ship and took the local bus =£5 return. All buses accessible and drivers friendly and helpful with putting the ramp out. 
3602,I attended the 'Dear Europe' event organised by the National Theatre of Scotland on the day that we were supposed to Brexit.  It was a mix of celebration and sadness of cultures and identities and views about the possible future for all of us and what it could hold.  The venue was perfect for this event as it encapsulated changing identities; it was a huge old warehouse space transformed into an events space with several screens.  I absolutely loved all of the performances but especially the multi-sensory 'Death Becomes Us' and 'Moving Through Shadows' 'Cadaver Police' and 'Second Citizen'.  Staff were very welcoming and helpful both inside and outside the venue and I was made to feel just as much a part of the audience as everyone else free to immerse myself in the brilliant performances. There was also an adjacent bar (Acid Bar) which had a disabled toilet and a private car park with plenty of room was made available for us.
3603,We were given a separate key for the rear entrance which has a ramp to the door from the main square.
3604,"The main hotel entrance has a few disabled bays, quite close to the main door, although your carer will have to push you along to get to the doors, which has an automatic door to one side of the revolving main door.  It is level to get to it, and thereafter, throughout the main hotel, it is all on the level for you, with lifts provided."
3605,All on the flat and directed by stewards right onto platform.
3606,"The staff are amazing, helpful and friendly and added to the experience!"
3607,Flat entrance with automatic disable doors
3608,Accessible. Staff on hand if any help needed. Even a coffee stand within station. 
3609,"Good signs, impossible to get lost."
3610,Parking on site is free 
3611,"I don't usually wax lyrical about toilets but these are great.  They are very accessible, 20p to enter, very clean and everything is electronic - the water, soap, dryer - you just need to put your hands in.  I was very impressed."
3612,Visited this theatre several times and never been disappointed. The seating is well positioned for wheelchair users and staff are great. Access to all parts of the venue is good and car parking can be prebooked which is one headache less! Good bathroom facilities and helpful staff.
3613,"Roomy doorway into lodge, not automatic but doesn't swing back on you "
3614,"It's a great museum, but it can be hard sometimes to get everywhere and certainly when you are on your own. I actually got stuck somewhere on the top floor in the museum, because the doors were to heavy to handle by myself. There wasn't any staff available that moment over there, but I had the luck that there came another museum visitor, who helped me with the doors. Disabled toilet which I used was too small, badly accessible and didn't have a bin. The food in the restaurant was lovely and the staff was very helpfull over there."
3615,"Good access, easy to get around with a lift to the upper level."
3616,"There was level access, but some additional signage would be helpful. Here-to-help ambassadors were plentiful and offer support as needed."
3617,Outstanding and always very helpful!
3618,"We used Metrolink.  Plenty of free spaces at the tram stop, and trams really accessible (but busy on a match day)   There are accessible bays at the club, which I think you need to book first and a shuttle bus from car park.  Lots of info on the club website or via the disabled supporters club.  "
3619,I didn’t speak to anyone while there but I’d spoken to people in advance and they were supportive and gave helpful info about the different options for entry and health and safety protocols
3620,The accessible toilet is on the ground floor. It is  large  so there is plenty of room to manoeuvre a wheelchair and have a carer in with you. There is also an  emergency red cord.
3621,"It has level access to enter the premises. The doors are quite heavy and I needed my companion to open them for me, when the staff noticed they came to help. Although place is fairly small there is a mix of seating inside, high tables, booths and your normal dining tables. "
3622,Excellent - really helpful and proactive.  The food is also very nice!'
3623,"There is a shallow metal ramp to the front door with a good sized level platform at the top. Inside the house is spacious, with wide doorways. The kitchen is very large and there is plenty of room in the separate dining room to put a wheelchair at the end of the table. There is a conservatory which is down two steps but the owner has supplied a portable ramp to access this. There is a riser recliner chair, something which is essential for my relative but which is rarely provided in adapted accomodation.  The mattresses on both the double bed and the electric bed were very comfortable. The house was exceptionally clean.  The garden is very large, mostly grassed but with a lovely patio at the front. Wheelchair users can access this via the paved path from the front door, rather than from the conservatory. There is also a level space at the top of the ramp where a wheelchair user could sit."
3624,Parking at the accommodation.
3625,Food to die for - those acorn-fed pigs sure are delicious. Gorgeous decor and tableware. Lovely staff. Lots of room to manouevre.
3626,"Car park was rather uneven, frost and mud made it hard to see disabled bays but it was quiet so we parked easily. "
3627,Another place where we want to grab a coffee when we were wonder around the interesting newly developed area behind King Cross Station. 
3628,"We arrived by car, the car park is very much on a par with the park itself, the parking surface and walkways are made up of broken concrete and gravel.  "
3629,The toilets are fully accessible
3630,"As this venue is in the city centre there is no allocated parking, however, it is located directly opposite multiple bus stops to provide access from various areas of York and further afield (eg. Hull). There are ample dropped curbs to allow safe crossing from these bus stops."
3631,"Historic house, which was the former Governors' House which was reputedly Christopher Columbus visited. The house has been transformed into a museum about the his voyages and the ""discovery"" of America. "
3632,You can sense the history in this place and imagine the 60 000 togad Romans baying down the years.  But what makes this venue so good is that it is fully wheelchair accessible with plenty of lifts and ramps.
3633,Zero access to the gift shop. Access to the exhibition is via an old service lift and the poor operator couldn’t close the heavy doors. They won’t allow wheelchair users to keep their wheelchair bags on their wheelchair. The exhibition is in really poor lighting and has an uneven floor which is dangerous. There is no process in place for the emergency evacuation of wheelchair users other than ‘we call security and they have a chat with you’. But no evac chair or any type of forward planning of how they might get you out. The toilet was the worst experience. 
3634,"Fair amount of space. An emergency call button, which I'd never seen before."
3635,"Ramped areas at entrance and exit points, George Square is all on one level. It’s busy but not overcrowded, when wet it can be a bit slippery."
3636,"This, as many garden centres is very accessible to wheelchair users. But unfortunately since the restaurant/coffee shop have been upgraded access to the counter/food display/tills is inhibiting due to the raised level."
3637,Good staff
3638,Great - couldn't have been more helpful!
3639,"Most areas were accessible by mobility scooter, including the cafe"
3640,All the staff were friendly & happy to help. A special mention goes to Francis who went out of his way to help us. He had obviously been trained to offer help in an appropriate & sensitive way. We really appreciated his assistance.
3641,"It’s really not good if you require a scooter or wheelchair. It’s about 6 metres from the car park to the back door where you enter. This is where the toilets are also. Then there is a step to the dining room and another step to the bar.   However, this property dates back to Shakespearean times so I think it has to be forgiven it’s lack of accessibility."
3642,"Designated area, but very hard  to find.  Rough surface.  Not enough room if more than 3 cars turned up.  No Markings at all, so those needing extra space at the side could find a car parked next to them stopping them getting back into their car."
3643,The staff were all very helpful.
3644,Could not have been more helpful and attentive.
3645,The staff in the cathedral were extremely helpful and friendly and spoke several languages. Staff offer assistance to access the lifts.  I would not hesitate to ask for assistance while visiting. 
3646,We didn't have any real interaction with the staff.  Those doing the shows were very good though.  Likewise at the 'refreshment' stop we have as we were served very quickly
3647,Staff were friendly and helpful.
3648,The Glasgow Clan (previously called Braehead Clan) are Glasgow professional ice-hockey team.  Their home is at the rink in Braehead Arena.   It's an exciting game to watch... and you can follow the basics even if you've never been before.  Suitable for the whole family. 
3649,"Great experience overall - the staff were friendly, there was step free access to where we needed to go and there was a good sized accessible loo. There are also some interesting facts behind some of the paintings on display!"
3650,The restaurant is in town so a central location for buses and trains. There is a council car park a few mins away and on street parking nearby 
3651,Plenty disabled parking near entrance ramp. 
3652,Amazing! Deserve a personal mention Reiche and Vicki were helpful and attentive and in no way patronising. Did what was in their gift to change things. Top marks.  I now add Leanne to the roll of honour as she was super friendly and helpful on my second visit 
3653,A very reasonably priced cottage (originally farm outbuildings) 
3654,Pre book your parking space with the box office. Space was right next to main entrance
3655,"We took the service bus from Tromso. A one way ticket is 60 krone,  100 return but you can get an all day for 100. So make enquiries before buying. The bus had good wheelchair access. The is a large car park at the lift if you arrive by car b"
3656,"There is an accessible loo by the cafe by Victoria Gate. Good size, but maybe a bit narrow if you need help from a carer. Grab rails around loo and sink. Alarm cord. Colour contrasts wasn't great - a lot of white on white."
3657,There was a lift available and wheelchair users could get to the majority of the ship. The audio guide was very good for visually impaired visitors.
3658,Visited this venue for the first time as part of the Science Festival - loved it! Access is great - wide doors - massive lift - easy to navigate & good signage. 
3659,"For such a small shop in an old building, the disabled access is surprisingly good! The wide door was propped open already when I arrived, there was no step to get in, and once inside there was enough room to move around and turn. The shop is very small, so be aware for this if you do use a larger powerchair or need a bit of extra room to turn easily. Everything in the shop is at a low height which makes it easy to view from a seated position. While this is not a sit-in cafe, there is a bench outside the shop window if you'd like to take a minute to sit and enjoy your shortbread! I also spotted some stools stacked inside which could be used if you require a break from standing. "
3660,Disabled parking near the entrance.
3661,fully accesible building
3662,"Once again, this is a 4 rather than a 5 because of the building work. There are plenty of lifts that give access to all floors. The main open plan ground floor is still spacious and easy to manoeuvre around with a wheelchair even though the box office has been moved to a temporary table which has cut the Lyttleton cafe area down somewhat. A ramp is in place  by the Lyttleton cafe allowing external access - I am not sure if this is temporary. Outer corridors to stalls of Olivier theatre are spacious."
3663,They have a huge car park and there is also buses that visit the zoo from local centres. 
3664,"Completely step-free throughout the entire tour, from entrance points to exiting. Smooth marble surfaces also allowed for rather effortless wheeling! "
3665,Very friendly and helpful staff
3666,Once across the car park then there is a ramp into the restaurant. 
3667,"Ramp into store, lift to upstairs at the back of the store. The shop can be busy and the aisles can get a bit crowded. "
3668,"The bathroom was large, the sink was at a good height, there was space for a turning circle and handles for transferring. There was a bath with shower and a bath board which is great if you want to sit and have a shower if getting in and out of the bath would be difficult. The bathroom was very clean too- always good!"
3669,"Fantastic, wanted to help, were aware but not overpowering. Made sure i was ok and everything was good for me."
3670,Good sized accessible loo on the cafe side on the ground floor. Not sure about elsewhere.
3671,"There is ample parking outside the shop, with bus services stopping southbound 25m away services 11, 15, 16, 23, 36 and 45 and also northbound, a pedestrian crossing is 35m from the northbound bus stop."
3672,The  Glyptoteket is in the city centre. There are many buses that stop directly outside. The buses and metro in Copenhagen is accessible. The gallery is next door to Tivoli.
3673,"Being picky about my food I love going to subway.  I get to make a completely unique sandwich without paying for loads of extras and it's pretty tasty.  The branch on the A9 between Stirling and Perth is new and a very convenient stop for lunch after my ski lessons in Glasgow. They've  done their best access wise, though the disabled entrance is a long walk from the car park and through a bit of an awkward gate. The general access doors are a little awkward as one pushes and the other pulls and they're quite stiff.  Once inside everything is easy enough to get round and the staff are uber friendly and helpful.  I had a wee chat with the owner and made a few suggestions. He actually listed and did what he could straight away, a new ramp has appeared from the carpark to the pavement and the mole hills on the path are gone.  He's going to look at making a ramp to the main door soon."
3674,The restaurant is part of the Union Square shopping centre so we parked at the shopping centers car park.
3675,nice and friendly and easy to talk
3676,I used Thames link then the shuttle. It could not be easier.  As a ramp is required at St Pancras only I do book assistance.
3677,Very helpful and friendly.
3678,All of the staff we meet were very helpful and friendly and will help you to find out about any of the attractions in the local area if you want information on them
3679,Unfortunately the member of staff on the door was particularly grumpy and unhelpful and said that I couldn’t go into the shop without a face mask on. 
3680,"Can't comment on the parking. Don't try to get there by Metro - the nearby stations are not wheelchair accessible. Paris buses all have ramp access. We used a 69 bus to get to the Champ de Mars, from where it is a short wheel or walk to the western end of the promenade. The 63 bus route runs parallel to the walk. Be careful to check on-line whether the bus stop you intend to use is wheelchair accessible. A few are not, including the 69 stop at the Musée d'Orsay. "
3681,"Our approach was along a nice driveway (photo 1) towards car park area, which is large with 9 disabled bays close to the main entrance (photo 2), which itself is through an archway (photo 3) wide enough for wheelchair or scooter to easily get through and all on the level. A truly delightful courtyard welcomes you to sit in among the flower beds, and there is a ramp (photo 4 ) is help you move around. The first little shop we visited was a gift shop, (photo 5) full of interesting knickknacks  that we could browse through, (photo 6)  and this is all on the level. (photo 7). We then went through another archway (photo 8) with quite a few little stalls to see,   all on level polished brickwork paving for easy access (photo 9). There was a sweet shop with large glass jars, (photo 10) then we entered a little shop selling cards, framed  pictures and other gifts (photo 11). Back in the beautiful courtyard, (photo 12) a picture postcard Tea room (photo 13) draws you towards it. Beside the lovely flower display the entrance awaits (photo 14). There is a small low step to get you into the Tea room, which is manageable, although we chose to leave our wheelchair outside. The entrance is all on the level and is very appealing (photo 15). There are a number of rooms for you to choice where to sit to enjoy your refreshment and the restaurant is very nicely laid with dark relaxing cane furniture (photo 16), and there is a terraced area outside, also tastefully inviting. We sat inside to enjoy our toasted tea cake and coffee, along with quite a few others also enjoying their selection.   As you exit, there is a toilet by the entrance door, (photo 17) very basic with bare necessities, (photo 18) although this is not the actual disabled toilet. Linking the courtyard lies a compressed gravel pathway (photo 19) passing a couple of lovely small shops, which is very easy to move along with your wheelchair, leading to the disabled toilet (photo 20).  Our final thoughts  If you enjoy these converted shopping villages, then this one is for you and is a must when visiting Northampton area and the other places around here we have reviewed for you. You will spend quite a bit of time happily browsing through all the different shops and the must see Tea room.  We feel you will cope with this visit, especially if like myself you are able to get up off your wheelchair or scooter, and take a few steps on your own. However, your carer will be able to help you enjoy your visit here."
3682,"This is perfect for anybody - whisky enthusiast or otherwise. It takes you through the history of whisky, how it is made and how each area makes whisky different in character and flavour.  It's an accessible journey, right from the moment you enter the Scotch Whisky Experience. We were greeted by two friendly members of reception who confirmed our silver tour and we waited for the tour to commence. I would say the 'waiting area' could be bigger but we were only there for five minutes.   It was the attentive nature of staff that made the visit for me. I attended with a powerchair user and the 'experience' starts with an immersive trip on a barrel that guides you through the history of whisky and what happens during the distilling process. Doesn't sound accessible, but the way the venue have adapted is inclusive. The staff member spoke us through every step of how it would work which makes you feel so welcome. You just knew exactly what to expect and that made it such an enjoyable visit.  Even as somebody who has never been here before - embarrassing as a lifetime Edinburgh resident! - I was extremely impressed by the concise yet effective tour. The whole tour was short but it didn't feel rushed. While the tasting is great - and the journey at this point is even better - the colours to coordinate which whisky you want to taste could be a bit clearer. They didn't really match up with the colours told by the guide, so I ended up with Speyside (not complaining, it's my favourite) instead of Campbeltown.  Oh, and you will LOVE the whisky collection they have!"
3683,Book ahead to make sure you get a table that is suitable and to let the patron know you have a wheelchair as there is a step but they have a ramp to overcome this.  The toilets are not suitable so make sure you go beforehand.  The food is typically French and to a high standard.
3684,"Bamburgh Castle loomed before us and I did wonder how on earth I was going to get in.  Once in the main carpark we were filtered off and made our way up a very narrow track.  There was no room for passing and it is a good job they use radios to manage comings and goings.  This must of been how they got up to the castle years ago, it is amazing a car fits through the gatehouse.  Once at the top parking could not of been close and even without need of a wheelchair I didn't envy the walk up from the main carpark.  It was an easy wheel to the main door, here was a sloping step/ramp which was tricky to negotiate (needed moe muscle). The first part of the castle was no problem and visitors were asked to move around in a clockwise way, to see everything. I was unable to venture further and shown a DVD of what I was missing. It appears that I miss a lot. Incidentally on looking out of Windows brings home how high it actually is and how close the sea is.  Once the Castle was done we headed for the little coffee shop, well shed really.  It was the old stables.  Apparently this wasn't the main cafe as that was up some steps.  There was a disabled toilet / baby change and unfortunately I was after one.  There were grab rails and my wheelchair fitted insider.  But it did not feel hygienic! Probably just me being picky(it also felt like going into a shed)."
3685,"I enjoyed visiting Vapiano, and while the interior looks stunning, there are a lot of ups and downs (literally, lots of steps) which is significant when you have to serve yourself. I covered all three floors during my visit, and that's because the entrance is at the top, the bar is one level down in the middle, and the toilets are on the ground floor. If you use a wheelchair, there is one lift available between the floors, but for a self-serve restaurant there's a surprising number of staff, so I'm confident assistance would be offered to reduce the number of trips you'd have to make here there and everywhere. It is a different concept for dining out."
3686,The signage was clear and at good heights. They had induction loop and also had headphones for people to listen to the broadcast from the Big Blue Tent too. Everything is on green outside carpetting so it's pretty even and wasn't hard work to propel over. 
3687,Vast space with stacks of room for carers to assist - facilities spotless! 
3688,"I came in via the entrance on the corner of Balgreen Road and Gorgie Road. The main car gates are closed but there are two footpaths on either side that bring you into the park. Some paths are a bit gravelly but I did not feel any gradients were difficult to manoeuvre. The paths were also wide which was helpful with social distancing,"
3689,Small mainly gravel car park....no specific disabled parking. No nearby bus stops that I am aware of.
3690,Good transport links. Just down the hill from Buchannan Bus Station. I'm unsure about parking as I used public transport. 
3691,"As this was a connecting flight cannot comment on the transport, staff supportby the Airport staff was excellent. There were fully serviced and accessible areas throughout, wide spacious aisles."
3692,"Will have to be dragged over a chipping car park to reach ramp on far side of building (photo 2). There are a number of small steps here and there, although we managed with our wheelchair with aid of carer. No lift, as a single storey building. Seating is available in delightful cafe, but it has steps to get you down, you would have to get up off your wheelchair. Would not recommend scooters or power chair to use facilities."
3693,"Staff in the hotel on the whole were excellent although I did feel those on reception were not that interested in what my wife was asking (I couldn’t as the desk was much higher than my wheelchair) nor on the occasions I had to phone them.  On to the The Sea Star Restaurant and we have to say that we were impressed with both the food and the staff.   We were slightly apprehensive having read other reviews but we found this to be unfounded. During the two weeks were stayed here, we found the hotel to be well occupied and this was certainly the case at mealtimes.  Most morning and evenings it was really busy. That said, the staff were always very helpful in finding us a table to either accommodate the wheelchair or ‘park’  it when I transferred.   As this was a self service restaurant,  my wife had to do the carrying, although staff did assist on the odd occasion.  Unlike some reviews, we found the choice and quality of food during the two weeks to be good.  Yes, the menu did repeat on the second week but that was to be expected.  With choices of starter, main and desert, even myself (a fussy eater) and my vegetarian wife found something we liked and, more importantly, enjoyed. It was in the restaurant that we found the staff excelled and would like to thank them all for making it a pleasure to eat there. Special thanks has to go to Valentina, Edwin, Felipe and John.  No matter how busy they were, they were always friendly and very helpful at the same time  very efficient and kept things running smoothly.  Thank you - you were all so nice to us."
3694,"The toilets are upstairs which I didn't know before booking. There are fairly steep stairs, about one flight, but there are chairs near the top by the toilets if you can manage with difficulty but need a rest. I managed with help. The toilet I used was very small and didn't have rails but did have furniture to lean on. You wold struggle to get a carer in this one with you, but the second one was bigger.   The waiter did give me the option of using their sister restaurant Robatary's disabled toilet, which is about 5 doors down. Not ideal but an option if you wish to eat here."
3695,"Upsides: Most shops very accessible and helpful staff, good amount of well maintained disabled toilets including a 'changing places' facility. Fantastic local shopmobility scheme based here.  Downsides: The main lifts are often overly busy, especially at weekends and you may find yourself waiting some time before you can get in one despite one being marked as wheelchair priority."
3696,"Assist staff are excellent. They have set area's for wheelchairs, stand alone  chairs if you need more room for whatever reason. Access to a disabled toilet. The member of staff helping me checked on me regularly to make sure I was comfortable, was there anything she could get me etc. I was treated very well and it made the whole evening a very enjoyable experience. There is a number to phone to arrange and more information on their website about what is available."
3697,Access in and around the building:  The hotel has all the characteristics that you would expect to find. Getting around was problematic due to the low light levels and lack of visible signage.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible bedroom was good as it was well lit.   Access in the dining area:  The dining area was large and well laid out.  Access to other facilities:  The lounge I visited was not too light and the background music became irritating after a while.
3698,"Lots of wide wheelchair friendly paths, even the lower woodland walk was manageable in the manual wheelchair with very little help!"
3699,The property has a Clos-o-mat washer/dryer toilet and drop down grab rails either side for support. This is what we liked about the property as we have a toilet like this at home. It gives independence - home from home for us! The large wet room offers space to move your wheelchair around freely. Lots of space for a carer if needed.
3700,We parked nearby on street parking but as we left we saw a very easy car park adjacent to the Ice Centre which wasn’t easily sign posted as we had driven past it twice. It’s a once way system around the Motorpoint arena which is what’s it’s called in addition to the NIC.
3701,We got a taxi straight to the venue which really helped as it's up some really large hills. According to google maps it's a 10 minute walk from the Royal Mile which does look accurate if you don't have mobility impairments. 
3702,Has a wheelchair ramp at the front entrance but that is about it. The staff were so unhelpful and looked upset about working there. Terrible quality of food.
3703,The only staff that I met were the staff at the special assistance department and I can not speak highly enough of them. They stayed with me until I got my taxi. So helpful.
3704,"The entrance was easy, the carpets are smooth. My scooter might have struggled with accessing the verandah but a wheelchair would cope fine. Doorways are wide. "
3705,"For us this wasn't an issue. Our problems are with rough ground, visual impairment and lack of safety awareness by the twins. This venue was great. "
3706,"The Ladybird Barge is a wheelchair accessible boat, operated by volunteers from the Ladybird Boat Trust and offering trips along the River Great Ouse between April and October each year. Our group takes the trip every year and it is something that we all very much look forward to. We have a picnic lunch on board or we can go ashore.The weather doesn't spoil the trip, as if we're not out on deck we can watch through the large windows."
3707,"The first issue we had was finding a parking space beside the ground. However, we finally found a disabled parking space near the spotty bag shop in Banff. We then had to cross the road and follow this bumpy path until we got to the ground, and I was expecting to be told if I could go around the side of the ground to access (Deveronvale if you're reading this PLEASE let wheelchairs/scooters around the side of the ground) because I had to go through a ""Wheelchair entrance"" which wasn't good. I had to drive through a very tight angle (call me Michael Schumacher) then there was an about 4-inch drop so I needed a strewed to lift me down. When we finally entered the ground and a member of staff greeted us and welcomed us to Princess Royal Park and told us that we could go in a disabled shelter, it had a ramp up to the door of the shelter but there were already 4 people in the shelter so I, unfortunately, couldn't get into the disabled shelter so I can't really comment. We then went around the back of the 'stand' and found a quiet spot with a good view to watch the football match, another thing I would like to comment on is the fact that Princess Royal Park has smooth cement paths all the way around the stadium, perfect for wheelchairs! At halftime, I asked the Steward to show me when the toilet is so I was surprised to find out there was a disabled toilet. When I went into the disabled loo, I was annoyed as there was no red cord but besides that, the toilet was pretty good. At the end of the match, we left by the gate behind the stand."
3708,There is a blue badge bay about five yards from the door and space to park directly outside the salon on double yellow lines.   The nearest car park is about ten minutes walk/push away so on street parking is the best bet.  There's a bus stop almost opposite in the High Street.
3709,Staff was helpful and great. They explained to do about history and story for Kew Garden and staff show us what  they are about flowers.
3710,"There is an accessible loo situated to the right hand side of the bar area on entering the building away from the main toilets and is always open so no need to have to ask for a key! It is a good size, clean and checked on a regular basis. No shortage of hand rails that's for sure, it is big enough for a chair and a carer if required. There is a pull cord within reach should you need assistance. The tap is also really easy to use if you have weakness in your upper body."
3711,"The staff were excellent, friendly and ensured everyone had a good safe time. They were very sensitive to ensuring social distancing was adhered to. Santa was still on particularly  good form - counting down the days until next Christmas! "
3712,There are no accessible toilets on site but there are accessible toilets on the lower levels of the adjacent car park. It can be a bit of a climb down and back up the ramps.
3713,"The Wellcome Collection is centrally located on Euston Road. It's almost opposite Euston Station and also nearby is Euston Square, Warren Street and King's Cross stations. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. I travelled on public transport to get there and it was only a 2 minute walk from getting off the bus."
3714,There are two disabled bays. I have always been able to park in one of those bays when staying. There is plenty of room either side of the car.
3715,"Access to the main enterance is good for disabled people however we felt that the access needs to be improved by providing handrails as well as better signage.   M&D's do not seem to cater well for people with visual impairment as none of the signage is in Braille or offer any sort of audio assistance, the steps are not clearly marked.    "
3716,Accessible loo available for to take a pic.
3717,There isn't one so it inevitably cuts your time there short! 
3718,There is an accessible toilet in the grounds. It meets basic requirements for space and does have decent contrast for people with vision impairments. There are all required toilet rails but it does double as baby change. 
3719,Staff were very attentive and offered assistance without being asked on the occasions I visited.
3720,"It's hard to speak too highly of the hotel staff, all of whom were very attentive and alert to the specific needs of people with disabilities. On booking, it's possible to opt for a personal assistance care package. A variety of these are available, offering different levels of care according to guests' needs."
3721,Spacious accessible toilets using the Radar key.
3722,"Dundee Carers Centre aims to improve the lives of carers and those living with disabilities  through practical and emotional support, counselling, advocacy, training and information about services, rights and benefits. The staff are all so lovely and the support they provide can make such a big difference. They can offer self-care activity vouchers for carers and provides free counselling with trained professionals.   I believe there are staff who are familiar with sign language, theres a loop system for those with hearing problems. Entry is through an electric door, theres a slight ramp from the pavement to the door. Inside is very spacious, there are two accessible toilets and everything is easily accessible. The reception desk is quite high but wasn’t a problem. "
3723,The staff was really nice.
3724,"Lots of stairs, ground floor is split level and rails are tightly packed together, 1st floor is up a large flight of stairs, no lift access. Parking is excellent, own car park at the rear (no disabled spaces though) in street parking to the front. The store is not the one it’s the picture, that’s in Fraserburgh "
3725,"Finding a parking space can be stressful, however the National Media Museum provides parking spaces at front of the museum, with the maximum stay up to 4 hours, giving you plenty of time to explore the museum. Also provides  car and coach drop-off directly outside the entrance.  "
3726,"This review is for the Starbucks in St Pancras international. It is one in a large chain of coffee shops. This branch was recently renovated and Starbucks have agreed to change the design following disabled people complaining.  Ann Webster tweeted me to say ""Tina - we have already challenged this before on Twitter recently - I went to St Pancras to check it after @Christiane raised it on here.  The BBC got involved and Starbucks have agreed to change the design -the Regional Manager contacted me and I posted on here to tell everyone"".  Thank you Ann and everyone who raised this. My review shows how the branch looked today (24/02/2020)."
3727,"We found it easy to get around with my son's powered wheelchair. There is an area near the otter pond which has gravel and a difficult bridge, but the team at the zoo are planning to change these very soon to improve accessibility."
3728,Very little parking opportunity as the Gallery is in the heart of the city.
3729,Good. Attended toilets at the stations. Plenty of clean disabled loos at Gatwick.
3730,"Massive carpark which, although doesn't have a marked disabled space, is never full, even on the very busy May day and so there is plenty of room for parking leaving space for access.  The carpark is a little rough in places, but not enough to cause any problems."
3731,"Wheelchair friendly, plenty of accessible toilets, helpful staff, not as busy earlier in day, lots to see."
3732,"Great little sport for brunch, lunch or cocktails. Very accessible and welcoming. Staff exceptional."
3733,All staff helpful and friendly in this busy local pub
3734,"From what I've seen I can't fault it. The Cock Inn is worth travelling to,"
3735,There was a disabled toilet signposted but I did not use it
3736,"There is a disabled toilet and a cafe in Register House, which is wheelchair accessible."
3737,"A Fantastic Waterpark!!  Siam Park in Tenerife is a brilliant day out.   Spread out over a large site, landscaped with plants, you need to use the maps to find everything!  It has a huge beach/wave pool, children's pools, a lazy river and a variety of flumes.  Very popular place, so it surprised me that it didn't have better disabled access /facilities. I think these could be improved, so even more people can enjoy it."
3738,Fantastic interactive area for children and teenagers.  Plus in height of summer a nearby beach which is cleaned daily. Nearly opened toilets. Parking in nearby car parks. 
3739,Always hard to generalize but I'd say you'll find people helpful and friendly.
3740,"Fantastic views, wildlife and visitors centre at Sumburgh head."
3741,"It looks like there is step free access from the street, but in fact there is a small drop inside the restaurant, so there is a half inch lip to get over to get out. Fairly tight inside for maneuvering."
3742,"All staff very helpful and considerate to my needs, willing to help with opening doors and ensuring that I was able to participate equally on the factory tour. Tour guide was excellent, made us feel very welcome."
3743,"Recommended by a neighbour to try an outing to RBGE. Mobility scooters or wheelchairs are available to use at no cost or you can make a donation if you like. Hire time is 2 hours which in a freezing January day was more than enough. We phoned ahead to book and were warmly received when we arrived. Had a great hour exploring the gardens. Some hills and bumpy paths but the scooter took it all in its stride. Staff great at showing how to work the scooter, helping get set up and helping me feel comfortable waiting whilst my husband brought the car round. Short walk from the John Hope gate to the car pick up point. Web site could have made their accessibility statement more visible - especially as it's very good."
3744,Level access from the pavement into the bar through two sets of double doors. The doors were easily wide enough for my powerchair to pass through one door. There's a smooth and level run to the tables and these can be moved to make room if required.
3745,"Many bus routes serve Richmond, and the station is less than half a mile away, District Line and National Rail, with staff always on hand to give assistance with ramps etc."
3746,No problem with the facilities grab rails etc. We were offered other stuff but they were not required. It was a wet room which was what we required (and reason we chose this property).  
3747,"Flanders Moss is easily accessible, a short walk from the car park brings you to the 1km boardwalk around the Moss. There are information boards and displays about the history of this fascinating site.    Explore this exciting habitat at any time of year, you'll find frogs and toads in spring, lizards and adders in summer, geese in autumn and winter. And you can get onto the moss with the all abilities circular path and boardwalk, which takes you out onto the bog in safety and without damaging this fragile habitat.  The viewing tower (7m) provides a panoramic view across the moss and surrounding landscape."
3748,Very helpful staff both during loading and in restaurant etc.
3749,There are apparently 2 disabled spaces in the  School car park but these were taken. Staff did not know how to get access to this car park anyway. There are yellow light nes on Lauriston Place and normally you can park there with a disabled badge. However no parking bollards are all along length of street on both side des. There are some spaces at the bottom and also my If new road opposite ( new meadow place?) but it is a difficult walk back up a steep incline . There is a bus stop reasonably nearby coming from south of city. No sign of a bus stop coming from lothian road end
3750,"Liverpool Central Station 5 mins walk away, Taxis/Buses 2-3 mins away"
3751,"Small, local history museum with galleries on 3 floors. There are displays on a variety of topics including the big storm of 2014 which damaged the railway line. There is also a small garden."
3752,Good parking close to the door. Just a few minutes from the tram and train stations at Edinburgh Park.
3753,"When we arrived it was clearly signposted. We loved the display boards explains what you could see and do. An automatic door opened and we walked in and were immediately welcomed. Collecting our tickets we went on the Silver Tour. As we said. Took the barrel ride and then went in to the spirit of Scotland area. Benches for people to sit on and wheelchair spaces too as the guide told the whisky story whilst an amazing panoramic wall showed films from across the five whisky area. We loved the scratch cards where you could get a smell of the characteristics of the different whisky regions.  Next was a blenders room where everyone sat in front of benches and the Guide told more of the story ... and then the picture on the wall came alive as a character spoke more about whisky and blending. Whilst this was happening the displays of whisky bottles in the cabinet in front of us came alive with smoke swirling from the bottles, flames bubbling in the bottles and sparkles and more.  At the end of this the wall changed from being wooden panels to become a vault door. With the clunking of the locks the door opened and we were invited into to see the world’s largest whisky collection.  Everywhere on the tour was wheelchair accessible but also well thought out we we could share in the experience just like everyone else. "
3754,Completely all accessible
3755,"A perfect, worry free holiday. We have visited several times, and I don't think you could find better accommodation for wheelchair users. All apartments are easily accessible, light and airy, and have everything you need for a home away from home. Equipment such as profiling bed, hoists, shower chairs etc are available, so you don't have to take loads of equipment with you. Stunning location, and plenty to see and do when out and about."
3756,"Easy to get in and out, but only a couple of tables suitable for wheelchair users"
3757,Bala Lake Railway provides part of a lovely day out in Bala. A round trip of around 1 hour with lake views and welsh scenery. A steam train assisted by volunteers who help maintain and run the railway. 
3758,"The building provides such fantastic accessibility at the entrances, cafe, disabled toilet, education space and activities and events held on the ground floor including a weekly free ""art trolley"" for children.  However access to exhibitions is difficult. Each gallery has two sets of double doors to overcome which are not automatic or equipped with a disabled push buttons to open them. The staff are very willing to open the doors for disabled visitors and have a radio system which can swiftly contact a free member of staff to assist with difficulties anywhere in the building."
3759,"I was not made aware there was disabled access, however I also did not make myself known to staff. I was sat quite near the front, and so could see everything.  I am not a wheelchair user, however there were wheelchairs at the front of the crowd, so I believe they must have disabled access."
3760,"The venue itself has a spacious & private car parking lot, with one dedicated disabled parking space. On a busy evening, only the one disabled parking space could be seen as a problem, however, the other spaces are close by and suitable sizing for disabled access. There is a slight incline which may cause slight difficulty when getting in and out of a car but nothing too problematic. This venue has only lost one star due to public transport difficulties as it's located out of the main town and close by to housing. A disabled taxi would be more useful, to bring you to the door of the venue. "
3761,"Parking in Salisbury is rather confusing and that doesn't help the visitor. The bays need remarking and there are no signs pointing you to the disabled bays. This restaurant does have disabled bays outside it (on street parking), not to be confused with the loading bays though."
3762,Everything was on one level. 
3763,"I was pointed in the direction of the toilets which turned out to be one toilet for all visitors. Wheelchair access to the toilet is not ideal - there is a platform lift to enable access to the corridor that leads to the toilet. Inside is narrow and cluttered, and there was no soap (not even a dispenser?) when I visited. "
3764,"The priory staff were really friendly and helpful. They asked me if I was wheelchair dependent before offering to take me round to the accessible entrance, which I found a bit rude. I don't think she meant it to be offensive though - maybe just needs training. Otherwise, everyone was really pleasant. I won't mark them down for fussing an assistance dog, as she is seriously cute!"
3765,Very good access toilets.
3766,"The Imperial War Museum London is near to Lambeth North, Elephant and Castle and Waterloo Tube Stations, none of which are step free. The nearest train station is Waterloo which does have step free access. There are a few buses that stop close by to the museum. We travelled on the bus number 59 from Euston Station. We exited at Kennington Road/  Imperial War Museum stop. From there we entered Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, see photo, in whose grounds the museum is located. "
3767,"Calthorpe Community Garden is a 1.5 acres of green space which was saved from office redevelopment in King's Cross. It opened in the early 1980s. The beautiful gardens contain trees, shrubs and flowers as well as a community food growing area, all with a focus on environmental concerns. The gardens are divided into several spaces. There are small lawns, sports pitches and a children's play area. The main building has toilets including an accessible toilet. This area would also normally offer a community centre space and a café. There are also greenhouses and workshops. Staff are very friendly and helpful. I would be very happy to visit again.  Overall disabled access is very good but there are a few steps so in places you might have to retrace your steps."
3768,"This first part of the day trip is a pleasant easy start with scenic countryside views leading to the historical pretty village of Chaddesley Corbett, so even if you feel you could not manage the woodland walk, or make use of the Swan Inn, it’s still a nice start for you, bearing in mind the next point of interest on your trip will not open until 10.00am.  We started our visit in the village of Belbroughton, Bromsgrove, so set your SAT NAV  DY9  9TG for the Talbot Inn.  From here and at the junction, follow High street and sign for Blakedown / Chaddesley Corbett. There is no sat NAV for the ancient woodland of Chaddesley woods nature reserve, so follow our directions for the short drive. A few yards after leaving the Talbot and High st, TURN LEFT on Church road. Then stay on this lane for a few miles, until you reach a “Y” junction and TURN RIGHT for Woodcote / Kidderminster and then drive through woodland, it’s a nice countryside trip for you. At the next junction, TURN SHARP RIGHT for Bluntington / Woodrow, along Woodcote Lane, and drive through woodland again. Look for the roadside pull in area,  parking the car alongside the narrow woodland lane (photo 1)  The gate will allow you to enter the wide path (photo 2) for a pleasant woodland walk.  Chaddesley woods is mentioned in the Doomsday book, shown as “the woods of two leagues” perhaps wooded since the ice age, ancient flowers offer the clue, such as yellow Archangel, herb Paris, Dogs Mercury, as well as small leaved Lime. It became a nature reserve in 1973 due to the kind support of John Cadbury. (photo 3). On the east side there are ancient woodland of mainly Oak, with Hazel Coppice. It also supports Rowan trees, Midland Hawthorn which has two seeds in its berry  instead of one.  To the west, it is different, with large planted broad leaved species, and large areas of conifers. Where you have parked is the “Jubillee walk” created in 1977 to mark the Queens 25th jubilee anniversary, and you can easily follow this path on Yellow markers, and it attracts many visitors each year.  Now set SAT NAV for DY10 4SA. The Swan inn. Follow Sat NAV, and you will arrive at the gated entry for Chaddesley Corbett (photo 4) CHADDESLEY CORBETT The village is an ancient settlement, with a pre-historical mound, and there are parts of a Roman road, while it’s name is thought to mean “Ceadda’s clearing in the woods”. It is first mentioned in the Saxon charter when the land was given to the Bishop of Worcester, and also mentioned in the Doomsday book 1086, as belonging to a Saxon noblewoman. The village was known later on as Chaddesley, but following the Norman conquest, the old Manor was owned by the Corbett family, and the area became known as Chaddesley Corbett. It is a large parish of some 6079 acres, where the Dovedale brook rises in Belbroughton, and flows south of the parish. Barnet brook, which also rises in Belbroughton, waters the northern area.  Chaddesley Corbett has one main road running through the village, (photo 5) where you will find black and white timbered cottages, and red bricked houses, (photo 6) of different years. A number of delightful cottages may be seen along the main road (photos 7, 8 and 9) leading you towards two attractive Inns, The Swan Inn, and the Talbot Inn, of which we now offer you a review. THE SWAN INN The Doomsday book recorded the village of Chaddesley Corbett, and following dates show that during the reign of King Edward V1 in 1552, a licence would now be required from 1634 to run any Inn as stated “there are nun that sell ale without a licence.  The Swan became rented by the miller master, John Bate, then his son Thomas took over in 1841. It was a home brew house, the drink being mild, pale, sweetish and strong, popular in this area, but they were also licensed to sell wines and spirits. Thomas had died by 1850, and his wife Elizabeth took over as landlady, but she retired in 1873, and a William Horne became the tenant with the help of his wife Mary. In 1927 the Swan was leased to Daniel Batham and son, and remains so, with the intention of keeping it as a centre of local community use.  The Swan inn, (photo 10) has a reasonable car park, but very plain looking, (photo 11) until you step inside, to the bar area. (12) while the main lounge of timbered beams, old wooden tables and a warm welcoming stove awaits you (13).The larger bar area (14) also  has a warm stove to greet you (15), and toilets are situated by the bar reception (16).   If you now drive along the main road a few yards, you arrive at The Talbot Inn, (17) which has been closed for some time while undergoing renovations over the last number of years, and permission has been granted for it to reopen again as an Inn, perhaps late 2022, although not much seems to be happening at the moment.  If you drive a little further on, to the churchyard, (photo 18)  we can give A bit of World War One history for you. The home guard division of Chaddesley received orders to form a line of defence against enemy attack by tanks, so the men here used two large 4 foot diameter drainage pipes, filled them with concrete, placed an iron bar with a loop in it into the setting concrete, then attached a large steel chain between the two pipes that lay each side of the road, and you can still see these pipes that lie in the church orchard  ( photo 19) right by the gate leading into the churchyard (photo 20). www.Chaddesley-Corbett.co.uk/history  Thus ends part one of this day trip, and we suggest now you read part two HARVINGTON HALL AND MUSEUM. The Hall opens at 10.00am, and there is a cafe available before your two hour visit, which is wheelchair friendly. "
3769,"The accessible toilet is very spacious, with good lighting and hand rails in appropriate places. There are lowered mirrors enabling wheelchair users to see themselves which is often overlooked!  The accessible toilet is also home to the pub's only baby changing facilities - as such, it may sometimes be quite busy.  However, the staff are good at ensuring the toilet is kept clean and well stocked."
3770,Wide fronted doorway. Wheelchair accessible toilet. Disabled parking. Function room with direct access from car park.  Fantastic food and helpful staff.
3771,There was plenty of parking spaces. 
3772,Extremely easy to access due to the large ramp leading to the car park where where there are two sets of automatic doors. There are multiple bus stops nearby.  The store is a 15-20 minute walk to the main bus station. 
3773,Staff were perfectly friendly but also gave you space to browse. They seemed happy to offer assistance when needed.
3774,"Not visited yet but wanted to let you know how easy it is to book tickets, BB parking and wheelchair loan.  Just one phone call and a very helpful person at the other end.  Can't wait to visit the Becket exhibition knowing that I can park and get around the museum. I live outside London and didn't want to risk driving up to London after having purchased tickets to find that I cannot get parking close by or get around.  The V&A should take note!!"
3775,This train station is located to the rear of the shops in Easton Place it is well back from the road there is a car  park in front of the gate in to the station however this is used by people going to the shops as well as the train services. It is a basic station with 2 platforms there  is good signage to indicate which platform you need for each service  Platform 1 is the one for the service in to Glasgow and is the main one for the station
3776,"The Medicne Garden is a tranquil restored Victoran Walled Garden with 2 cafes, a couple of eclectic shops and a pamper room (not accessible). In the summer it is a real sun trap and has an accessible decked cafe with a glass screen to protect you from the wind. There is also a greenhouse cafe in the rear which has a ramp (on request). 3 BlueBadge parking spaces and an accessible toilet. The car park ground is rough as are the paythways and gravel by the rear glasshouse  cafe. It is, however somewhere different to go on a dry  day and make a change from accessible garden centres and pubs to meet friends."
3777,There is flat access and automatic entrance doors.  A good sized lift to each floor The accessible room has a fitted kitchen and dining area  There is plenty of space to manoeuvre around in a wheelchair and would accomodate a good sized powerchair with ease Transferring from wheelchair to the bed is easy due to the large amount of space at the side of the bed. There is space under the bed to accomodate a portable hoist An emergency pull cord is beside the bed 
3778, There is a bus stop outside the station but the route from that stop to the station entrance involves another incline. There is a good drop off point near the station taxi point which has level access and there are also 3 or 4 parking places for Wheelchair users but those spaces are constantly abused by able bodied people and parking time is limited anyway!  So I always use a taxi which drops me to catch my train and also collects me on return.
3779,I love this restaurant but you can only go if you request a table near the door and agree not to use the toilets .  But the food is worth it for me!
3780,"Access to shop is good but when in, the furniture is packed in so prevents easily manoeuvring round store."
3781,The Most Incredible Burritos but NOT a wheelchair friendly venue. 
3782,Very helpful and for me it made such a difference having table service and not having to juggle with a tray. 
3783,"Nearest car park is about a quarter of a mile away at least, although it does have plenty of disabled parking bays. It's not a street for road vehicles, so the nearest bus stop is maybe 100 m away."
3784,"Dobbies is not just a garden centre, it also has a gift shop and restaurant as well as a food hall selling local produce. Breakfasts seem to be a hit or somewhere to pop in for a coffee after a browse. There is much to see in this shop with a vast range of stock and it is an enjoyable experience with its spacious store. Something for everyone, worth a visit!"
3785,"The parking is not directly connected to the theatre in that it is council parking and blue badge holders still have to pay. I always find this annoying. However, it is flat, reasonably well lit and easy to get to the theatre door from the car park. There are also enough spaces."
3786,"The access is good, the Staff happy to help all they can. Does get very busy, best to get in early to get to the front."
3787,"The are two different disabled toilets within the festival market, one could be opened with a radar key and the other opened with a key that you needed to get from the market office within office hours.  The toilets were clean and spacious and included a working hoist and a changing bed. The toilets had alarm system and guides for people to use the hoists. "
3788,The store has a wide entrance and you then go to your left through automatic doors to enter the store then a quick right turn. The display units run across the store and a typical of MS or any food retailer. There is good signage in the store and the aisles were clear to move up and down.  As you would expect some items were on higher selves.
3789,No obstacles 
3790,"Once inside, reception is immediately in front of you. A wooden style floor makes it easy to wheel around. Off to the left of the reception is the bar seating area and beyond that the dining area.  The tables and chairs in the dining area are all moveable which made for easier wheelchair access.  There are two lifts that take you to the upper floors of the building.   The accessible room we had was spacious and had a very good wet room with all the features you’d expect to find. The beds were comfortable, the lighting good, and the room spotlessly clean. "
3791,The accessible toilet is in a good position and a decent size.
3792,They are lovely and accommodating. 
3793,The main entrance doors open by pushing the button which we can sometimes find quite awkward but once inside its all on one floor. There are lots of different rooms to use if booked in advance and different types of seating around.
3794,Worth checking The Refúgio dos Burros in Estômbar when open 
3795,"The staff appear friendly if somewhat ignorant about accommodating wheelchairs, probably because there are multiple accessible pubs in the city centre, with more car parks, trains, and buses nearby, limiting the number of wheelchair users among their clientele. "
3796,"I didn't have high expectations of the loos in such a busy place, but I was pleasantly surprised. As I approached, there was a queue for the ladies' toilets right out the door, but a steward sprang forward, ushered me and my scooter past the line of waiting people and unlocked the door to my very own large, clean accessible loo. Just one downside: the light inside was on an energy-saving motion sensor and kept deciding to turn itself off because my movement wasn't lively enough to let it know I was still there. "
3797,"There are only 2 disabled spots so more would be better but it is a big car park so not generally a problem to park, although we walk as its local.the car park is right next to the pub and all on one level to get in. The pub is on a main road at he front but the access is from the back a bus stops at the front."
3798,"In my humble opinion, The Black Sheep is one of the most perfect pubs in Dublin. Although it closes circa 1am, up until that point you can enjoy a gigantic range of craft beers, tasty food and a fine selection of board games. Its sister pub, Against The Grain on Wexford St., is also heavy in its deliverance of delicious booze and food. Take note of these two venues if ever you've got the hankering for a solid platter and a ice cold pint of heaven."
3799,"Quiet, but got on with service, nobody in pub, so saw no other staff."
3800,Spaces located by the door and clearly signed for blue badge holders.
3801,This station is nice and spacious with elevators down to the platform and clear signage. There are Braille and tactile maps to show plans of the station. Surfaces are smooth to move across. One of the more accessible Metro stations I've encountered in Rome.
3802,Accessible loo in shower room Ceiling track hoist. Plenty of well placed textured grab rails plus pull down rail Emergency cord. Clinical waste bin Easy open/lock door handle Textured grab rail on back of the door Plenty of hooks on back of the door
3803,"Young, enthusiastic, tried to be helpful, but had no concept of what I was talking about.  Another member of staff was called and he was obviously the handyman/technician.  He was most concerned about my having found myself unable to get out of the toilet.  Said they had an access assessment 2 months before and everything had passed!  He said they would look into it.  By the end of my visit, I was told that managements would get another agency to come along to do an access assessment."
3804,volunteers are generally happy to let the general public into the garden on the last Saturday of each month.
3805,Everywhere we went people were helpful and friendly
3806,Accessible bathroom with roll-in shower and emergency pull cords. Handheld Shower with Hose Built-in Shower Transfer Seats Handrails Roll-in Showers Safety Bar in Shower Bathroom Doors Open Outwards (in Accessible Rooms) Accessible Bathroom Controls
3807,We went to sandcastle water park in Blackpool on Saturday night. It was brilliant. They have excellent disabled changing facilities. We parked right outside the front. The water was a lot warmer than I thought it would be.
3808,No steps on the way in. Large easily accessed lift to just outside the performance area.
3809,"Signage a bit poor (as with other parts of the building), and a standard type accessible WC."
3810,"We didn't use the toilets but I did look at them, accessible toilets are in the main hall where tickets are picked up."
3811,"Excellent food, reasonable prices , impressed facilities"
3812,Our visit to the National Theatre was ace! From the moment I called to getting in and around to the great seats to the bar afterwards - everything went smoothly with no hitches at all. I've already booked to go back!
3813,"Friendly, happily carry your drink anywhere. If you can't reach payment points for cards, they'll bring things around."
3814,"Helpful, pleasant and very busy. "
3815,Accessible parking in the centre but a distance away.
3816,"It’s important to say that don’t say this is an adapted chalet, just that it’s accessible.  The bathroom is a wet room, while a little small, it’s perfect if you are ambulant like me.  I did have issues with the toilet, as it was too low and the only handrail was really badly place.  However I expected as much and asked in advance for a toilet seat raiser and stand.  They were amazing and got one for me."
3817,"We had been allocated an adapted Virginia lodge, number 1. Sadly, this disabled lodge is the very furthest possible from the facilities,right by the entrance. Every time you want to go to the bar, pool, restaurant, it’s over 800m. It also meant we had no view (other lodges get a spectacular landscape). The parking is on a heavy incline where most others are flat, so it’s very difficult to get out of the car into a wheelchair, we kept having to drive to flat ground to use the car, which undermines checking that parking is next to the lodge.    It’s also noisy, with vehicles coming and going constantly, and they often came through so fast that I was terribly worried about my daughter playing near the lodge. Being the first ones on the road, we got the fastest traffic.   We also checked about the decking area and type of furniture, to make sure we could use it. The furniture is indeed loose (not picnic table, though there is one of those also) but if you need a turning space for a weelchair then you cannot use the proper decking area, as the only bit which fits the table is by the door. We could have the furniture OR go in and out, so ended up with our chairs all in a line along the walkway with the table in the middle. We couldn’t eat on the decking like everyone else, though this might be possible if the wheelchair user isn’t involved in the food prep and can be trapped at the far side of the table through the whole meal.   I did speak to reception at one point to say the hedge was over growing the ramp area, and could they try to get it clipped back for comfort, and they acted immediately. Within the hour, the whole hedge had been clipped and tidied, so that was excellent.   We knew it was not an accessible kitchen, which was fine for us as we usually use only the oven, and my husband does all the dishes.    And here is where the biggest problem comes in - accessibility is built into the *TWIN* bedroom, they have even taken space from the double to give more wheelchair space in the twin. The doorway to the twin is widened and the bathroom pretty good, with high loo (for me, 5’5” this was a disconcertingly high loo!), toilet rails (fold up) on both sides.Only a bath with over bath shower, which is what we asked for as I take showers at the swimming pool, and a bath chair fits the bath which is ensuite to the twin. If, however, you are the disabled half of a couple with kids, there is nowhere to move around even on foot in the double, never mind with a wheelchair. The wheelchair will not go within 8m of the bedroom as it doesn’t fit through the access corridor to the double and the double (not adapted) bathroom. You end up waking the kids every time you go to the loo in their accessible bathroom. I  don’t want to have a separate room from my husband on holiday and my daughter sure doesn’t want to be in a double with her dad, so we have to try to take turns moving about. The actual floor of the loge slopes considerably, and if you are on wheels or wobbly on your feet, you will spend a lot of time falling down, being unable to adjust to the slope.   Access exists in the main building, you just often find yourself having to take different routes, and I did laugh when they said it was totally accessible, you go round the back via the gravel path - GRAVEL for wheelchair access!   The pool does have a hoist poolside and there is a track hoist in the changing area, but no bench. They also seem to have built a wall part way up the track, I can’t really fathom it, but I managed without so it was OK. The disabled change was in use by other people around 80% of the times we wanted it though, which was annoying. Avoid the times when there are swimming lessons, as you get a family in there using the larger space to change several children, in no hurry because the lesson hasn’t started yet. Meanwhile I’m cold and dripping wet. Oh, and if you do get in it’s one of those with a lock at each end, so close both and make sure to unlock both when you leave. Although there’s hoist access into the pool, it’s fixed not to give access to the jacuzzi. I managed to get in the jacuzzi by transfer, but the start button is on the wall 5m away and you have to press it every 5 minutes to put it back on.  The play area is pretty definitively inaccessible, I have an Alber Adventure full suspension off road chair, and it couldn't do this at all. We took part in the Family Fun Quest for which we paid, and were told fully accessible, but it was about 40% accessible"
3818,"Although there are blue badge spaces near the store, these are far to few in number and the majority of the time I have been unable to park there"
3819,We are getting the measure of changing places toilet as Clacket lane(M25) has them East Bound only and Fleet Westbound only. South Mimms also has changing places. Have a radar key  Tesco's at new Milton has a Changing Places WC and Milford on Sea are also in the process of building one( likely opening Easter 2020)
3820,"This branch of Muji had a broken lift on the day I visited, so I was only able to access half of the shop, the ground floor."
3821,I could see two disabled bays close to entrance.
3822,We were delighted with the staff at the restaurant. Having been to another restaurant the night before where our experience as disabled people was not great the welcome we received at Favorita was fabulous!   The waiter helped reading the meaning and explaining the dishes and was happy to take time doing this which made a big difference to our experience.  Everyone was friendly and we will be going back! 
3823,"Could not have been more friendly or disabled aware - whilst sheltering from a rain storm, 3 members of staff asked me if I needed them to get a chair."
3824,Accessible rooms are ok but only one has a wetroom - all the others have baths. Also could do with some power sockets near the bed. Staff are v friendly however and restaurant is accessible.  Main let down is how you access the NEC without a car - there is no pedestrian path and you need to offroad it through a hole in a fence to get there. Not great for the many Naidex exhibition visitors. Just needs a path to be constructed!
3825,"The O2 Arena in Greenwich is a major venue for events of many kinds, from music to sport. Using the site of the Millennium Dome, it's been designed with excellent access in mind. As well as the Arena, the site also houses the smaller indigO2, which is accessible though has not been visited for this review, as well as a cinema and exhibition centre. There are also a wide variety of bars and restaurants, all of which are accessible."
3826,The staff at Broadmarsh are all very friendly and willing to offer help and support to all customers.
3827,The gondolas are wheelchair accessible with your carer going with you for free. I was in a manual wheelchair but there was a person in a power chair at the top too. The staff slow the gondola down when you reach the top ensuring you can get off without rushing. The restuarant at top is fully accessible with a ramp & a balcony so the views are amazing - you are 650metres up Annach Mor mountain next to Ben Nevis.
3828,This is an update review of my previous visit in 2018.
3829,A wheelchair accessible airport with several accessible restaurant and shop. Also has amazing staff.
3830,Excellent. Very helpful indeed.
3831,This time I was dropped off by taxi at the front door. Buses from the north and west of the city travel along Renfrew Street which is to the side of the hotel. There is an NCP car park close by.
3832,"They were excellent, nothing was a problem."
3833,They are well maintained but also well used - wouldn't hurt to have a few more around the park. 
3834,"The whole building is level, step free and doors are wide."
3835,There is step free access to the front of the hotel. It has automatic doors. There is lift access to the different floors.
3836,"There's 4 steps to the main entrance with a handrail on the left hand side as you walk in, but there is also a wheelchair lift which is operated by reception staff. Once inside there is spacious foyer area with chairs. The event I attended was held in a large hall which was arranged with rows of chairs. Both rooms were spacious and I was able to move easily with my crutch without bumping into furniture. The event I attended had live subtitles."
3837,Very friendly and non-discriminatory.
3838,"The good thing about this venue is that all the shops are in one place, and really easy to access. The shops encompassed in this Park are: Sainsburys (which I use a lot), an M&S outlet, B&M Brothers, a Mecca Bingo (which I haven't patronised), a TK-Maxx and a branch of Poundland.  There is also a KFC."
3839,"The palace is in extensive grounds. From the entrance gates there is a drive with vehicle access to the palace. The path slopes upwards to the house. On arriving at the house there are steps or ramp to the entranceway. Inside there is a lift to the first floor, providing step free access, which you can operate independently without staff being present. Alternatively there is a staircase, with handrail on one side, see photo. There are some Roman objects and other artefacts on display."
3840,There were plenty of ramps for wheelchair users and  a lot of signs.
3841,Access at the eastern end of the trail is by gently sloping ramp. It is also possible to join or leave the trail at the Jardin de Reuilly and there are two places in the western section of the trail wher lift access is available.
3842,"Front of house and café  staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful.   I spoke with Lewis about the Tranquillity exhibition. He listed to what I said. I also asked to speak to the manager, as I wanted to feedback formally what I would be saying in my review. Richard, the manager quickly came to see me. Both listened to my concerns. The issue of covid safety is under consent review at Wellcome and they will consider what additional measures could be put in place."
3843,Staff were very nice and brought my drink to me.
3844,"Not just a garden centre, but a lovely restaurant and a number of small individual shops all on one site"
3845,There is one available on the ground level. It is very old school. Very low toilet. Very few grab rails in useful places.
3846,"Good new-looking scooter that was easy to use and worked well on public transport. I chose the more powerful 10 kph option with a long range, and it never felt in danger of running out of battery charge."
3847,"We decided to visit the  Tower of London on our visit to London. We are a family of two adults and four children. My husband has MS and our youngest son is undiagnosed ASD. I had looked on their website and found they have yellow lanyards for hidden disabilities. They responded to my emails quickly and answered any questions I had. We booked our tickets online and I was able to get a free carers ticket with proof of my husband's disability when we arrived. Both my husband and my son were given a yellow lanyard which meant we were able to skip the queues. There wasn't much of a queue to gain entry but the queue for the Crown Jewels was really long. I approached a member of staff who immediately spoke with a colleague and took us to the front of the queue. We were taken through a different entrance and then straight to the front of the queue. They were so helpful and professional,nothing was any trouble. We had a great time at the Tower of London,made so much easier by their approach to hidden disabilities. Fantastic!"
3848,Bit of a bump to get in the front door but doable. Once you are in the bar itself is not built for people in wheelchairs.
3849,"Reception was especially helpful, and the young lady that escorted us as we viewed the hotel was very kind and helpful, made our visit interesting as we prepared to review this lovely hotel."
3850,"The Royal Mile (the street the venue is on) is a hill, and the road is cobbles in places, so takes a bit more effort if in a wheelchair.  The Whiskey Experience has a flat entrance  from the pavement and an automatic door. The entrance/ticket desk is low, so can be reached from a wheelchair.  We were going on a tour, which starts with a 'Barrel ride,' we were impressed they had a wheelchair accessible 'barrel.' For this, there is ramped access into the front of the barrel. There is room for one person in a wheelchair and one carer/friend to sit in it. From the outside, it looks exactly the same as the other barrels. It follows a track to take you on a short ride explaining the history and processes of whiskey.  It is a smooth ride, moving fairly slowly, it's not scary. There are some flashing/bright lights, but say to a member of staff if this is a concern (it's also possible just not to go on the ride if you choose).  There is only one accessible barrel, perhaps having another would be good especially if you were visiting in a group with more than one person in a wheelchair.   In each of the rooms you go into on the tour, there is room for at least two wheelchairs, and at all times you are made to feel part of the group no matter your needs.  There is lift access to the different floors.  Information is presented in different ways, using technology, film clips, staff talking, sound and lights. We particularly liked the scratch-and-sniff cards which explained about the different regions of Scotland different Whiskeys come from. Having this mix may suit people's needs, or just keep people's interest! It's quite multi-sensory and interactive.  While talking to staff, they said how keen they were that the Whiskey Experience is accessible. They said they now have British Sign Language and American Sign Language tours available."
3851,Staff are very happy to help and there's always someone around. They made sure I knew where the facilities were and they were very friendly.  
3852,"There was plenty of space to manoeuvre in the toilet, grab rails in suitable places and plenty of space for a carer. The sink was located at a suitable height. The restaurant itself is quite large and spacious, and the toilets are separated therefore be sure to ask for a table nearby the toilets if the distance could cause a problem."
3853,"This would be a full 5 if it was not for the lack of lower seating and tables  in the nightclub, however the staff were very happy to make the effort to carry drinks and conscious of wheelchair users being lower than the bar and didn't over look anyone waiting to be served."
3854,Staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. 
3855,Difficult to get dropped off near this place but there is  a dropped curb directly opposite the entrance.
3856,Apart from the step at the front door there is good access and the pub and bar is spacious and a nice place to be. 
3857,Good amount of parking close by.  The train station is a 5 minute walk (maximum) across the road.  Unsure about the bus service as I didn’t use it.
3858,Staff were friendly and helpful.   We felt very welcome.
3859,"There is one disabled car parking space by the museum, but other car parking is much further away. There are bus stops on each side of the road directly by both venues, and these are the best option for getting to and from the venue. There are no nearby train stations"
3860,It's all on one level
3861,Disabled parking outside each home.
3862,"There is only one disabled toilet which is at reception. There are other toilets in the grounds, but only one is at ground level."
3863,Staff are always friendly and helpful 
3864,"We found all the staff very willing, most are young, but really kind and helpful. They all made sure we could have any support needed, so thank you to the staff."
3865,"Five Guys has great, true american style burgers that a cooked from fresh. The Salted Caramel Milkshake is to die for. The staff are helpful and brought my food to the table when I asked without hesitation. The layout is open plan and there is more than enough space for a wheelchair to get around comfortably, with places to sit. The music I found to be a bit loud, which could be a problem for someone with sensory impairments, but personally it was a pleasant experience.. That was until I had to use the bathroom, which are down a set of steep winding stairs, that I found difficult. I looked for a disabled toilet and as far as I could see this was not a consideration, or at the very least it was not sign posted. This is why Five Guys is only getting three stars as I find that it is a massive oversight and accessibility requirement.  "
3866,Always found staff very friendly in Braehead. Especially the mobility staff members.
3867,Excellent. Large concrete ramp out the back 
3868,Driving necessary. Car park has disabled section nearest ticket office and loos. Charge for car park (tickets issued as you drive in). Car park reasonably level.
3869,Helpful & accommodating - went out of their way.
3870,The staff at Jake's Bar and Restaurant and at Lochanhully were all really good and very helpful.
3871,"A spacious disabled toilet can be accessed in the main Foodhall shopping area a short distance from the café, signposted clearly.  It has adequate space for carers and wheelchairs, it was very clean and tidy and well stocked. The facility had grab rails around the toilet (one drop down rail on the right side) and sink area, a pull cord for assistance if required was clearly visible to the left of the toilet.  The low sink enabled easy access with lever action taps for ease of use."
3872,There is a large car park with five blue badge spaces. 
3873,Very good. If in main toilets.
3874,"Clean, tidy and spacious."
3875,Staff are very friendly and most willing to help in any way that they can.
3876,"All the staff couldn't be more helpful.  I usually go in a motorised and then transfer to my wheelchair to watch the show.  Staff are very happy to drive my scooter to a safe spot and are always on hand to bring it back should I need it. They help you get entry into the building, accompany you in the lifts, organise to bring drinks to you at the interval and make sure you are comfortable in your seat. I have had many different members of staff helping me and they have all been brilliant.  There must be a extremely good training programme in place.  Outstanding service."
3877,The restaurant itself  is very spacious and well laid out. The main doors are quite heavy so you would require assistance to open these. The accessible toilet has handrails but is quite small once you’re inside. There is also a sharp corner to turn off the main Cafe To get into the main toilet
3878,"Once in the park all one level, playground, skateboard park, beach and splash and play."
3879,"The staff are a delight, when my coffee arrived it was a cup that my pesky hand was struggling to use. Not only did the staff member give me a different cup that was better for me but they brewed fresh coffee to put in rather than just pour the existing coffee into it. Throughout our stay the staff of warm, courteous and friendly and I felt very welcome."
3880,Access to Central Station is easy by public transport.
3881,"There are automatic doors into the garden centre, and other doors within are also automatic. There is plenty of space to manoeuvre a wheelchair. Apart from one small area situated upstairs, there is step-free access throughout, to areas both indoors and outdoors. The cafe is fully accessible."
3882,"The Barbican has a number of venues (I haven't been to them all) including 3 cinemas, a theatre and music venue.  I've been there countless times over the past couple of years. The venue is very accessible and caters for disabled guests extremely well."
3883,"Depending on where you go paths can be muddy with puddles. Paths are not smooth, some areas have cobble stones. Grass is often saturated and inaccessible. The park has two trampers available though which you could either pay £25 a year for or pay £5.30 an hour (£20 refundable deposit...first hour free). The trampers are located outside the shop. Some areas are inaccessible due to steps or building works. Signs were okay but they could use more signs in larger print. Some paths had gates which weren't too heavy to open but they did have an awkward latch.  First set of doors into cafe remained open. Second set of doors were closed. Both doors needed to be opened for my power chair go get through. Doors were manual and mildly heavy. Counter was not too high from a power chair. Card machine can be moved. Food and drinks can be brought to table.  Shop doors were closed with no bell to request assistance, however doors were facing the tills so at least a member of staff could see you. Ramp into shop was steep. Could get round shop in power chair fairly easily."
3884,Parking can be hit & miss. We tend to go midweek. Luckily if we cannot use a disabled space we can park on an end so I can easily get out of our WAV.  There is a local bus stop out side on the main road but how accessible it is to villages around I cannot comment.  The garden centre is in a rural village.
3885,The staff do what they can to assist people with disabilities to board the vessel and to assist them while on board the vessel as well.
3886,Went to see a concert there at the end of Oct. Staff were helpful on the phone before and at the event its self
3887,"Automatic door finally working but still.have to go to fire exit door, press button and wait for someone to.open door so.that you can get up ramp. If you are in chair you have to sit at back with no seats for anyone to.sit next to you. Could be better "
3888,There is No Customer Toilet in store however there is automatic self cleaning toilet around 40 meter on the Main St to the left as you exit the store this is at the end of the Blue Badge Parking area on the Main st  This can be opened using a Radar Key 
3889,"I score the park a three and a half simply as the access from the most popular approach, Princes Street, is not very good for the majority of disabled people. One day the Council might install an access ramp with a gentle gradient and make life easier for wheelchair users, young parents with buggies, and others with mobility impairments."
3890,Only not 5 for lack of signage. If you have a reasonable sense of direction you could start the walk from anywhere and there are two bridges across the river so easy to make a circular route on smooth wide paths. 
3891,Very friendly and knowledgable. Asked customers at the wheelchair table to move to another location when we came in although we didn't have a reservation. Appreciated the staff asking and the customers agreeing to move!
3892,"The staff were very welcoming, helpful and were proactive in offering assistance. They informed me of the house and gardens lay out. They told me about and gave me a map for an accessible route round the gardens. They offered to help me with the stairs. All the staff were very friendly and helpful from reception, room stewards to waitresses in the tea rooms. The staff really put themselves out to help and I believe would do their best to assist any guest with a disability to make the most of their visit despite the limitations of the buildings layout."
3893,We were really welcome and dressing up in all the uniform and equipment all at the same time and scampering about in it were not a problem. Very friendly place indeed and totally inclusive from our experience.
3894,The staff at the hotel were amazing and very willing to help.
3895,"Automatic doors FINALLY working but still have to go to Fire Exit door, press button and wait for someone to.open door, which you have to.push open. "
3896,"We visited Chester's Fort because it is an English Heritage site and we are members. With hindsight, some of the other Hadrian's Wall attractions are probably better for wheelchair access. We had a lovely visit but I was very limited in what I could access."
3897,4 disabled spaces in street outside but very close to lots of main bus routes 
3898,"The hotel entrance is situated on Meuse Lane opposite McDonald's. By foot, turn onto South St Andrew Street and turn left into Meuse Lane, the hotel is 20m on the right. Parking was quite hard to find as there are no directions but parking is available at the nearby Q-Park car park, Greenside Row, EH1 3AN, Edinburgh"
3899,We'd been nearby on Baker Street and hadn't realised how close Regent's Park was. There's lots of bus stops nearby and there was disabled parking signposted on the map of the area.
3900,"Vary spacious even when busy. Lifts, escalotors or a ramp to access the roads around the station. "
3901,Staff are not particularly friendly or helpful - some are nicer than others.
3902,There are a number of Blue Badge spaces just down the street from the shop this is to the left as you exit the shop there is also a car park in Church St however this is on a hill. In both these cases Blue Badge spaces fill up rather quickly and are never empty for long during peek periods during the day.  The Asda Store about car park is about 10 mins away however there is a time limit on this area 
3903,"Within the site, access with a wheelchair was easy - the worst was the paving outside the entrance/exit. Not suitable for mobility scooters because of narrowish paths and sharp corners. A couple of Small steps into buildings (eg the model train layout) but not insurmountable. Plenty of seats and picnic areas."
3904,Staff seemed friendly and helpful.
3905,"Access is good, with ramped access, you need to book an accessible rooms as there are floors and sections of floors that only have access via stairs - There are 2 lifts, but they are very small - and a power chair user may struggle - Also the corridor in the room once opened is very narrow (700mm wide) approx"
3906,Great wet room and toilet. Shower chair and hand rails provided.
3907,"Richmond Theatre usually host weekly productions of plays or musicals by professional touring companies, as well as a traditional pantomime at Christmas. The theatre is in a beautiful Victorian building designed by Frank Matcham, the leading theatre architect of his day. The theatre step free access to the stalls."
3908,A wheelchair accessible restaurant with friendly/helpful staff. Good food and great value.
3909,On arrival they were helpful and we were shown to the level entry side door and queued to use the lift down to the stalls. Once we were shown to out seats no more staff appeared to offer assistance even though we were told they would.
3910,Staff in the information centre were very informative. Staff opened doors for us and pointed us in the right direction when we asked them
3911,"The older ferries all have disabled toilets, a bit grubby with hard to open doors but with handrails and emergency cords. The new ferry has a large disabled toilet with plenty of room for a wheelchair and a carer or two. It has ample handrails, both fixed and pull down, an easily accessible sink and a well placed mirror. Each time I have used it, it has been clean and tidy. No RADAR key is necessary"
3912,"No particular parking, but parked well enough to have chair access. "
3913,All bathroom facilities are accessible. Grab rails at the loos. 
3914,Looking for somewhere that little bit different we stumbled across the Scottish Story Telling Centre's Cafe. At first you don't know where to enter but inspecting the signs on the building wall there's an accessible route signposted.
3915,Very helpful
3916,The only thing is that the corridor in the toilets wouldn’t be wide enough for wheelchairs and equipment that we may need to use because the corridor was very narrow. Non wheelchair users will be ok to get down and around the corridor.
3917,Good access although a bit bumpy on the cobbles. Chairs need moving to fit a wheelchair in but is roomy enough to create space. It is tidy and organised. Automatic doors at the entrance.
3918,"Excellent, very friendly and willing, and I can assure you they will support you all the way."
3919,I am aware that there is a bus stop at the back of the centre next to the car park and there is also one out the front. It is on the main road running through Blackburn towards Bathgate and stands out quite well. At the back of the centre there is fair sized car park which is shared with the Partnership Centre. Unfortunately there are not many disabled parking spaces who those who need them. The nearest train station is in Bathgate which is approximately a  45 minute walk away.
3920,Plenty of bus options going through Gorgie Road but fairly difficult to get parked in that area.
3921,"I arrived here by train only, and directions were easy to find to reach the next platform. I have also arrived here by London Underground which was straightforward and clearly signposted."
3922,"Level entry and double doors to access. Doors are heavy and not automatic but they are by reception desk and the staff are always on the lookout for musicians with equipment so are really fast to open the doors and welcome you in. All studio spaces have wide enough doors to comply with access requirements and its all on the level. One of the rooms has a stage area which does not have wheelchair access but the staff are quick and efficient at configuring the room to suit by placing drumkit, mics etc on the floor level area if no other room is available. Lighting levels are low throughout."
3923,"This was my first time visiting the SEC, I’m a regular at the Hydro though so knew the parking at the venue wasn’t great. We parked across at The Village Hotel where we also went for tea (see separate review). This is a long walk if you have mobility problems, but in my powerchair it was smooth and easy, it took about 5 minutes to get there. "
3924,3 wide accessible spaces.  Tel no on website to book ahead. Level access into museum. 
3925,"Firstly I used the zoos website 'contact us' link 3 days prior to our visit but no one replied to my query.   The young member of staff who served us when we arrived was what can only be described as patronising,  She demanded proof of disability ESA/PIP letter so as myself and carer could gain the concessionary rate, to the point of saying that even though I was on holiday I should always carry these documents with me in order to get the concession.. Some staff training would be of benefit here; nobody will spend £2000 on a wheelchair in order to save £12, also expecting someone to carry personal documents which could leave them open to identity theft if lost isn't good advice either.   We weren't offered a map or any information that would make our visit easier.  Upon leaving my wife noticed a small notice on the outer door saying that some of the surfaces were uneven and may be difficult to access (huge understatement) however this was on the door that was open so would not have been seen upon arrival..!"
3926,The staff I  met were very helpful and showed me which way to go and helped to explain how the ticketing system worked.
3927,"Great cafe in The Lake District. Wonderful food and a nice arty gift shop, with accessible toilet. "
3928,Disabled toilet on ground level but need code to gain entry
3929,From the pavement the approach is a flat and levelled surface. Entrance has a large control pad/button to open the door. The pool has a hoist facility.
3930,We were on level 2 where the accessible toilet was so clean and well-equipped. The doors open automatically at the push of a button. The only reason it doesn't get a perfect score is because the mirror is at a standing height rather than being full length.
3931,"There is street level access from the car park with lowered curbs and wide paths. There's automatic doors to the right hand side at the main entrance however the last few visits on of the doors has been sticking as we've tried to open it and it's needed a bit of a push to get it fully open. This wasn't difficult though and didn't require much strength. The cinema itself is all one level with wide doors. As mentioned above, the fire doors to the screens are quite heavy. "
3932,"Level access into cafe/shop but there are doors. There's a tarmac path from the car park (opp side to the cafe) onto the wheelchair accessible route. The map available in the cafe entrance (free) clearly shows the self guided routes. Although it's not described as wheelchair friendly, the route described as gentle is accessible.  There are plenty of other paths but you need robust wheels capable of off-road work to attempt them - if you can, they're great and there are fantastic views to be had."
3933,"Beautiful forest walk,lovely autumn colours, accessible paths and treetop walk. good cafe, changing places toilet."
3934,Great staff
3935,A fairly spacious accessible loo is adjacent to the lift area. It has space to manoeuvre and is clean and tidy.
3936,"Excellent, very attentive and supportive, friendly, and on the ball."
3937,"The accessible beach is well signposted, it is on street signs as well as maps.  There is a ramp from the esplanade down to the beach, the accessible area has a large wooden platform - room for quite a lot of people (your friends and family can sit with you). You can hire the use of sun loungers and umbrellas for the day if you wish.  There are accessible toilets and a lowered (outdoor) shower.  This area is also where lifeguards are stationed, so there is always help available.  They had a collection of crutches which could be used in the sand - hard to describe, but the bottom of the crutch has a flat round base so it doesn't sink into the sand as much as usual ones would (reminded me of ski poles)  There is also a sand/aqua buggy - a bit of a cross between a plastic wheelchair and a small raft! There is only one so you may need to wait your turn to use it, or it is possible to book in advance. You are assisted as much as required, by the lifeguards to use this.  Once sitting in it, there is a small ramp from the platform down to the sea. This is a safe-swimming area, and you can enjoy the freedom of being in the very clear blue water.   "
3938,"staff in visitor centre suggested that access to castle might be difficult, didn't say that it was impossible"
3939,"There is a small step into the shop, once inside it is all on one level."
3940,"We had an amazing stay as a large group. The house is perfect for wheelchair user aswell as the rest of the family. Even the animal area had a smooth concrete path. The house had plenty of lovely open plan space and was well equipped.  The hosts were extremely attentive but not over bearing, very friendly and helpful. The farm is in a beautiful location, away from it all, but town and supermarket are within easy driving distance.  I had to have a hoist delivered to the house. The hosts were helpful with arranging drop off and pick up. "
3941,They have their double doors open and level access to enter
3942,"Great access to the shops and eating places. You can spend ages just enjoying the different things to see in the knowledge that you can get in the door, move around the shops, and the people are very friendly."
3943,"Stayed as we were going on a cruise and the hotel has free parking for the duration of your cruise. Requested wheelchair accessible room for mum. No roll in shower available, just a regular shower. The roll in shower facility was communal, cold and on a different floor. Nice staff, poor wheelchair accesible room."
3944,A simple cafe with good access and circulation space. Lift to auditorium. 
3945,"An oasis of colourful calm amid the usual bustle of a Tyrolean town.  The mountains make a beautiful backdrop to these lovely gardens.  Even if you're not into horticulture (as indeed I am not), you can't fail to appreciate the shrubs, lakes, nature terraces or indeed the central cafe."
3946,"There are two entrances to this smallish restaurant, one had a nice gentle ramp, the other has level access - there isn't any specific signage - these are just the doors everyone uses"
3947,"Staff were lovely, very friendly and welcoming. When I asked about the accessible toilet I was advised about the lack of grab rails. When I went back to my seat the same member of staff asked me if the toilet had been ok for me to use. This was done in a genuine, friendly manner and was particularly appreciated as the café was busy."
3948,There are bus stops all round George Square so public bus took me straight there.
3949,"Great experience, from booking on the fone with kya who was so helpful to travelling and the assistance i got i was so happy thank you so much. only down side was the ramp was very steep and i struggled until a staff member saw i needed help otherwise would have been a 5 if they had done that first of all"
3950,"This station was part of my journey from Waterloo to Paddington. You can watch my entire journey on my youtube channel.   Briefly, the staff were great but there was a something missing element of assumption my wheels were the same size as a wheelchair and wouldn't get stuck; but there was no way I would test it in a live situation and get stuck.  A ramp was eventually deployed but at Paddington no ramp!"
3951,"They have a wheelchair bathroom! Huzzah! And it is big! However, the mirror is up way too high so if you're in a wheelchair, you'll just have to assume that you look great. Which you always do, you ride."
3952,You would need your own transport.  Large gravel carpark with disabled spaces at the entrance.  The gravel is quite compact so it's quite easy to push a wheelchair over
3953,No wheelchair access 
3954,"Very friendly staff, and help me with everything I needed help with."
3955,"The staff are adorable and will do anything to help. They made it a happy visit. If they could stop crashing into the back of my wheelchair as they pass, they would get five stars instead of four."
3956,Automatic doors to enter venue and then left turn into cafe. Tables slightly close together so might requiring some manoeuvring if using a large wheelchair however i'm sure it would be fine. Seating avaliable both inside and outside. Chairs with no arm rests which could easily be moved if using a wheelchair.  
3957,"It was lovely to be able to hire a Tramper all-terrain mobility vehicle at the site and the staff at the entrance were very helpful. ( A voluntary donation will be made online towards the hire of this). We only visited the parkland as the house and gardens were closed.  We were given a map and asked several times which of the paths we could use.   Most of the paths are fairly flat and not particuarly challenging, except for the some of gates which were a little more difficult to drive through as there were large lumps of concrete around each of the gate posts.  The disabled toilet however, had it's red cord, which is meant to be able to be accessible in an emergency, was hidden behind the sanitary bin. National Trust - this is the third place this month that I've noticed issues with the red cord - please do sort this out!  "
3958,"The park has some attractive features, some steep gradients, and the café is inaccessible to wheelchair users"
3959,Right next to the Centre. Fine.
3960,Extremely friendly and accommodating.
3961,"Very little to do with the staff however, plenty around if you were to require assistance."
3962,Easy access but red cord tied up. Left a free the red cord card. Space to transfer if required. 
3963,Great access. Step free front door - doors light & easy to use. Single door was wide enough to get through. Easily moveable furniture. Good circulation & space. Only thing was that it was a little on the dark side.
3964,"Staff are extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. They really put themselves out to look after you. Service is efficient (I was with a group)."
3965,Could not have been improved.
3966,The accessible toilet is in a room beside the other toilets it is well signposted it is large enough for a wheelchair & a carer if needed. There are plenty of grab rails in appropriate places. It was very clean & tidy. Hi o
3967,When they state accessible they really mean it here! We had no problems at all. The equipment we had asked for was all ready there. There was scones and jam waiting. The location is excellent. We walked down to the town centre twice. Lovely comfortable beds and a good wet room. Will definitely recommend them.
3968,"There is automated entrance doors, platform lift and lifts to all floors, to provide step free access.  On this visit I attended the Global Clinic tour in one of their galleries, which offered a touch tour, speech to text and BLS interpreter. Tour was very inclusive and met the needs of disabled people with a wide variety of needs.  "
3969,Lift to the rear of the building which allows access to all floors. Request made to Doorman who promptly arranged for a member of staff to open the back door to obtain entry
3970,"sufficient space, but maybe a good driver will have no problems moving around however I had fun with reversing out of the toilet near the cafe.  Bars and rails.   a chair in the toilet."
3971,"The cottage is all on one level, there is an external ramp to the decked veranda area but you can also access this straight from the lounge.  Access to the front door is level with the car park and all internal rooms are level access.  We didn't require particular visual or hearing assistance/aids."
3972,The staff were friendly and efficient.
3973,Keith in reception was welcoming but not really clued up accessibility.
3974,Nearest parking would probably be Castle Terrace behind the Usher Hall. There is a bus stop right outside that has buses stopping every few minutes. 
3975,"Wide, open foyers a bars as well as easy wheelchair access to building and to auditorium."
3976,Parking was near to the ship and taxis could stop right outside the reception
3977,"Great for getting around the hotel,plenty of lifts and restaurants were all easily accessible."
3978,Luxurious chocolate lounge with exhibition and shop in Grandtully. Good wheelchair access throughout and delicious chocolate treats!
3979,"Decent size, doubles as baby change. No red cord."
3980,"On the whole we found access very good,  Restaurants and shops made an effort to ensure that thee=re was space for wheelchairs, moving things out of the way were needed."
3981,"We stayed overnight in our motorhome at this venue and then did the walk as soon as it opened in the morning (10:00). It was challenging for me, but more because I have a phobia of nettles than because of wheelchair access. I had checked out the quality of the path before deciding to visit and had come to the conclusion that, being quite a short walk and a firm surface, I would be able to manage. I used my normal wheelchair with Freewheel."
3982,Staff are slow to respond and seemingly nonchalant when it comes to meeting our needs.
3983,Level access into the hotel plenty room to move 
3984,There is a large car park with disabled parking near the entrance to the Gardens and also outside the Restaurant. Ramps to get into restaurant
3985,The staff was very friendly and helpful. 
3986,Large clean toilet. 
3987,"Hampton Court Castle has been standing among it's pastures and parkland beside the River Lugg for 600 years. The Castle was rescued in the 1990's by an American Millionaire who furnished it magnificently according to his idea of how an English country manor should look. The original Victorian garden walls now enclose stunning new flower gardens divided by canals, island pavilions and pleached avenues. All of venue is wheelchair accessible, except the upstairs of the Castle, the Maze and Sunken garden. There are plenty of seats to stop, rest and enjoy the view, as well as a restaurant, gift shop, ice cream parlour and bar.  "
3988,A modern leisure centre with good facilities  for disabled patrons.
3989,Level access throughout. The entrance has an automatic door with the wheelchair button to the side. Some of the exhibit rooms have dull lighting to create an atmosphere which I think would make it a little more difficult for people with a visual impairment. The cafe is a good size and easy to manoeuvre around.
3990,"On site the accessible toilet is accessed via a shared entrance hall to the Ladies.  The space is good and well lit with all support rails present. No key needed. The nearest changing places toilet is in Ashford Gateway, several miles away. "
3991,"My wife and i visited here for a concert,from parking to getting into the venue was very good.I have attended other venue's and they have been poor compared to here,and the seating we had was excellent for viewing the stage with no one in the way."
3992,"There are steps at the front entrance to the building but if you phone in advance which is what the owner Barry asked me to do in future they will have the side entrance prepared for wheel chair access. they could not have been more welcoming and obliging when helping us into the restaurant.  my only problem and this is not Canmore houses fault is with the pavements on route to and from the car park, Fife Council really need to address this problem and soon as every couple of yards there is a raised drain cover or a  patch of Tarmac missing. we manged it but my mate is still young fit and healthy I have friends who would have had to use the road to get there. also the dropped kerbs on route were anything but in fact we crossed th road on the way back thinking it looked smoother and there was no dropped kerb meaning my carer had to reverse me down"
3993,"Very helpful, the place has been open less than a week so they are just getting started. But they were very knowledgeable and willing to help with anything!"
3994,There is 1-2cm lip to enter off the footpath. Otherwise it is level access throughout. It is a push/pull door but staff are always there to greet you if you were needing help with the door. There is lots of space between tables to navigate the restaurant. You can either order from your table using their app or go up to the counter to design your own pizza. The counter is low but it may be difficult to see all the toppings available if using a wheelchair. 
3995,"Wide corridors and aisles all around the garden centre, shop and cafe"
3996,There is lots of pay and display parking nearby although with over 6 disabled parking bays nearby.  See picture below but the disc zones can be misleading. In order to park in those Disc zones you do need to display disc to park there for 2 hours.    The pub also has its own car park which customers can use for free although it is slightly hidden and does involve a tiny hill.   There are cobbled streets as well in and around the Jimmy Watt.   The Greenock central train station is five minute walk away. 
3997,Transport options are limited. It seemed like mostly on street parking and the street parking was fairly busy when I visited. I’m not sure how great the bus options are. The nearest train station is at Galashields and it is a 4 mile walk along country paths from there. A taxi from the train station would maybe make this a better option.
3998,"Dimitris was amazing. He was an excellent driver and tour guide, very knowledgeable and informative. He had lots of information to share about Corfu history, customs and traditions. He explained about daily life on the island and I felt I had a good insight into local life. He was extremely knowledgeable about  the flowers and fauna and especially about olive trees are cultivated.  We visited lots of hidden away villages and saw lots of things which would not have been possible on a coach tour. Dimitris is a photographer and he helped me get some wonderful photos from my trip.   Dimitris informed me that he also had been on crutches at one time and this had made him think about developing tours for people with mobility disabilities. He was extremely thoughtful by sometimes popping out of the car himself to take a photo for me or stopping the car in the perfect position so I had a great view. I felt he really understood my access needs and made assisting me appear effortless. "
3999,Plenty of accessible toilets throughout the Centre. Staff will point you in the right direction if you ask. Different layouts and sizes.
4000,There is a lift to get to the first level. 
4001,"Waterloo Station is nearby and the Jubilee Line offers step-free access but beware - the Jubilee Line lift has had severe problems for months and is frequently out of service - check before you travel! A few bus routes will drop you off in York Way, which is round the corner from County Hall."
4002,The staff are friendly.
4003,A good basic  motorway services station that offers the type of services you would expect such as tea coffee a range of different types of food available.  The fuel services are available as you exit the station. The main service building is on one level with good wide doors these were open during our visit due to the heat.
4004,"There are lots of great features in this museum. There are lots of interactive parts relating to the exhibitions. Information is given in different ways, including through film clips.  The museum is over several levels which can be accessed both by stairs and a lift. Each floor is then flat to get around.   However, entrance (& exit) is through the shop, which can be quite busy. The front doorway is flat, but it could be difficult to open the door as it isn't automatic/ doesn't have a button or bell.   This is an ideal family day out, and far from being a 'traditional' museum, it does understandably tend to have lots of excited children running around exploring it. I think it's fantastic to see children so engaged.  Others though, may find this a little chaotic, so if you prefer a quieter visit, perhaps go during school hours and avoid school holidays."
4005,We have commented on the suitability of the above holiday accommodation having booked it for 2 weeks in September 2017. We have looked at it from the perspective of having a profoundly disabled son who is totally wheelchair dependent and requires full assistance with all daily living activities.  We feel that for those wheelchair users with limited mobility or those that require some assistance with transferring from wheelchair to bed then the accommodation is more than adequate.  For those who are less able and require more assistance Cosawes Barton is suitable and has the space to accommodate lifting / transferring equipment.
4006,"The staff were really friendly and helpful. They made me feel very welcome and supported me along the way. The airport also had the use of a manual wheelchair which was useful if I wanted to take myself off to a toilet. I liked that after security the team offered to take me on a route through the duty free shops which is something that wasn't offered at Heathrow and some other UK shops. I have felt previously that I would have liked to have seen the shops and this was a great idea. The team also left me in a restaurant and reassured me the time they would pick me up. They also found the restaurant manager so I didn't have to go up to the bar and order. Above and beyond! The only thing I would say that the disabled toilet didn't have a powered door. Therefore, it made it slightly difficult manoeuvring in and out of the toilet with a wheelchair. "
4007,"It was all on same level, and plenty of space around the tables."
4008,On street parking 
4009,Good professional banking staff 
4010,We wheeled across to George Square having arrived at the nearby station not sure what we'd find. It's a great open space and easy to find a spot to sit and watch the world go by.
4011,Perfectly adequate
4012,staff were friendly and helpful
4013,"They have worked incredibly hard to make the building as accessible as possible. There is level access from the street, although the hill getting to the main door is pretty steep!  It does at times feel a little disjointed internally, as you have to pop on and off a couple of lifts while in there if you want to get to the snacks etc. but it's well worth it!"
4014,"The ""Tent"" staff were very good. A warm welcome on arrival and a conversation to see where I'd prefer to sit - up front or at the back. I went for the back and the staff were quick to move chairs and make sure I and my companions were happy."
4015,I came by bus (Lothian 44) and then had to roll through the residential area to get to the pub. Taxis can drop off right outside.
4016,Very friendly and efficient.
4017,It's really good but the lift isn't big enough for a few people to get in with the wheelchair!
4018,"Level access in and plenty space around tables for powerchairs to maneovre. To get to the lift and till on ground floor this is a slight incline (no handrails) which might be a bother for some. Alternatively, two steps with handrails. Signage was very clear for what floor has what genres of books, and for where the toilets are."
4019,"Loo in room too small to transfer, no grab rails anywhere. Couldn't find accessible loo in main building, too many steps."
4020,"Getting in the building was easy once you realise that on the western side (the side furthest up the hill) and in the old building that forms John Knox House you will find a level access wide doorway. Once inside it is level access on the 'street' floor and this gives you access to the shop, reception, cafe, an accessible loo and large open performance space.   A lift can take you to the lower floor if visiting the 'theatre' space where there's level access in to the front row of the seats. Seats can be removed to make ample space for wheelchair users. Interestingly and excitingly the stage area can be ramped if you happen to be a performer who requires wheelchair access. The lift also takes you to the upper floor and. smaller performance space in the library. There were accessible toilets on each floor with different layouts and sizes.  All of the performance areas had induction loops for hearing impaired visitors should they require them. The programme of performances and events included signed events and performances.   The cafe; as well as providing delicious cakes, had moveable furniture and helpful staff who were happy to carry food and beverages to the table.  Oh yes, the reception has a nice dropped counter too - no putting my chin on the reception desk as I try to have a conversation."
4021,The is plenty of disabled parking spaces next to the entrance. The parking bays are wide and the kerbs up onto the pavement are dropped to allow easy access for users
4022,"Called in here on a long journey south. There are plenty coffee shops in Aviemore so we went with a familiar name, as we're regulars in their Marchmont branch. Sadly the number of customers must have a bearing on quality. Over strong coffee served in brimming cups.....how do you avoid spilling some on the first sip?? Rock hard scones served with over soft butter and pre packed jam. Left both coffee and scone."
4023,no toilets onboard but there are nearby use a radar key
4024,Very friendly and willing to assist and accommodate.
4025,"The staff vary from (occasionally) very friendly to (generally) disgustingly rude & insulting. The staff on Platform 15 are exceptionally rude and unhelpful, and often astonishingly ignorant about the correct and safe way to deploy a wheelchair ramp.   Staff can be very elusive - many times I have got stuck on a train waiting for someone to turn up with a ramp to let me off. They either don't get the message that has been transmitted, or they ignore it. This is very frustrating and annoying.  I dread using this station, because of the attitude of the staff."
4026,"Each stand, the hospitality suites, the Club store, and the Hibernian Learning Centre all have accessible areas. There are several standard  lifts and some platform lifts to gain access. Detailed information is available on  the web at www.hdsa.org.uk"
4027,Straightforward for us. Staff were very helpful directing us where to go and holding open doors etc.
4028,There is a large number of staff employed in the centre however the staff my self and my wife spoke to were very helpful. As we entered by the Sauchiehall St door we stopped to  read the information board with in a minute of doing so one of the security staff asked if we needed any help. A while latter the same security  noticed me trying to get my Radar key out of my pocket and opened the toilet for me .
4029,"The owners Tina and Chris have only recently bought Boundary Farm and refurbished the cottages for their first guests at Easter 2017.   They are keen to encourage wheelchair users, they responded very quickly to the few queries we had and thanked us for our suggestions.   If you have questions about the suitability of the accommodation for you, I would encourage you to ring and speak to them.    "
4030,"Great garden with various bars a food stalls in the heart of Edinburgh Fringe Festival, also including level access venue where we watch Al Murray: The Pub Landlord's Saloon."
4031,An excellent day travelling behind a steam engine from Whitby to Pickering with 3 hours to explore the town. Helpful friendly staff helped me enjoy the journey in 1950's rolling stock.
4032,"Very accessible, all on one level Chinese restaurant in Lerwick. Food very good. "
4033,There was a rear automatic door near the toilets but I couldn' t see the way in through the fenceline for this.
4034,"Great films - current box office hits in the UK and beyond, old classics, documentaries, films you wouldn't get a chance to see, and kids films on a Sunday and in the holidays, etc. Some films are in foreign languages with subtitles- if you want to try a film in a language other than your own, comedies are a good bet or ask for recommendations. Disabled people can show their bus pass and their assistant gets a free ticket. Staff are friendly (without being patronising ) and go out of their way to accommodate. Membership reduces prices of film, food, snacks, non alcoholic drinks and DVDs. Good cheap food,  and big selection of drinks and snacks. Easy access throughout the building."
4035,"This was very problematic. Firstly the accessible toilet is not sign posted. It is in a corridor behind a door marked staff only. One of my own colleague told me off for going into an area marked staff only, see photo. When I went through this door I found that a trolley was blocking the accessible toilet. This happened twice during my stay. When I went into the toilet for the first time there was a stair climber wheelchair, which took up most of the space in the toilet, I was told this was there as it had been used the day before. I explained that the accessible toilet should not be used as a store room.  This was removed before my second loo break. The toilet had grab rails and was clean. The emergency cord didn't reach to the ground. "
4036,"Very good, has disabled parking outside the doors"
4037,"The venue has been adapted so that anyone is able to access the aquarium, an example of this would be that they have a separate entrance for those who need wheelchair access which is fitted with a ramp. Most of the exhibitions are accessible by ramps for everyone with there also being some areas with steps to allow all visitors to spread out when looking into the different exhibits. In addition to this there are elevators on all levels of the attraction including one to the wheelchair friendly restaurant. The restaurant was well spaced out and easy to move round in. The staff also pointed out when we arrived the different options they provide to allow all visitors to have a good time, this included equipment such as portable wheelchairs, walking aids and an audio guide or a staff member to guide you around. All the staff where friendly and willing to help when asked questions which allowed for a good experience visiting The Deep. "
4038,The bus is the transport - and it was great!
4039,"Great site. Visited several times . Staff great, whole place disabled friendly. Good sized accessible loo in clubhouse. Ramps everywhere making sharing family holiday inclusive for all. Parking alongside caravans. Weymouth too is very disabled friendly with lots to do and places to go. M.v freedom have a converted catamaran which organises boat trips for disabled too. The trips are free though they appreciate a donation as it is charity run. Our grandson who has autism cane with us  and thoroughly enjoyed himself."
4040,"A very interesting and well presented exhibition, great staff and very welcoming. Lost a couple of points simply becuase there's no close proximity parking ( not really their fault as the landscape doesn't really allow it )."
4041,There is a ramp to get into the chalet
4042,This is a review from my mum of the sports facility as the vaccination centre. She has a hidden impairment and told me about her experience with herself and me (wheelchair user) in mind.
4043,As a mode of transport it was great you’ve got to be able to walk up the gang plank.
4044,"Every London black cab is equipped with a wheelchair ramp. This sounds like great news. The reality is different. For most cabs:  (1) The ramps are terribly flimsy.   (2) They are always too short, with the result that when deployed on most kerbs they are far too steep to be either safe or comfortable.   (3) There is too little headroom to enter the taxi comfortably while seated in your wheelchair.   (4) It can take a long time to deploy the ramp - they get stuck, and drivers often mislay the key needed to unlock the ramp for deployment.   (5) Once you're inside the cab, there isn't room to turn around, so inevitably you emerge from the cab backwards down a very steep slope, which can be terrifying and is certainly not safe, even when a well-meaning cab driver is guiding you with his hands on the wheelchair handles. On one occasion a driver yanked me roughly down the ramp, with the result that my wheelchair (with me in it) fell off the ramp sideways. Luckily I wasn't injured and my wheelchair wasn't damaged, but it could have turned out very differently.  NB there is one model of London black cab which offers a big improvement on the above problems, it's the 'Vista Comfort Plus' model. It has a long ramp, which is not steep, it has enough headroom and is more spacious inside. It is a MUCH more wheelchair-friendly experience. The longer ramp gives a much less steep ride into the cab and feels much safer. Unfortunately there are not many of this model of cab on the roads. "
4045,Amazing. Couldn't be faulted at all. Everything was just so 'normal'. From booking tickets. To collecting tickets. To getting to our seats. To ordering drinks at the bar. There was no need for any extra help or assistance - everything just worked brilliantly. And our seats were easy to access and had a great view too - what more could we ask! It's also very reasonable to go as the cost of tickets is subsidised for disabled patrons and people accompanying them.
4046,Excellent parking and staff was right there to help and meet and greet
4047,Very wheelchair friendly place with large rooms for ease of access & moving around. Very helpful friendly staff. Meals & dietry needs are met with every meal.  Clean rooms with plenty of tea & coffee facilities. Wet room is large.  Will definately visit again.
4048,Doors are electric & automatic. Level access throughout.   Aisles are extremely cluttered. Shelves are chest style with lids with shelves set above them. Really difficult to access in a chair.   There is one accessible trolley that they are using for covid supplies. 
4049,Doubles as baby change. Red cord was tied up when visited.
4050,"What a wonderful place and the most wonderful host Moira . Everything is good quality and spotlessly clean. Ensuite spacious bedrooms with hoist and tracking,profile beds with padded cot sides if needed, out of this world shower chair that fully reclines. Spa bath with fully automated bath chair, anything we needed Moira produced it. Fully wheelchair accessible with plenty of turning room. Under floor heating, fully equipped kitchen, large garden with beautiful views across the countryside , laundry facilities and dogs made very welcome.  Thank you Moira for making us so welcome...you are a very special lady.  Hope to see you next year. "
4051,"The town, walk along the tops and the gardens were mostly flat and a good surface. We enjoyed quite a long walk and would have gone further north but there was road works and a truck on the footpath so we turned back. The access routes to the beach were very steep and most had steps. It's a shame as paths could have been built better, but they have probably been there a very long time. "
4052,"We encountered one accessible toilet. It was spacious and well-equipped with grab rails and accessible wash basin. There was room for side transfer, but the toilet had no alarm system. "
4053,Radar-operated accessible loo in the courtyard of the visitor centre. not the cleanest but OK. 
4054,"The nearest bus stop is on The Avenue, opposite Leonard Horner Hall. There is no parking directly at the venue, however, parking is on street nearby. The nearest car park with designated blue badge bays is located at the Centre for Sports and Exercise opposite the University main reception/bus terminal, however, this is a few minutes away and has a steep hill between it and the Union building, so is unlikely to be especially suitable."
4055,"Wide lobby with automatic doors; lifts readily accommodating wheelchair or electric buggy; had accessible room which had amazing views, enough room to move around, and wet room."
4056,"Disabled public toilets are in the bar lounge area, on the level, and big enough to help you cope, with grab handles and pull cord"
4057,Staff were excellent.
4058,"Lift big, more one disabled toilet both wheelchair accessible, staff helpful."
4059,There are many bus stops nearby on Princes Street as well street parking within the central reservation along George Street. 
4060,Victoria tube station is right next toit and it is accessible.
4061,"Enough space for a mobility scooter, lots of handy grab rails, very clean and tidy plenty of space for multiple people"
4062,"Having a walk in shower made it accessible for me, there was a lift. The step up to the bathroom made it less accessible and I'm 6ft and I even found the bed very high. It made it difficult to get dress in the morning."
4063,Very helpful and happy to direct me and answer questions I had about most accessible routes to exit.
4064,Helpful and friendly staff
4065,"As far as I’m aware there isn’t a disabled toilet at this restaurant. It looked like I couldn’t get the toilets because of a high table so, I got my helper to take photos for me. They are all single cubicles and judging by the photos, plus my helpers opinion, I don’t think a wheelchair user would manage, especially if they need assistance. You can see an image of one of the toilets below.  Of course there isn’t a changing place toilet either, the closest one is in the V&A which is a 5 minute walk away and open till at least 5pm. 10pm if the V&A restaurant is open."
4066,"go in Massey avenue (top of hill), go out bottom of hill(Upper Newtownards rd(thesecurity staff let a taxi in for us although there was an event going on). Funny security guard amazed i had got a Radar key off the Internet - he had to open the Yale lock. The toilet was close to the Massey ave entrance and there is another halfway down the hill."
4067,"The staff made this venue stand out!  They are knowledgeable, approachable and willing to help in any way they can.   For Access Day 2019 there were posters, flyers, information on Euan’s Guide, several staff members with stickers in place mainly to help anyone who might need additional support and highlighted their wheelchair rental service when they noticed my crutch."
4068,"Gianicolo hill is a large park in Trastevere with ornate fountains, statues and fantastic views across the city. The hill isn't particularly steep, and a main road winds up to the viewpoint. The main issue as in much of Rome is either the lack of sidewalks, or the steep kerbs which accompany any that do exist. The road leading up to the main viewpoint from Via Garibaldi is wide and fairly quiet as it isn't by any means a main thoroughfare. We felt safe walking on the road, however not everyone may be comfortable with this. Once you reach the view point, it is a large pedestrianised square with a few stalls where you can buy a bottle of water."
4069,"Both the 3D exhibition and outside spaces are wheelchair accessible. I used a Manuel wheelchair and had to have some help getting across grass and cobble stones at a monument  but there were also paths that were relatively flat so this could have been avoided. The corridors in the venue are quite wide which made it a lot easier to navigate and turn.  The exhibition itself is about 80 minutes long and is a lot of standing (if you don’t have a wheelchair) which might be something to be aware of. The exhibition is also quite loud, dark and uses 3D glasses and effects which might be difficult for some people. It is possible to miss out this stage however and get information on boards about Bannockburn and only access the outside area (this is also free to do so). "
4070,"We parked in the normal carpark. There is access  via a dirt road for cars, to the start of the Boardwalk."
4071,Staff were very helpful and opened doors etc for me without being asked to. 
4072,"ALL staff helpful, friendly and knowledgable. I fully recommend a guide to help you to gain as much from your visit as possible "
4073,"Accessible toilet easy to find , the door is a bit difficult to manage on your own in the chair, but toilet large , clean, plenty of rails etc"
4074,this location now has a changing places toilet with hoist.  fully accessible rooms with disabled parking. very friendly staff
4075,"Every time the staff have seeing me going to the accessible toilet, they have always helped to open the door which is massively appreciated."
4076,"Staff at all points were very helpful and friendly. They helped us with a map and with how the audio guide works. The cafe folk were fabulous and gave us all the time we needed to settle, shake off the rain, and decide on whether it would be a large cake or two or maybe the enormous bacon rolls that were on offer. "
4077,Good level access. Had a bell on the other side of the door for wider chairs. 
4078,"The ARC is an arts centre and includes a cinema, theatre and a cafe. It is wheelchair accessible from street level with a lift to all floors. Has performances that are wheelchair accessible and friendly staff."
4079,There is no parking available but as it is situated on Waverley Bridge it easy to access from any bus going to Princes Street or train going to Waverley.
4080,There is no parking.
4081,"One very good toilet in sports and leisure area, however shared with the only disabled shower room. unsure how good facilities are in hotel area."
4082,I’ve been going to various events at the Albert Halls for a few years now and on every occasion the staff have never been anything other than first class. They will always make a point of making sure you get in and out the venue with the least hassle possible. On the rare occasion that an event does not have allocated seating you will still find that if you have booked a wheelchair ticket your space and that of whoever is accompanying you has still been specifically reserved for you.
4083,"Good experience with very helpful staff. The venue has a good amount of accessible parking bays. There is public transport nearby but a good 5 min walk away. The entrance was level access and had automatic doors.  Once inside the venue the doors are not automated , and are double doors that were quite awkward to negotiate with the wheelchair. The sports hall is a good size. There was also studios where they provide various activities which include seated yoga. The lighting in the studio can be altered to create different mood which I feel can be used positively creating a sensory room. The accessible dry changing facility was a very good size and had a changing bench and had tracking hoist throughout with shower area and toilet.  The wet side accessible changing area was significantly smaller but adequate. If a carer is in, it could be difficult to manage."
4084,"In the bedroom, the loo was fully accessible, with a non-slip floor, which is helpful. There is no toilet on the ground floor but there is one on the first floor (lift access) which is convenient."
4085,See photograph.
4086,"That’s what made me want to give the place a positive review because (like most theatres) the staff are so helpful. Maybe as I was on my own, the staff actively sought me out to offer help. It was done in an appropriate and genuine way. The river lit up at night and the staff kindness made it a magical evening (despite hubby being ill so I was on my own). I would really encourage disabled people to go to live theatre as it is usually more accessible than people think."
4087,"This is one disabled loo that I did use and found it excellent!  It was located in the indoor restaurants behind La Goleta and was shared by all there.    There was lots of room to get my wheelchair in and transfer, with grab rails (one pull down) on both sides.  The loo itself was also raised.  I kept hitting the soap dispenser when getting the loo paper but that was just me.  I wish the one at my hotel was like this."
4088,"We attended an event with about 10 people (two wheelchairs, one mobility scooter) plus PAs and we were very impressed with the welcoming attitude from the front of house staff at the theatre.   We felt like getting the red carpet treatment, the performance was delayed and we were kept updated about it, some space in the café allocated to us so that we can wait together.   Also, we got access to the auditorium before the rest of the audience, staff pointed out lifts and helped with guiding us through the crowd, putting the mobility scooter away etc."
4089,"Easy access into the restaurant, a bit cramped inside, and a very annoying situation with the accessible toilet. But nevertheless well worth a visit - lovely staff and fantastic food."
4090,Disabled toilet with plenty of space & grab rails.
4091,Staff are always friendly and helpful. There is a reception area available at all times for help/ advice
4092,"Geek Retreat has a few disabled parking spaces on the street, but for the most part cars must be parked in one of the many car parks around the city centre. Geek Retreat is very close to the bus station and several bus stops, and is reasonably near the train station. The pavement outside is flat, although a few paving stones do jut up slightly which could cause issues for the visually impaired. Geek Retreat is very close to the main shopping district in Leeds city centre."
4093,"Nice cafe in the lovely seaside town North Berwick. Just outside the cafe there is offstreet parking for Blue badge holders. Access is no problem for wheelchair users. There was a good variety of cakes on offer. I had scone and jam. Beverages, sandwiches and soup are also available. We chose to eat in but there is also an option to takeaway. There is a disabled toilet."
4094,"Pub 4 of the second day of my accessibility pub crawl in Broughty Ferry. Great spacious level access pub however, visited at a quiet time of the day."
4095,Staff were friendly and accommodating.
4096,"Wheelchair accessible, incredibly helpful staff, good disabled toilets, very inclusive"
4097,Very easy.
4098,Spacious and all on the level on the ground floor
4099,No real complaints about the toilets very spacious and all have grab-rails and reachable help cords.  
4100,"If you need a wheelchair accessible vehicle, speak to the concierge as one of the taxi firms specialises in this."
4101,"Plenty of places to park around the town centre and public transport avail, however it is on a pedestrianised street so no parking outside."
4102,"I can't describe it as our powerchair user didnt use it, but therewas one in the visitor centre I think and another in the cafe. Sporry can'r comment further - mnaybe someone else can add a comment about this?"
4103,I drove to the beach car park on Beach Road. It’s a Pay and Display Car park although you can pay by card ( instructions on the Pay and Display machine). The car park is large and mainly hard standing. There are a very limited number of Blue Badge spaces but if you don’t need one of those there was ample room to park early on in the day.
4104,Waterside is run by paid staff & volunteers. They were all very kind & helpful.
4105,"The lady who helped me with the lift was friendly, proactive and helpful. Five stars for her. But for the team as a whole, just two stars: for failing to consider accessibility within the shop, for using the lift as an ad-hoc store-room, for failing to maintain the lift in good working order, and for failing to maintain the required spring on the downstairs lift door. Disappointing. "
4106,The 1 staff member who tried to assist me was very nice and helpful.
4107,"There is one Blue Badge space on a 'first come, first served' basis which was always taken when we were there. You can pre book a space for £5 per night which is in the same small car park so isn't any further away. Rear access from the car park with a ramp and an intercom for opening the door."
4108,Ignore the steps on the corner! Go to the main entrance where there is an automatic door. Head through the next doors to the reception. There is then a platform lift to the main bar and a spacious lift to all the other floors with funky decor! Plenty of space to move around and good sized doors.
4109,"Well thought out. Not posh but included red cord correctly set, coat hook on door, sanitary bin at narrow side of toilet leaving wide side clear for right to left side transfer. No spring on door and rail on door to assist opening and closing. "
4110,"The entrance and exit had automatic doors which makes it easily accessible. There were signs all throughout the store and can be seen due to its large print. Most of the products are downstairs, only the furniture and a small coffee shop are situated on the first floor but these can be accessed using the wheelchair friendly escalator or the lift. There is also plenty of room between aisles to move around."
4111,"Terrible. Really bad attitude. Could not be bothered accomodating anyone with additional needs. Tutted, sighed, rolled eyes, slammed cutlery down, whipped menus out of our hands."
4112,"Kept pretty clean and the toilet itself is reasonably high.  A wheelchair could just about fit in the space available but it would be tight.  Additionally, the pull-down rail is in front of rather than at the side of the toilet. "
4113,Cabin have a full wet room with shower and rails. 
4114,"3 disabled spaces at front door, one across the road and several at top carpark. Buses also stop at front door."
4115,"Other than the person at the desk, we had no interaction with staff members, although there were some going about.  Also talks were given at various times during the day."
4116,We traveled to the dolphin spirt via a car. There maybe was a disabled car parking space but we couldn't see as most car parking spaces were full. 
4117,Access in was on the level and through doors that were open. Once inside staff were quick to move tables to accommodate the wheelchair users in the group.
4118,"All staff helpful and friendly. They showed us different types of accessible rooms for future visits. They made a fuss of older lady in party who was celebrating her birthday, which was much appreciated."
4119,"Accessible toilet in reception area, modern,clean and fresh, plenty of grab rails, plenty of room for turning with wheelchair, lightweight sliding door, emergency assistance cord in place. However signposting could be clearer, sign is quite high up and is intergrated into wooden decor.  "
4120,All very helpful and knowledgeable about the site.
4121,TFL are introducing new tube trains which increases access. Kew is now a station that doesn't need ramps with the new tubes on the District Line if you are a wheelchair user. However info on this online and with staff is erratic and confusing. Also get off east bound if going to Kew Gardens.
4122,"The staff couldn't be friendlier. They are found working in the cafes, shops and offices, or out working on the ground. Everyone I encountered was happy to offer assistance."
4123,When I visited the staff were very friendly and helpful.
4124,A great experience where spontaneously arriving and being two powerchair users was irrelevant. Great service and lovely food.
4125,There was an accessible toilet off the concourse which was accessed via a RADAR key. It was easy to get in to but a little tight on turning space once you are in.
4126,Ramp to the deck and lift to other floors. There are some spaces which are not accessible.
4127,"The pub is fully accessible via ramped front entrance. Only slight issue is heavy doors  if you're unaccompanied. Once inside floors are level and smooth, with plenty of manoeuvre space.  Staff are friendly and helpful. Highly recommended."
4128,"Can't comment on the parking. The museum is about 15 minutes' wheel/ walk from Amsterdam Centraal Station (mainline rail, underground and tram hub) and about five minutes' wheel/walk from the Dam - the big square in the centre of the city. There is a team stop quite close to the museum but we did not use it, so can't comment. Not all Amsterdam trams are wheelchair accessible. Cobbles, tram lines, the absence of drop downs, inconsiderately parked bikes and vehicles mean that Amsterdam isn't the most wheelchair-friendly city but we encountered no insupetable obstacles as we wheeled/walked."
4129,"Lift between floors; special chair for access into pool (see full review).  I didn't pay much attention to the braille etc because that's not where my need are, so I wouldn't want to say either way."
4130,"Staff here are very lovely and always ask me if I need help. They're very patient at the tills with me packing my bag, taking payments and so on."
4131,All polite and helpful.
4132,"A narrow entrance opens out into the main seating/cafe area - all level access and easily negotiated. (Street door though is a bit awkward, including slope leading up to it.)"
4133,"The toilet is almost as big as my bedroom!  Plenty space to manoeuvre, toilet is a good height and has plenty handrails (red cord is down to the floor).  Shower has a flip down seat and lowered shower head.  Only thing that lets it down is lack of changing table and hoist."
4134,"Parking  is at back of venue, no reserved disabled place. Entrance ramped slight sharp turn to left at top, your ok if you've got able with you double doors to contend with, greeted by stag, as reservation made, all friendly, leg heights differ from table to table, good service, toilet not visited, efficiency from staff throughout service, food very good. Nice walk following along waterfront."
4135,Room 4 is an accesible room with accessible toilet with grab rails and is slighly raised.
4136,"Lovely friendly staff who bend over backwards to be helpful, and are happy to chat at length about all canal matters."
4137,There is a regular toilet but it is down a twisty set of stairs with a handrail. This is also the stairs the waiting staff use.
4138,The disabled toilets are near the entrance and are very spacious.
4139,"If you are early enough there are many disabled places for parking , not the biggest spaces but not bad, public transport is out of my remit I am afraid "
4140,There is ramp access to the property with rest places in the car park for those who have trouble walking. 
4141,"A lovely fish and chip restaurant / takeaway with good wheelchair access and helpful, friendly  staff."
4142,Accessible toilet and shower 
4143,There is a accessible toilet in the Market Hall that's next door to the conventional loos. It's tucked away so it's best to go into the middle of the hall and look back toward the market and you will see it on the right. It's a long and narrow layout so for some wheelchair users it may well mean wheeling in and reversing out. It's well provisioned and modern and clean.
4144,"Some slopes as well as some level access points, but nothing major to worry about."
4145,"Fully accessible, plenty of room and clean"
4146,"Excellent staff. Can't fault them. They all seem happy and make a point to say hello in passing. They were extremely helpful across the board.  They never made us aware of the wheelchair as an inconvenience. You don't have to ask for help, there are plenty of staff and they appear out of nowhere when you need help! I've been for two years running and both years have been the same. I've never met staff quite like it."
4147,Mostly flat some hills but fine for mobility scooter users. Lots of disabled toilets around.
4148,"The doorway and threshold are a little awkward, but it's not too bad "
4149,The Kelpies made for a great visit albeit a bit chilly as they're exposed to the elements sitting alongside the canal. They were easy to get to by car and you had a choice of parking. Getting up close and around was easy with good surfaces to wheel on.
4150,There is no parking on site for any vehicle. You can park on the double yellows outside (if blue badge holder) as there is enough room for pavement users to still get past. Most people park on the road opposite or on the main road opposite the Meeting House.
4151,There are no accessible parking areas nearby. The closest is in the railway car park which is about 200m. Train and bus stops are very close.
4152,"A well deserved five stars as this is one of many visits I have made. From wheeling in through to seating, ordering and having your meal the experience was good. More so when you understand that my visits have included two or more wheelchair users each time."
4153,"This is a family butcher in Leven Street, Edinburgh - near the Kings Theatre and Bruntsfield Links. The shop is on the one level albeit with a small step at the entrance. All their pies, haggis, puddings, sausages, and other preparations are made on the premises. The glass fronted cabinets are well laid out with signage the contents of each tray, they have a freezer section, take orders by phone and e mail and have a delivery service. In addition to meats, poultry and game there are various baking, biscuit, jams and chutneys available, there is an informative website also available. Their produce is all local and there are always more than enough helpful and friendly staff available which denotes the popularity, turnover and sales of the produce on offer."
4154,large pavement to door of restaurant but level accesss exceptt for small bump at the threshold of main door. Tables widely spaced for such small restaurant. All on the level..
4155,Staff were very friendly and helpful. The barman quickly came from out of  behind the bar to assist when I struggled a bit with the doors to the toilets and moved chairs to help me get to the table.
4156,"There is a car park on-site but it wasn't clear where the disabled parking was so we had to pay for the parking, which seemed a bit expensive."
4157,Staff where friendly and helpful.
4158,"Rail by toilet, risers available"
4159,Due to Covid restrictions we did not meet staff but when contacting staff all were friendly and helpful. Nothing appeared to be a problem to them.
4160,"On street parking round the corner, it's a red route just outside. There is a big Tesco car park just down the road."
4161,The staff were  very friendly (despite lack of english) & they couldn't have been more helpful nothing was too much trouble!  
4162,"Was pleasantly surprised by how accessible this food venue was! Yes, it can get very busy which makes access a little trickier for everyone, but the fundamentals were there: step-free access, accessible loo, well-lit environment, movable benches at low tables, and very friendly staff."
4163,"Many foreign but friendly helpful staff, making sure they can support you."
4164,There was one wheelchair toilet available it was however difficult to find not good signage it is near the reception area. There is a large square area being used to display booklets about the hotel just off the reception area and the wheelchair toilet is in this area.  There is a grip rail on the left hand side as you it on the toilet and there is room for a care giver to help if required   
4165,"Very friendly and helpful.  Carried bags, shown to rooms.  Helped pick out dairy free items in restaurant.  They were great!"
4166,Wheelchair accessible throughout including the kids show  Allowed with MANUAL wheelchair on the boats
4167,Good overall 
4168,"This place only has three rooms, but they are in a beautiful old brick mill building with nice kitchens. The bathrooms are pretty tight, and there are several stairs are present to access the rooms. I found the staff highly accommodating however and they helped to fashion ramps. they also own the adjacent Chill n Grill which had great music and good food. The pool is very pretty."
4169,As above
4170,Staff are friendly and will always greet you on your way in and way out. Receptionists are chatty and pleasant.
4171,"The toilets are roomy, clean and easy to access."
4172,Marvellous. 
4173,The car park is large but there are only two or three dedicated disabled slots. However we have always managed to find a suitable alternative if these are full.
4174,Plenty of off street parking with disabled bays. 
4175,A great activity if you're looking for something accessible in aberdeen! 
4176,Very friendly couple who have a good understanding of a wheelchair users needs.
4177,Bus stop very close by that a number of buses stop at. I believe there is parking underneath the Omni Centre but we didn't use it on this visit.
4178,"Roald Dahl is buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Peter and Paul in Great Missenden, where he lived. Visiting his grave was a very special visit.  While I appreciate that a cemetery needs to always be respected I am also mindful that Roald Dahl fans will also want to visit his grave, and it has very poor disabled access."
4179,Lots of parking and a space right outside the door.
4180,"Great signage, no steps, access to all shop and cafe and outside"
4181,"The staff were really friendly , pleasent and helpful."
4182,"Gare du Sud is Nice's former station. Originally built in 1892, it has been transformed into a food court. The former train shed provides an impressive interior with its high ceiling, cast iron and glass panels and decorated with plants, it makes an inviting place to dine. The 20 + stalls offer a wide choice of world cuisine from cakes and coffee to local niçois specialities, lobster, burgers, Tex Mex, Scandinavian Smørrebrød, Italian, Thai, Japanese street food, gelato, etc.  There is also a bar. It is self service. It's very accessible as it is step free and has an accessible toilet."
4183,You access at Heathrow terminal one for disabled users is very good because it's very spacious and they have very good signage for us to know where the lists at terminal one out very big as well see you could get three for possibly five or jazz analyst at once
4184,Only downside was heavy doors but staff were quick to help.
4185,"There are two dedecated parking spaces inusde th main gate, althouugh there is ample parking close by. A notice on thr gate invites visiters to sound their horn and a member of the team attends to them,all very welcoming"
4186,Good size well laid out
4187,There are two disabled toilets that I seen on board the ferry. Both are large and have everything that I needed. I also noticed an untangled red cord which was nice.
4188,"There are lots of accessible toilets in the building, there are many around the arena.  All that I saw were roomy enough to have a wheelchair and carer in, if required. Baby changing facilities were not sharing this space.  I noticed in several of them though, the emergency pull-cords were tucked in behind things, so could be out of reach if someone needed them. "
4189,Visited here for the first time today and thrilled with it being completely wheelchair accessible. As a para equestrian I struggle to find tack shops that are accessible so this ticked the box straight away. The staff were super helpful and kind. Will 100% visit again 
4190,There is no dedicated parking for Argos but there is parking at Intu with large accessible bays (not free) and limited street parking (free if have a blue badge).  There is a bus stop but it depends where you are coming from.   Nearest bus station is Derby Bus Station which is about 8 minutes away. Nearest railway station is around 12 minutes away. 
4191,The car park is right at the top.  The site has a visitor bus as it is big and the ramp was ready in 2 seconds and no fuss 
4192,"As said previously, on board, the access is good.  On the particular cruise I was on, there seemed very few excursions, if any, catering for the needs of wheelchair users. However, if you want to explore yourself, In most ports there are taxis sitting dockside waiting to pick up passengers, some were decent size for getting the wheelchair in the boot of the car if you are able to transfer into the passenger seat of the cab."
4193,"Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Life is built on the old Summerlee Ironworks situated in Coatbridge. The museum has both indoor and outdoor attractions as well as a canal and cafe, all which are accessible by wheelchair. The only thing found that was not accessible was the coal mine due to its cramped conditions. However the tram on site has a tail lift allowing wheelchair access to enjoy the short tram ride round to the cottages and the exhibition hall has a lift allowing access to the upper floor for temporary exhibits and the viewing pod. Overall the Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Life was very accommodating when it came to disabled access."
4194,"The Alhambra theatre is located in the city centre of Bradford. It has rail, road and bus access nearby.  The venue has level acess on Great Horton Street which is located at the side of the building.   There are 6 designated spaces for wheelchair users once inside the theatre, guide dogs are welcome inside the theatre. The designated wheelchair spaces are located in the middle of the auditorium. Companions sit beside the wheelchair user. During the performances audio described is avaliable along woth hearing loop system. Although the venue is wheelchair friendly the venue does not provide wheelchairs if one is needed.   There are accessible toilet's avaliable at the venue, these are unisex and do not require a key to open. The door is locked on a locking handle and the taps are a lever type. The toilets have a emergency alarm. Lighting levels in the toilets are bright. The mirrors in the toilet are at a low level promoting easy use.   "
4195,"The staff are very helpful. One day in particular I went to the bowling alley with a friend who has epilepsy some of the lights were flashing slightly. We informed staff of our difficulty, and the lights were turned off promptly."
4196,Great access - there is a lift that brings you up to the main section. This is where you find the giant memorial to Lincoln and the words of the Gettysburg address on the walls. From here you can also see the Washington monument at the other side of the Reflecting Pool.
4197,The venue is in a shopping centre and there is a car park there. I came by tube to Angel which is OK for me as a walking stick user as it has escalators. There are a number of buses stopping near the venue.
4198,We parked a little way away from Valerie’s as we wanted to enjoy the walk along the spotlessly clean prom so wasn’t aware of nearby parking.  There is no parking immediately next to Valerie’s .
4199,Read above.
4200,No parking at the venue. Public car parks up and down slopes needing a good wheelchair pusher. If you use a mobility scooter from the car park remember that you can’t use it inside the museum. Bus routes stop nearby (near Royal Bath Hotel) but again steep approach to the museum. You’d need to take a taxi from the railway station.
4201,"The café is located inside Russell Square Gardens. The entrances to the gardens are step free through wide wrought iron gates, which are left wide open when the park is open. Inside the gardens are level tarmaced paths. The nearest entrance to the café is the north east one, which is by the junction of Russell Square, Woburn Place and Bernard Street (which is the street that Russell Square tube station is on). From this entrance go down the path immediately in front of you and the café is on the left.  The entire café area is step free. It has a spacious outdoor seating area with free standing table and chairs. There are manual doors, which have always been open when I have visited (during the good weather). Once inside there is a long counter which is at standing height and the aisle beside it.  At the till area there is another door for customers to exit. Inside there is a spacious seating area with free standing table and chairs. The café has floor to ceiling windows. "
4202,No signage the disabled toilet. Entrance tricky due to ice cream cabinet position. No transfer place due to bin position. Red cord trails on floor.
4203,"On the ground floor, where restaurant and bar is there is an accessible toilet, which is labelled ""Disabled Toilet"". The toilet was spacious with grab rails but no emergency cord.  In my room there was a standard toilet with a grab handle."
4204,My team and I  were looking for accessible accommodation in the Kinross area and I stumbled across this gem of a place. It’s so lovely to stay in the same place as a team and the lodge has everything you could want and need. This really is luxury home from home. We all slept well and all curled well too. We enjoyed staying there so much as a team that we are returning again next month.  It’s such a great place and Shona is very helpful and able to accommodate most of your requests.  The stunning views from this wonderful location makes me want to come back when I’m not curling so I can enjoy just relaxing there and chilling out.  I’m a full time wheelchair user and the Lodge was very easy for me to get around.  It’s an all round great place to stay. 
4205,There are a couple of good accessible loos. On diff end floors which was handy.
4206,The access throughout this hotel was absolutely fantastic.
4207,"I only used the toilets beside the café and they were good but I accidently hit the red cord and staff came running in, ""hey guys?"". Nice and spacious toilets. "
4208,"Other than at the Disabled toilets, access to the walkway and beach were was good, although the latter were a bit spread out along the beach.  Where they were, the access was very good"
4209,"With step free access and an automatic door into the building, it's a wonderfully accessible building with lots of space once inside. The doorways are wide and some of the work spaces are lower, too. "
4210,"We asked for a disabled room, but was advised it did not have a view of the harbour and only a tub no shower. Other rooms with a view are not easy for wheelchairs as they are narrower doors, access to toilet was not very easy, the showers were cubicle, therefore I had sit on toilet and washed from the sink. I did ask for plastic chair for the shower, but none available."
4211,"No steps, level access (fine for wheelchair/mobility scooter) and lots of space (with plenty seats) inside."
4212,"There's a pretty pond, loos, parking and picnic area at this former quarry on the Wall.  A short but steep track takes you up to the Wall trail. There and back outing was about a mile and a quarter - you need a sturdy set of motorised wheels and help if you get stuck going up the hill (I did!). Worth the effort for views and ruins."
4213,"There is one step up from street level into the house and then all the guest house accommodation is on the same level. Many of the doors are double doors so they are wide and spacious. There are three bedrooms, each of which have a large en suit bathroom, with shower. I can only comment about the facilities in my room but my shower was an open cubicle with curtain and there was one step up to get into it. The floor of the shower cubicle was textured so it did not feel slippery. The accommodation is spacious and in the communal areas there is an open top courtyard with comfortable seating, dinning room and lounge for guests to use."
4214,"Absolutely fantastic. Very friendly, helpful and kind."
4215,"The second member of staff I spoke to was one of the people searching bags etc, unfortunately his opening line to me was about my walking being some kind of miracle and unfortunately I have zero sense of humour about this as a wheelchair user. Everyone else was awesome and even  he apologised when I spoke to him about his attitude and explained that it's not acceptable, I just don't think I should HAVE to educate staff when I go anywhere! "
4216,Won't be returning due to their fire safety policies for disabled customers. Segregation and worst seats. Rubbish.
4217,It is level when entering and moving around. No need for lift as all on one floor. We did not see any seating areas other than in courtyard for cafe.
4218,"Automatic doors , all on the one level Plenty of space to manoeuvre, plenty of seating available. Signage good, offer of disability assistance signposted at main entrance one way system to enter and exit clearly signposted Low level counter available Induction loop available Leaflets available with Braille, or audio tape. Option to communicate with BT text direct, or Sign Video for those with hearing difficulties Cash machine available at wheelchair level outside The bank is part of the Hidden Disability Sunflower Lanyard Scheme  "
4219,"After reviewing this excellent hotel in part one, we were delighted to find that they have tried hard to offer far more to their visitors in the way of entertainment during your visit here, and the present owner, Mr Rick Cressman has done well with his ambition for this lovely property. It is a 15 acre site, with the very attractive old Jacobean house as it focal point,  and has a very well laid out 9 hole par 3 golf course, while indoors you will find a very pleasant heated swimming pool, a small but well equipped gym, a facility area ideal for small wedding occasions with a lovely setting, while larger gatherings will be delighted with the large marque that will hold wedding parties and regular evening entertainment with various shows that you would enjoy.  OUR REVIEW Parking is easy enough, but only one disabled bay, but it’s not far to walk anyway.  The grounds outside have been landscaped in a natural way, with many tall old trees and shrubs to see, (photo 1) and passing Nailcote Halls Jacobean 17th century hall, an inviting path leads ahead (photo 2) towards the purpose built leisure centre (3). Entering, which is on the level, you enter a cheerful well decorated ground floor greeting area, (4) very clean and inviting, and the metal ironworks and staircase hold  promise of what’s to come (photo 5), and this room can be used for wedding day delights, or for small entertainments (6).  The disabled do not have to worry, as a small lift is available for you, just beyond the staircase (7) which is big enough to get you and your chair inside, along with your Carer (8). The room today has been set up for a wedding reception, in what is called Ricks  Bar, but Over in the right hand corner (photo 9) the door will lead to a very nice Roman bath style heated swimming pool, (10) with a bubbling jacuzzi that looks so inviting (11) and a steam room is available for your use. You will also find a small but well equipped modern gym that awaits your attention (12). The entertainment facilities here are very popular and booking is important, but it is a very nice building, well lit and has natural lighting provided by its glass roofed ceiling (13). The main path will now lead you pass the grounds (14) and the up to date converted and restored brick work of the upper bedrooms (15) towards the nine hole par 3 golf course (16) and beyond this you will reach a delightful summer outdoor seating area (17). At one time, part of the grounds held a croquet lawn, and Pétanque area, which is an interesting game that disabled could enjoy as well. HOW YOU WOULD HAVE PLAYED. It’s a type of boules game, but with this game you toss the ball into the air rather than roll it, to try to get as near as possible to a jack, BUT the ball must not touch the jack, or you loss that round. So this is ideal for disabled, as no steps are taken, you can remain in your chair while you toss your ball, and these are smaller than normal boules so are easier to grasp. Sadly it is no longer used here for these two games anymore.  The grounds with its own small pool (18) has an entrance (but mind you, with steps to get you up into the marque ). The disabled will of course have to enjoy arriving into this huge marque, from inside the hotel and the specially built entrance (19) but what a treat greets you (20) and it’s here that the large entertainment shows are held, as well as wedding day treats. Most of the regularly held shows will include a three course meal and a late night show, usually finishing by 1.00 am. Details can be found on the hotels website.  So you will gather it’s a popular hotel nowadays, and to see it at its best do please read our part one review, for we are sure you will enjoy your visit just as much as we did.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS. We really do recommend this hotel to our disabled friends, and our review of the hotel itself will show you why, but this review of what you can do and expect on a visit here should encourage you to come and see for yourselves, they really do try to please, the shows that are provided are very good, the food is well recommended, it’s quite easy enough to get around both indoors and out there when the sun is out to play, and most of all, you will be well looked after by the staff members, and they will make sure you enjoy your visit, do come and play .   "
4220,"There are plenty of lifts and they are all of the larger type so it's easy to wheel in with a powerchair and turn around if you want to. The lifts have audio announcements and buttons are clear and at wheelchair height. For the summer there is the added surprise of a roof garden with a coffee shop. Wheelchair access is via a different route. Staff on the main garden entrance arranged for a member of staff to take me via a dedicated route and lift to the gardens. Once in the garden it's easy to wheel around on the artificial grass, see the magnificent views of London and relax with a smoothie."
4221,"Very good shows on including some by disability theatre company lung ha. good parking & bus routes, lift and toilets available, friendly staff, good cafe."
4222,Staff very much what you expect from this pub chain.
4223,"Parking is difficult at Woodstock, but you get the best photos of Blenheim Palace along Park street. Just ask permission at the gate to be allowed to step inside to take a photo. Then drive round to Blenheim Palace main entrance for parking to visit the palace itself. Bladon, and burial place of sir Winston Churchill is a most  difficult place to park, just a few spaces on roadside if fortunate. But most visitors to the church are in and out quiet quickly, so you may be ok."
4224,Nearest accessible Tube station was Westminster - about fifteen minutes on foot.  Buses abound and presume could be taken to the venue as it's located in Victoria. Didn't see any Blue Badge parking nearby.
4225,"Across the road you can park at the St David's Centre which has a great changing places toilet. Plenty of parking spaces,  but you pay full place and its up three floors. There is often a long wait for the lifts. Don't go if you suffer from vertigo as you have to corkscrew round and round for ages to get to the first(3rd) parking floor."
4226,"No parking as such but plenty of space for loading (as with us, and our minibus) and drop off zones (for taxis)."
4227,"This was the first time I'd attended a very large gathering post-pandemic; it was being held outdoors and having been before, I knew that we could distance socially and still have a great experience.  You can bring picnics and seats and I've even seen a dinner table one time.  Van Morrison was brilliant!  I've seen him here before and he was ok then but not very interactive with the audience, however, this time he was much more engaging and even played 'Madame George' for the first time in years!  His band were also amazing and as it was the 25th anniversary of The Extravaganza, the fireworks at the end were even more spectacular if that's possible, especially against the stunning background of the Abbey, which was also lit up for the occasion.  "
4228,For a ruin the access is remarkably good. You're able to get around most of the building to get great views and enjoy the sensation of the sunshine peering between the pillars and towers. 
4229,"Savignypl. 11, 10623 Berlin, Germany,  There are  about 10 restaurants in this lovely little square, after visiting them all to try and get dinner, I found this was the only one with a disable toilet. It is a great busy place about a miles walk (or wheel) from the zoo, great to eat out of an evening and they do great Vietnamese food"
4230,A great rail service and helpful friendly assistance staff. A really handy station for changing to the DLR and for visiting the Westfield Centre.
4231,Spacious car park gave easy access .  No dedicated disabled space although probably not an issue Not sure there is any public transport  to this small village in the heart of Monmouthshire!
4232,Only the very low 'step' in front of each lift.
4233,We drove to the Distillery from St Andrews and it was a fairly quick run. The distillery nestles deep in the estate and a long scenic drive meanders its way to the car park. Two prominent accessible parking bay signs depict the parking spaces. Only a 50 metre walk from there along the hard surfaces pathway and you are in the visitor centre. 
4234,Plenty of disabled parking. As far as I am aware - there is no public transport to the site.There is parking for coaches as well as cars.
4235,Great! Very friendly and even though it's self service they will bring food to your table.
4236,There are 2 just before the entrance to the screens. One has baby change in it (lhs) and is larger.  Oddly the one of the Right hand side which is smaller and isn't a baby change  has a nappy bin in it beside the loo which prevents a wheelchair user from being able to transfer. A very nice member of staff said she'd look into this.
4237,None
4238,uneven grounds and muddy entrances
4239,Cameron is ambulance but severe learning difficulties so  not the widest access patsy the cosmetics but not bad. A large chair would be perhaps an issue though
4240,It's farmers field and to get pumpkins you need get on field but we managed with my son manual chair if someone helped him push.
4241,Friendly and welcoming.
4242,"Friendly and helpful enough - with programmes, tickets etc.  However I did appreciate the staff help with the heavy internal doors."
4243,"Four star water front hotel opposite Torquay railway station.  Overall in the communal areas there is very good accessibility ramps, accessible public spaces and accessible toilet on ground floor, 2 lifts. The hotel has 132 rooms and their website states ""The Grand has one bedroom with fully-equipped wet room, fitted with grab rails around the bathroom and it is situated on the ground floor.  A shower stool can be provided for use in this room."""
4244,The beach control wardens that patrol the seafront are always polite whenever I've booked the beach wheelchair or asked for any assistance or wanted to know something. 
4245,when visiting the car park states that it is full but when you look around there are a few disabled parking spots available but the car park won't let you in
4246,"The accessible toilets are hidden slightly and were a little difficult to find. This could be because it was such a busy event, so it may well be easier to find when the venue is quieter.   The looks themselves were quite tight and cramped. Far from the spacious changing places loos."
4247,Staff are incredibly friendly and will come and check on you whenever you visit.
4248,Friendly and helpful staff particularly in the cafe area.
4249,The staff are very helpful and incredibly friendly. They were happy to assist with any questions about access or about any of the exhibits.
4250,"There are quite heavy iron gates into the park, which are usually already open. One of the gates was padlocked, unfortunately this was the nearest one to the bus stop, so I had to walk further to the next entrance. On the narrower sides of the park is on a noticable but not steep slope. However length wise the paths are mostly flat. There are gravel paths which were slightly hard work with my crutch but wouldn't put me off visiting again. There are different types of benching including some with arms at the ends. At the opposite end of the park from Pentonville Road there is a children's play park, which I didn't visit."
4251,"This is a church for all ages. It’s a good place to find out more about the Christian faith and how it connects with daily life. I attend this church every week, either online or in person.  Eventbrite booking via website. Ramped access. Handrail at steps. Hearing loop. Amplification. Service streamed live on YouTube. Accessible fonts on display screen. Clear signage. Disabled toilet. Removable seats to provide wheelchair spaces. A person dedicated to ensuring accessibility and inclusion for all."
4252,Brilliant. Very keen to make my visit possible.
4253,"The wheelchair seating in this cinema is at a really good height/level. It is not right at the front of the screen (IMAX screen 13 is especially good) so you can avoid neck pain trying to watch a film. Also good for those with limited neck movement. We have never had a problem when using a CEA card for carers admission.  The access from the screen door entrance up the slope into the seating area can be a little  tricky, especially if I have arms full of hotdogs and my husband needs an extra push up the slope, however staff are happy to help."
4254,"Wheelchair accessible although a slight lip at main entrance, but staff happy to help. Plenty of room for wheelchair at table. Staff very friendly and helpful. Lunch delicious , special offers on at lunchtime. Tasty well cooked food. Toilets inaccessible for wheelchair user, no accessible toilet on premises"
4255,The site is just off the M1 at junction 29A. It was easy to find and no narrow entrances or anything. All very easy. The arrivals parking area is right outside reception and is completely flat. The roads around the site are all good quality asphalt. Pitches are mostly gravel.
4256,Bang opposite the station and next to the bus stops so we were very happy. The bus stop we came in on was one of the accessible style where the pavement was raised so no having to deploy ramps which was a bonus!
4257,Everyone was helpful without being asked to be so. We felt very welcome
4258,Staff were OK - polite & seemed efficient.
4259,Following day after my sons stag do we had brunch here - staff very friendly and service excellent. An external lift from street level takes you up to the pub
4260,"Accessible disabled toilet, all the usual- handrails, pull cord, higher seat, low sink ect."
4261,The Box Office is easy to reach with low level counters which make it simple to interact with staff.  Screens are accessible via ramp. Inside the the screens wheelchair spaces are far enough from the front to provide a good view with plenty of space to move around.. Carers/Personal Assistants receive a free ticket and audio description is available in most 2d showings. 
4262,Good size of restaurant to manoeuvre around.
4263,"Couldn't do enough - particularly the head waiter.  Very helpful - with moving chairs etc.  Assistance offered with menus, and the service was speedy.  Clearing of plates too was fast and unobtrusive."
4264,"The bathroom in the apartment worked for me. There was a shower which you needed to step over the runner of the shower door to get in, see photo. I brought my own non slip bath mat, but I found it quite hard to get it to stick to the tiles, as I couldn't bend over and stick it down, so I ended up with my flip flops on in the shower and that was fine for me. There was a regular toilet but it was between the washing machine worktop and the door so I had something to grab onto both sides to help me with my transfers. "
4265,"Parking next to the corn exchange, but often gets quite busy. It's a dirt car park so gets muddy and may not be good for wheelchairs.  This is in town and next to the bus station so easy transport links. "
4266,The story is fully accessible with step free access and the lift to all levels.
4267,Only visited the café which is joint on to the museum about the RRS Discovery ship and centers around Captain Scott's voyage to the Antarctic. You can climb aboard this marvellous ship that was built in Dundee in 1901 and returned in 1986. It has been permanently situated where it stands today since 1993. 
4268,"Disabled parking available at about 300 yards, closest bus stop is 800 yards away. Level access from car park and bus stop to the venue. "
4269,"Plenty of space by the tables but not all seating is suitable. There is a long ramp up to the bar and also handrails on the steps inside. A nice venue, a good menu, but spoilt by dirty glassware."
4270,Several disabled parking spaces located next to the promenade with easy access from car park to promenade.
4271,"The cathedral is very open planned and is spacious all the way around for sufficient mobility requirements and will facilitate people to see all sides of it. Their are access ramps located at both entrances, one at either end of the cathedral.  "
4272,It was superb. We rocked up and bought our tickets (carer goes free) and then treated ourselves to an essential ice cream! Staff had told us where to go so we headed up in the spacious lift. It helps to have someone with you as when you exit the lift there are a few heavy doors until you get to the auditorium. Accessible seats and wheelchair spaces are in the back row so very easy to access. It also means that you have a great sightline and no tilting heads skywards! Everything is well signposted. Also saw evacuation chairs displayed too.
4273,it is easy to find the toilets and you have plenty of room to move around.
4274,"I didn’t use the loo in the main hotel, my partner looked at it and  said it was ‘OK’."
4275,"Always friendly and welcoming, especially if you are new. "
4276,"The Meadows Festival is a volunteer-run music and community festival that happens in June in the Meadows park in Edinburgh. The park is lined with food stalls, charity stands and thrift shop/car boot tables to browse plus a funfair. Most of the festival is grassy, but the grass is kept short and is great to sit on when the weather is dry. I particularly enjoyed the dog show this year! Access is quite good in the Meadows, however a few of the food stalls are in vans which have very high counters. If the weather was bad and the grass was quite wet, it might become trickier to cross some of the grassier parts of the Meadows."
4277,"Lots of options! On arriving at Barcelona, we used the Aerobus, but on the way back we used the Metro which was far simpler and the airport line is modern and generally more accessible than some other lines. There are also lots of taxis, train and regular busses to choose from. It's not too expensive to get to the city centre, no matter which way you travel."
4278,The staff are very friendly and welcoming. 
4279,"“A FARM SHOP, JUST OUTSIDE ST ANDREWS, IN THE BEAUTIFUL KINGDOM OF FIFE.” We have been traveling up and down to St Andrews from Edinburgh for years and have only just found this hidden gem.  Unfortunately when we arrived the cafe was closing but we did manage to look around the farm shop and flower shop. We decided to explore St Andrews before coming back to the steak barn for delicious dinner. Tables at the barn cannot be reserved it works on a first come first served basis. The menu consist of a variety of steaks, sausages, burgers and chicken with a large choice of side dishes. We decided to share several different things from the menu. It was delicious. Definitely recommend it.  I would like to mention that the car park surface is gravel and so pushing a wheelchair on it is not easy. Also as far as I could tell there  are no disabled toilets unless there are ones in the cafe."
4280,Merseyrail. Central Station.  Lift from platforms always busy and you have to queue. Staff really friendly and helpful
4281,"There is a fully accessible bathroom located on the main floor of the restaurant. This was a spacious, clean and well sign posted. The helpful staff are available to provide directions to the bathroom if you miss the sign postings."
4282,We were travelling on foot - it's a short distance from Euston and King's Cross stations - with plenty of train and bus links.
4283,"The Crick is step free and is accessible. There is a concourse in front of the building and the public entrance is on the right hand side. I found the entrance to the building a little confusing due to poor signage. Looking directly onto the front of the building there are stairs and a ramp on the left hand side and it's difficult to know if that's the entrance or not until you go over to the foot of the stairs and read the sign, which directs you to the right hand side. At the public entrance there are 2 revolving doors and I entered through these doors and walking with a crutch I found that the doors turned a little to fast for me. There is third door, to the right of the revolving doors, which doesn't have a handle, but in front of there is a post with an intercom at wheelchair accessible height, which you'd use to gain entry. Once inside there's is a desk at wheelchair accessible height and some sofas.  We were attending an event, film show, in the  auditorium which is to the right of the main reception area and is step free. The auditorium has two entrances. The one closest to reception is step free and only the first row of chairs are at step free level. There is another entrance at the back of the auditorium which is accessed via a platform lift and which on the website says that dedicated spaces for wheelchairs are available at the back of the auditorium.  Most of the seating is via a staircase with a single handrail. On my visit I didn't see their exhibition space so unable to comment about this.  Their website says that there are an induction loops in reception,  auditorium and meeting rooms. All guide dogs for the hearing and sight impaired are allowed in the ground-floor communal areas and in the collaboration areas on each floor.  There is also a coffee shop which is step free."
4284,The venue is a good way out of the city centre so we used a Taxi to and from the venue. there is a mini bus that goes from the city centre to Strawberry fields about once an hour each way the mini bus is does not have a wheelchair lift. the  Web site  www.strawberryfieldliverpool.com gives you details about bus times and the hours the exhibition is open There is a large car park however they have as yet not marked out any Blue Badge Spaces hopefully they will do this soon
4285,Browns is a lovely restaurant and bar situated by The Green in Angel. The food and cocktails are really tasty but can be a little pricey. Access is top-notch and the atmosphere is very relaxed so you often don't mind paying that little bit more for comfort.
4286,"Outstanding accessibility, outstanding staff, outstanding food - top marks!"
4287,"dedicated parking right outside the front door, all level no kerbs etc"
4288,"a dream. I went to see 5 seconds of summer and I had a really great view where they put me, although the barrier was a little high for me, although I am quite small in my wheelchair. Second time round I went to see tonight alive and the staff constructed a ramp for me to go on and therefore being above the barrier. Solving the problem I had the first time. Also the career ticket was a doddle, just a quick email to the disabled access requirements and it was solved. They do state though that it is first come first served, so if it's likely to be busy don't leave it to the last minute."
4289,Level access 
4290,"We had a lovely visit to this cafe and shop. It has a relaxed vibe and good music, spacious room with vegan and gluten free foods, lovely tea and a great atmosphere. Accessibility was good and adaptions have been made"
4291,"B + B Edinburgh is a boutique bed and breakfast hotel in the New Town area of the city. It has twenty-seven rooms and two have been equipped to provide disabled access. Unfortunately, my visit stopped at the front door as there is no wheelchair access to the building at present."
4292,All the security staff that we met were helpful.
4293,There was an easy to access accessible toilet. It was clean and tidy and had sufficient space for me to manoeuvre. It might be a little tight for some larger power chair users.
4294,"A lot of hoses on the paths. For a wheelchair user, they look like yellow snakes that require some navigation. A wheelchair user will require a carer.   The noise from overhead aircrafts is simply overwhelming. The noise is relentless and jarring.   "
4295,"Small M&S on two levels. reasonably accessible ,lovely big cafe on site, staff were exceptionally helpful, but because it is a small store , displays are crammed quite close together making navigation around the store difficult at times. no facilities at till to assist accessibility , you have to join a queue in an enclosed lane which is narrow to exit, and there appears to be no facilities for those visually impaired or hard of hearing"
4296,Fantastic  very Friendly very  accommodating . Thy helped me a lot with my food purchase 
4297,"Tickets for the golf course can be bought at the food van next to the entrance of the golf course. The counter is at standing height. I was give a club, ball, score card and pencil. This is a mini golf course so there are short distances between the different holes. The golf course has level access but some of the holes have a slope of other obsticles to make the course more harder to navigate. The member of staff told me to leave the flag in the hole when I am playing the shot, as at the end when the ball goes in the hole I can pull the flag and it will also lift the ball, and this saved me bending down to take the ball out of the hole. When I visited there 1 of the 12 holes was missing its flag, but I asked someone else to take the ball out of the hole for me. There was a bench about half way round. It is a relatively easy course to navigate and was very doable with my crutch."
4298,Flat step free entrance and access only to the Club Room and Bar Area
4299,Great access to this cinema. All screens have wheelchair spaces at the front and 3 screens also have wheelchair spaces at the back. These are accessed  by a lift - show a member of staff your tickets and they'll take you up in the lift. 
4300,"not nearly enough disabled parking access, have to constantly vie for space with taxis and coaches"
4301,Parking was ok but on gravel 
4302,There are no step-free stations nearby. Zillions of buses go up and down nearby Oxford Street. I wouldn't dream of trying to park in this area.
4303,"We popped in to explore what Stack Newcastle had to offer today. Described as ""A CREATIVE SOCIAL HUB FOR ENTERTAINMENT, CULTURE, WORK AND PLAY. A DESTINATION CONCEPT IN THE HEART OF NEWCASTLE CITY CENTRE"" on its website,  this venue is created out of  what look like shipping containers creating space for a multitude of small businesses that range from take aways and restaurants, coffee shops and bars to small shops selling ranges including local photographs, ethical clothing, vegan pet products, jewellry, a florist and a barbers.  Places to eat  offer a great variety including Sushi, Lebanese bake, Texas grill, pizza, fish and chips, crepes, vegan , Korean food, cheesecakes and tacos, so you are spoilt for choice. There are a few bars offering specialties that include Gins, craft beers and cocktails mostly situated around an open central seating area on benches that surround a pit fire. As this is outdoors with a covered area above, there are numerous heaters to keep the chill off.  We visited on a Friday lunch time and everything was open but fairly quiet. It was fully accessible to mobility scooters and wheelchairs, although in some areas space is limited where you need to turn around or back up.  There is an accessible lift to the upper floor and a disabled toilet upstairs which appeared to be clean with plenty of room to manoeuvre.  Staff were very helpful, opening the lift door and offering assistance without even being approached, explaining how the lift works etc. Security staff offered to show me around."
4304,"This church has a level entrance on Battersea Rise, and a lift at the Boutflower Road entrance. The button for the automatic door on Boutflower Road doesn't work, but the receptionist will let you in if you get their attention via the buzzer. There are steps up to the main hall, or a lift through the door on your right. You may need help to manage the fire door and lift door as they are close together. The lift will get you to all levels of the hall. There is an accessible toilet. The doors from the hall to the church are generally propped open when a service or event is happening. There is one room in the organ loft which is not accessible by wheelchair, which is mainly used for youth groups. There is a separate level-access entrance to the crypt from outside - you will need to let someone know to open it for you, as most people will use the stairs inside."
4305,"Accessible loos in reception and in our room, properly designed and easy to use."
4306,"I was blown away by helpful the staff were. The head barista on today was knowledgable, helpful and a lovely warm friendly person.This extended to the other members of staff on. "
4307,"I use these facilities a fair bit, when shopping, and every visit the cord has either been broken or tied up. So now I have the cards, I've placed one there!! Apart from cord I can get in easy enough either manual or electric wheelchair, have also managed to get small scooter in there! "
4308,The owner visited us on the day we arrived and before we left. We also knew that we could contact them if we needed anything.
4309,"We had a room in the new part. We could choose to have it made up as a double or twin, with or without bed risers. Wet room,  space in bed and bathroom for a hoist."
4310,There were lots of lifts and room to move. It is also easy to reach the clothes but some are harder.
4311,"We arrived via taxi, though the car park is just a stone's throw away.  No idea about public transport."
4312,Most were extremely kind and helpful.
4313,Plenty of disabled spaces and can drop off at door too x
4314,Has loo's but was very difficult to get into not very clean at all and worst off no bog roll
4315,"The houses can be reached by metro, taxi, or car.  Accessible parking is available in the nearby Markthal.  They are also a 25 minute walk from the Amsterdam Centraal train station."
4316,Fantastic access through and the staff were just as impressive.
4317,Very nice and friendly and very proud of their wheelchair accessibility!
4318,There is a large accessible toilet but getting to it and back to your seat is difficult.
4319,"Dad and I were getting peckish driving back to Lerwick, seen this little gem at the side of the road and thought we'd investigate.   As it's a farm shop and cafe, all the dishes are incredibly fresh and yummy.  Their menu isn't huge but if definitely offers something for everyone, soups, sandwiches/toasties, baked potatoes, quiches, homemade burgers and a couple of specials. Dad opted for the curry special and I decided upon a brie and onion chutney toastie, plus tea for two.  Didn't take long to arrive and was awesome, dad's curry looked enough for two and my toastie was oozing with filling. No little tea cups here, oh no a proper mug each and enough tea to fill them twice over.  The staff were lovely, the older lady in front of me was deaf and so struggling to understand what they were saying, her daughter was helping but it still took 3 attempts.  The young girl serving didn't rush her or look annoyed at all.  Tables are a little close together but there's a couple nearer the serving area that would be perfect for a wheelchair user.  Toilet was fab, spacious and clean, great layout.  The view out to the ocean and all the sea birds make it perfect. Good to see lots of local using it - shows it must be good. "
4320,"Easy to move wheelchair around tables and chairs. Access by going into Tesco supermarket. Disabled toilet next door out the café in the supermarket. Different choices of seating. Soya milk available. Some free from foods available. Variety of hot and cold food, sweet treat and drinks. Enjoy eating/drinking in there. Staff happy to check allergy/ingredients book. Usually not too busy. Often get a take-away coffee to take round the supermarket as I do my shopping. Downside is they now only do paper starts which is a bit incompatible with hot drink (I need straws as I can't lift cups). Serving counter is quite high if you're in a wheelchair but staff are happy to help, e.g. pass you the card machine or fetch something out of the chilled cabinet."
4321,Automatic doors lead inside where it level access.  However heavy internal doors leading to gym & pool areas may cause problems.  The pool changing area is quite narrow and the disabled changing room is at the rear.
4322,Staff were friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu. They were also quite accommodating with respect to moving tables and chairs when needed.
4323,"Not to bad, most of hotel is level, but there are steps preventing you from seeing all you would like, and a rather steep ramp to get up to enter the beautiful restaurant itself if having dinner here later on in the evening, just have a strong carer with you to get you up this ramp, preferably dragging you up backwards for safety. Our photos show some of these steps and the ramp, do take a look.  The only lift we found was in the Woodland Court annex of hotel were we got lost,  and although a small lift we did both manage to get in, and get ourselves even more lost."
4324,next door to underground station and close to bus stops; next to multi-storey car park and small on road parking area
4325,"As already described. Although I only saw 2 disabled  bays outside main entrance and a few further down the car park, there seemed ample parking. "
4326,There is one accessible toilet in the shop. It is right in the corner and some Roman shields had to be moved to let me in. The doorway was too narrow for my trike but was fine for my normal chair. It was clean. It had a RADAR lock but mostly was left open and staff used it (e.g. cafe staff). 
4327,There is a loo but it is very dated and wouldn't fit most power chairs.  The door is a slide door that doesn’t offer much privacy and there is no mirror.  Getting into the toilet involves some tight manoeuvres. 
4328,"There is some on street parking on West Nicolson Street and the surrounding streets but it can be quite busy. There are bus stops nearby on Nicolson Street, this is a main bus route with the 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 14, 29, 30, 31, 33, 37, 47 and 49 all stopping on it. The 41 and 42 buses go along Chapel Street. "
4329,"The accessible loo was OK. Bit small and tight to manoeuvre, but clean, and the rails were OK for me. From what I could tell, I think this is the only loo in the museum, so the drawback was that there was a queue of people outside when I came out - many with babies in pushchairs. There is a council toilet block nearby on the waterfront, though, so maybe that would have been OK instead."
4330,"Staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful, and with a good level of disability awareness."
4331,Staff generally nice just need more training and understanding on hidden disability's.  
4332,"This is a Luxury 5 star Gold Holiday Cottage and  is designed with disabled people in mind. All on one level, with all areas fully accessible and all furnished to the highest standard. The dairy was opened in 2017,it was a Runner up in the UK Blue Badge-style Awards 2017 and is one of only a few UK accommodation providers which provides accessibility with mobility,visual and hearing support to National Accessibility Scheme Standards. There is an excellent selection of facilities and equipment provided in this accommodation, including a luxurious walk in shower! "
4333,Fantastic hosts and staff - nothing is too much trouble.
4334,"The accessible toilet at Cavendish Pavillion is RADAR locked. It was clean and well stocked and the hand dryer had sufficient vigour to actually dry wet hands, which seems rare. There was a very strange noise in the toilet. It sounded like a ghost train or something at a fairground. Most odd!   My only complaint was that later in the day, the ladies toilets were closed for cleaning and everyone was told to use the accessible toilet. This led to quite a queue and by the time I got in, the cleanliness had gone steeply downhill!"
4335,"The accessible toilet is too small, so that it's very hard to manoeuvre and turn once you're inside. In addition the rubbish bins take up far too much space and make the transfer to the toilet very hard. The toilet is usable, but it's uncomfortable and far from ideal."
4336,Would be excellent if there weren't beer kegs stored here sometimes!
4337,"Toilets in themselves are good, with right transfer, decent size. However if at other end of restaurent difficult to get to through all the tables. Tip- if toilet is essential ask for a table close to."
4338,"I agree with another reviewer that the doors are very heavy, luckily for me, the doors are open all the time to improve ventilation as a result of the pandemic which is great for easy access. I have found the staff to be lovely and will go out of their way to accommodate me as a wheelchair user. The reception area is positioned in such a way that they would be able to spot someone struggling with the door. Before the pandemic when the doors were closed, I would wave from the door to get help. Perhaps a doorbell would be a helpful improvement?  When I go for an eye test I normally phone and let them know that I'm in a wheelchair so that they know I'll need extra room. But I recently used the online booking system for the first time but have been told that wheelchair users should only book through the phone – which is disappointing. I had to rearrange my appointment due to accessibility issues despite there being no indication on the website that the room linked with the chosen date was inaccessible. Hopefully, this is something which can be improved for the future. The eye test chair is removed for my test so that I can back my wheelchair into the space, and this negates the need for transferring (which I can no longer do). If you have an eye test booked upstairs, then it can be accessed by the back door which is easy to get to by going through the alleyway – although it is quite narrow. The shop is quite difficult to navigate with a wheelchair due to the limited space. I've got to be very careful when maneuvering past all of the equipment which is quite difficult especially when I need a new pair of glasses lol.  It would be helpful if Specsavers Elgin highlighted the procedures, they have in place to help people with disabilities to avoid confusion and aid in a smoother visit. I believe that the staff do the best they can with the resources they have."
4339,This is large and has enough space for a carer it is easily accessible from the cafe.   It was very busy the day we came so probably was very well used.
4340,"It's great to find a cottage which is all ground floor, with a wet room and which accepts my dog.  A few simple adaptations would help to make the cottage even more comfortable and safe for disabled people. If you can walk/stand a little, then this cottage may be suitable for you. Despite ramped entrance, wide doorways, lowered light switches etc, I doubt full time wheelchair users would manage here because of the bathroom arrangements. However you may find it suitable for you."
4341,Staff were superb. Helping us with the lifts and directions.
4342,"Heres a bit of a pill because being London, like down the road from kings cross, it is a major road. I went both times in a taxi and have either had to cross the road to get to the venue or be dropped off at fire exit type door and go all the way round. Which when there is a queue round the building can be a bit slow."
4343,Very large with easy access. Grab handles. Room for carer. Same nice toiletries as the ordinary lavatories.
4344,A disabled parking bay is located in the car park.
4345,"Fine for wheelchair access from the street and even though it was busy. It wasn't too cramped inside. There is a heavy curtain over the entrance door, which is not helpful for wheelchair user if you don't have someone to push the curtain out of the way!"
4346,"After being taken over the grass car park and along the level hard path up to castle reception, the ground floor was on the level, and we saw such a lot, sadly it seems we missed some rooms, so will return to see these later. We cannot remember any steps to spoil our visit, and as it’s grade 1 listed, there will be no lift. But the magnificent rooms can all be viewed by you."
4347,"Disabled parking spaces are available in the main car park adjacent to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Parking is also available by Dunsapie Loch, St. Maragert's Loch and Duddingston Loch."
4348,"For all you people wanting to go wall climbing, this is the place to go!! I can safely say that you will not be disappointed if this is your thing. Wheel chair accessible and fully equipped to enable people with a range of disabilities to climb the wall. All the staff are friendly and helpful and on hand to offer advice."
4349,"Very friendy, helpful and listened to me "
4350,I didnt find any accessible toilets. On the ground floor there are regular toilets.   In my room although there was no toilet grab rail I was able to easily use the vanity unit to help me up. 
4351,"We had a powered wheelchair and my husband was able to stand; the shower room was fine.  A slight ramp into the bathroom which could be a bit disorientating when not in a wheelchair perhaps especially being on a boat.  But easy for a wheelchair user. There was a higher toilet and grab rails, emergency cord."
4352,"The museum focuses on Crete’s ancient history with Minoan, Greek and Roman artefacts. There is also a garden area. The entire museum is step free."
4353,The doors  to new look are perminitely open  and you can get  round half of store quite easily.but then there are some shelves  with nick nacks on where you can only just turn around  the lift is very little
4354,Staff were very friendly and helpful 
4355,Staff are very friendly and happy to help and answer any questions.
4356,They didn't do much. 
4357,"Very accessible building, accessible toilets readily available. red cords in all toilets tied up at shoulder height when standing, all untied and red cord cards placed."
4358,High quality English speaking taxi tours from Le Havre Cruise Port. Normandie. Paris. Honfleur. Landing beaches. Ypres etc. 
4359,"A level entrance with wide automatic doors  The circulating spaces are good, though the loo shares a corridor with a computer and music synthesizer area, so users need to be careful when coming out - the door swings outwards and you might hit some budding composer or techno-geek."
4360,"It's possible to park just outside the village, with bays and double yellows available for those with blue badges. There are also black cabs (wheelchair accessible) at one end of the village and halfway down to take you home after!"
4361,"Firstly, I am pretty convinced that when I was in the store, so is every other tourist in London. If you can handle crowds, and when I say crowds I mean people coming at you from every direction, then please do visit because the story is marvellous. Every colour, every type and every shape of M&M is available in a whole host of interesting tubs as well as clothing, bags, mugs. Everything a real M&M fan could desire!"
4362,"There are accessible toilets and I visited the one situated adjacent to the cafe and gallery space under the vessel. It was modern, it even had an automated door, was spotlessly clean and had grab rails and all that you might expect."
4363,"The hotel is very accessible.  Throughout the ground floor which is where the reception, dining room, bar and restaurant are all located is on one level.  There are ample lifts and if you book the accessible room it has a large bathroom and two single electric rising beds.  The corners were quite tight in some places but we did have a large electric wheelchair with us.  A standard manual chair should be fine.  The tables in the breakfast hall have quite a high clearance so my mum could fit under with ease.  Some cobbles outside the entrance are the only real let down."
4364,The only stall we did some shopping at was fine but not much talking done
4365,"It's in central London, so not easy to drive to or park at.  There is public transport nearby; buses, taxis, underground (Monument, and Bank are the nearest underground stations) but it depends upon your own needs which is most suitable. "
4366,This is an HNS Lanarkshire venue and is on a pedestrian area of Graham St. There are two ways in to the building via the Main entrance on Graham St or via the rear of the building from the car par area.  if you enter via the main entrance there are a few steps however the door is also level with the Street as well. There are lifts to all of the 3 floors with in the building from both entrances. There is also a reception desk at the front entrance this was not in use when we visited.
4367,Doesn't always smell as clean as it should
4368,"Our stay at  hope Cross cottage was lovely. The only thing we could find to feedback whether following, Would have been helpful to have salt and pepper for use on table. A rail on double bed to grab would be helpful we have one at home which goes under the mattress to help sit up. I can walk a couple of foot with crutches and managed to get to double room as prefer to sleep with my husband but struggled to turn over. To make use of this lovely cottage you need to be willing to sleep in single beds or have some mobility. Everything else was lovely, an excellent, beautiful cottage, Thank you"
4369,Helpful staff and a layout which did not require furniture to be moved to accomodate my wheelchair surprised the pessimist in me who has grown weary of these barriers!  Food with flavours we could taste and define rather than a mishmash made for a delightful evening and a huge sense of relief in the dark gloomy January weather! Staff went out of their way to deal with my allergies with no fuss and I had zero complaints of the whole experience. My hopes are this is the same of other locations! The waiting staff were able to point out the current offers and deals which is always good and the restaurant was busy but staff were unflustered by this which is a talent in itself! Will definitely be back with my children who are fussy about which items should be in their favourite Italian dishes!
4370,Disabled parking was available directly across the road from the stadium and there looked as though there were also a couple of disabled parking bays actually within the complex.
4371,Level access all round. Wheelchair available to borrow at reception. 
4372,"Level access from the car all the way through the changing rooms and into the pool! Wide automatic doors at the front entrance leading to a spacious reception area, top marks."
4373,"There's an accessible loo on the ground floor which was large enough, although could have been a bit cleaner. The door opens out which is good. I'm not sure about upper floors."
4374,"There is one step into the restaurant from the street. However, the restaurant has installed a button for wheelchair users at the door. When we pressed it, the staff immediately appeared with an excellent ramp system which was set up within a minute. They offer further help getting inside if required. Once inside manoeuvring is fine as the tables are not too close together. The tables themselves are high enough to sit under with ease."
4375,We were looking for a fun and accessible place for beers and pub food for 8 and someone recommended this place - awesome!  Got in touch to make a booking - explained that there were 2 wheelchair users in our group. Got a reply saying no problem and that they would reserve some tables for us in the bar as restaurant had a couple of steps.  When we got there our table was reserved - the staff member came over to introduce herself - said they didn’t normally do table service in the bar area but they would for our group - super helpful throughout they evening.  It’s a great location on the Thames - v near Shakespeare’s globe and the Tate - definitely going to become one of our regular haunts when in London. 
4376,"Getting to the cathedral for a wheelchair user could be tricky, there are narrow paths and a cobbled street. There is a longer route to the cathedral which is slightly easier and is via the cloisters. There is disabled parking available on Palace Green and there is also a shuttle bus that has wheelchair access (although this was tested on the day)."
4377,There are designated spaces round the entrance. We have never had a problem parking even on event days.
4378,Excellent as stated in my review.
4379,I only went into the gardens (not the castle itself) which were really easy to get around. The gardens are generally quite flat and there are excellent ramps to negotiate the steps. The paths are wide and good for wheelchairs. Some of the smaller formal gardens are not as accessible as the paths are smaller but that is a small part of the garden and you can peek into them.
4380,The cafe is in a padestrianised road next to Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Peña de Francia. Cafe is on level ground but  surrounding streets have slopes. Taxis would be able to make a level stop nearby. 
4381,The first challenge when I went to an event here was finding out how to get in as a wheelchair user. The premises are situated on. First floor above the shops and supermarkets of the Kirkgate shopping Centre.
4382,"Very central location, just outside Castle Walls, and with level access (though far too many cobbles) to the Castle and Cathedral. Disabled parking directly outside the door of the accessible room. Fully accessible room on ground floor, with access to hotel reception and dining room via step free (though sloping) outdoor path. Wet room with fixed seat in the shower, grab rails and non-slip floor.  The wet room is good, but not entirely well thought out.  The shower seat is too low.  The only mirror is above and to the side of the toilet, rather than above the basin, so no good for shaving, and cannot be seen by anyone in a wheelchair or who cannot stand for long.  There was no hot water in the basin, and the kettle provided for tea making could not fit in the basin to be filled. The bed(s) are slightly raised, so easy to get out of.  There is the option of a large double or 2 twin beds.  We had the double, and it was very comfortable. We just stayed the one night and it was very good for what we needed"
4383,"No trip to Edinburgh is complete without a visit to the word-renowned Edinburgh Castle – the focal point for the entire city and a common position for anyone looking to find their bearings when gallivanting around town, as the Castle protrudes high into the Edinburgh skyline, proudly perched on top of Castle Rock.   The cobbled path up to the main courtyard of the castle is quite steep, and with thousands of tourists flocking to visit the castle every day – it can also appear quite busy too. There used to be a vehicle which would ferry disabled visitors to and from the main castle grounds – however, upon my arrival, I was disappointed to hear that this service wasn’t operational. I’m unsure if this was just due to it still being the off season, or if because they’ve scrapped the service entirely?  Having visited numerous castles in the past, in destinations dotted all around the world, I was pleasantly surprised by how accessible Edinburgh Castle is. My friends and I were a bit pressed for time when we visited, but every exhibition room we went in had adequate accessibility, with many of the rooms having side entrances and lift access for wheelchair users. Staff were on hand to offer assistance and were all really pleasant and cheery. You know, the type of folk you just want to remain friends with?!  Don’t even think about missing out Edinburgh Castle if you’re ever in the Scottish capital city – and with any accessibility worries out the window – what’re you waiting for? "
4384,There is space to move about in a wheelchair on all floors and doors are wide enough to let you through.
4385,"There is no car park for this restaurant however, there is a council car park a 5-minute walk away and on street parking close by. There are lots of bus stops up and down the Perth Road which most buses stop and there are taxi ranks nearby too. Train station is roughly a 15-minute walk away."
4386,"Unfortunately as I went in March, the Lighthouse was closed. However, we did see some beautiful puffins but that is all we seen -_-"
4387,All staff very helpful and friendly with Kim being especially helpful!  It Is no surprise that they have a World Host award for their level of service ! Thank You Alll !
4388,Parked in a disabled bay near the venue & it was flat all the way there.
4389,Not many toilets around the place. Toilets are not disabled friendly
4390,"As mentioned above, it’s not super accessible to big chairs, but once you’re in it’s nice and spacious."
4391,Good disabled toilet beside reception. Only negative is the disabled toilets are inside the ordinary toilets so I found that awkward as my husband usually pushes me to the toilet.
4392,"Small, accessible cafe-restaurant in the centre of Dawlish, with accessible toilet. Serves lovely food."
4393,Accessible toilets can be found through the venue and can be access with a radar key. If  disabled customers don’t have their own radar key they can ask staff for assistance. The disabled toilets however are very small and can’t fit both wheelchair user and thier career in. 
4394,The Victoria Palace Theatre has allocated private boxes at the rear of the stalls to wheelchair users and their companions. The rear of the stalls has a slight restricted view but the boxes are spacious enough for a power chair user and at least 2 companions if necessary. Tickets for disabled and carers are discounted and seem to be readily available for Hamilton. Staff were amazing from the moment we arrived to our departure.
4395,There is a toilet and an accessible shower room. The toilet is arge and easy to manouver in. There are plenty of grab rails. For those needing more space there is a larger shower room available. The room has an accessible shower and toilet. The toilets are easy to find and clearly signposted. 
4396,"There are plenty of disabled parking spaces at Monks Cross with allocated spaces in each parking zone apart from zone D. Parking that is not so obvious to the left of Pizza Hut and in front of Hobbie craft and Monsoon. There is a 4 hour limit on parking. However, if you wish to stay longer just pop into the information centre and notify the security team of your car registration to avoid penalty charges. There is a regular Park and Ride facility that goes into York centre should the mood take you. There are also regular bus routed that literally run through the park. All busses as far as i'm aware are ones that are able to lower level to the kerb to allow wheelchairs to board with a space near the front for the wheelchair. Unfortunately pushchairs are often in this space."
4397,i did not have any dealings with the staff but the place is well maintained
4398,"Can’t fault anything here at all a large spacious airport, not cramped and with clean and regularly serviced facilities. Our transfers there and back were faultless. There appeared to be excellent car hire and parking facilities for those who could drive non and mobility adaptive vehicles. Bus and train service connected to the airport all within short distance, there was mobility assistance available given the ramping throughout the airport.."
4399,"This was our first stay at  Homelands which was booked on behalf of our daughter who is disabled. She needs the use of a powerchair for use outside and walking aids for indoor use. The facility was nothing short of amazing with your every need catered for ! All bedlinen,  towels, crockery, in fact the whole Kit caboodle!!  We were in the Kiel Lodge which allows dogs and they even provided the ground stake that you  attach your dogs collar to. The lodge itself is very spacious with large doors with the lounge / kitchen in an open  plan style.  Entry to the main users room is by double opening doors with a access to hoists and any other equipment you may need ! The decor is modern  with fantastic lighting first rate Smeg appliances and comfortable seating! Basically a home from home  that is anything but basic, in fact Homeland matches, if not surpasses anything I have ever seen before - it's incredible!  On first look at the pricing it may seem expensive, however if you have the 6 allowed (or 8) then it becomes a bargain.  We would wholeheartedly recommend this facility to anyone that has struggled to find a base for a holiday that is so hard too find for a disabled user. You really Must give Homelands a try !! "
4400,"Although buses pass down the main road, not sure how close by they stop. We drove - there are two disabled spaces in the car park.  The main car park gets busy - there is an overflow car park but it's at the top of a steep slope."
4401,"The staff, especially in the Bothy Bar, were very friendly and helpful - and Sarah deserves a special mention!"
4402,The Mercure sits on Princes Street and has some great views over the gardens and the castle.
4403,"Absolutely fantastic service, I rented an electric wheelchair to avoid taking mine abroad in case the airline damaged it. The chair I was provided with was fantastic for the terrain and enabled me to go wherever I wanted independently. The gentleman Frederico met me at the hotel lobby at the time arranged and as he was running late we left the chair in the lobby with reception for collection. I am quite small and of course rental chairs are generally larger than ones I require but we found it very easy to use pillows and my own cushions from my manual wheelchair to make it suitable - however it maybe necessary that certain extra cushions are taken to make the chairs fit every individual. The chair we hired was a Terra which I'd not heard of before but was definitely the best electric wheelchair I've hired abroad. It had a great range, managed small kerbs and bumps with ease, had a small wheelbase with great turning circle and fitted on all the buses easily. It definitely made the holiday a holiday for all. I'd definitely recommend Amigo 24 for any electric wheelchair hire in the future if we end up in an area that they operate in. They also hire out manual wheelchairs and mobility scooters as well as other mobility and disability aids which can be incredibly handy and helpful whilst away on holiday. "
4404,It's a short distance - around 200m - from the nearest bus stop. There is plenty of parking outside but didin't notice if there were any dedicated Blue Badge parking spaces.
4405,Very helpfull and attentive - they were alsoproficient and very fast
4406,"Toilets were we'll sign posted, in good condition and very spacious."
4407,What a wonderful Cottage and excellent hosts. First trip with my mum since she had her leg amputated. Cottage had everything we needed and is in a lovely location with sensational views. Thoroughly recommend 
4408,"To access The Clipper, you need to go up a ramp too steep for anyone in a self propelled wheelchair - unless you have a carer with you. Once up the ramp, negotiating around customers and tables is easy enough. Most of the food and drink is reachable too. You would not be able to get a mobility scooter up the ramp. If you have mobility issues you could not cope with the steep incline either."
4409,What promised to be a great few days away turned into a nightmare. When you contact a hotel and go through all the hoops to book a wheelchair accessible room with wet room thats what you expect to get when you arrive. Apparently not if you stay here!
4410,Parked outside despite it being a weekend.
4411,Very friendly
4412,There were ramps for outside access and very large lifts inside. All shops were at floor level and could be accessed by wheelchair users. 
4413,"There is a permanent concrete ramp with a gradual incline at the front entrance, just beside a set of around three steps.  There was plenty of room at the entrance, but you do go past an ice-cream stall/small shop area, so it could potentially become busy at times.  We had pre-booked and informed them that one of the people in our group used a wheelchair. They had reserved a table for us downstairs (there are some tables upstairs too), and it was near the main walkway when we entered which meant we didn't have to get past other tables."
4414,"Access round the ruins is understandably not good for wheelchairs or sticks, but there is a good path which gives you lovely views over the ruins. More chairs in grounds would be useful. Access to visitor centre and café is very good."
4415,Couldn't be more helpful and probably more important genuinely happy to help.
4416,"There are toilets as you come through the main gates, next to Court Yard Cafe, room for a Carer. All toilet are in the one area and well signed. There are more Toilets downstairs in the house next to The Restaurant, Disabled is on left hand side, there are 2 disabled toilets here and are well signed and room for a carer There are No toilets whilst going around the House, we had to come out and back down the stair lift. Staff were understanding  and helped with a short cut out."
4417,"The staff are A🌟M🌟A🌟Z🌟I🌟N🌟G So helpful, professional, friendly, fun and patient,"
4418,"Castel Sant'Angelo is an impressive looking fortress sitting by the River Tiber. The castle is clearly ancient and it is by no means 100% accessible, but they have tried to make access easier in large parts of the attraction."
4419,"Wonderful. Always helpful and sensitive to your needs and those of others. kath ( boss lady ) cannot be more helpful, and spot on when knowing when to offer help or not."
4420,"Since the stadium's upgrading twenty odd years ago, disabled facilities have improved although they're still not brilliant.  Being a season ticket/pass holder, I have a seat upstairs for the Edinburgh games and pitchside for internationals.  Being a rugby avid, I love coming to this venue."
4421,Large disabled toilet. Through slightly heavy double doors to enter toilet area
4422,"The site is level which is great for the chair, the views are spectacular.  There is a disabled toilet and shower room which is very large. It has a fully accessible shower with shower seat on the wall. There are plenty of grab bars around the room. There is also a thermostat in the room allowing you to make the room warmer if needed. To access disabled facilities you request a key on arrival and hand it back when you leave the site. The staff were really friendly and helpful. Small onsite shop for the essentials too.  Site also allows dogs .Well worth a visit"
4423,"Approachable, professional and polite. Needed reminding that they could talk to me about my requirements rather than go through my Wife!"
4424,We met the owners who could not do enough to make sure we had a good stay
4425,within the venue there are wheelchair accessible toilets which require Radar Key to access.  the key is available from a reception desk.   The toilet is large enough to accommodate a chair and has grab and drop rail.   there is an alarm chord which hung vertically to near ground.    There is a suitable waste bin.   Soap and hand dryer are accessible from a chair.    
4426,Accessible loo at station tea room. Accessed from platform. Good size. However I’m afraid it’s not well equipped with grab rails. Some will cope (I used to)but I find it too difficult to use now.
4427,There were lots of disabled toilets located on the same floor as the cinema and close to the screens to allow access. Within the toilets there were a red pull chord which was labelled in the case of an emergency and there was also grab rails in the correct places around the toilet. There was enough space in the toilet to move the wheelchair around and also for a friend/carer to stay in the toilet if needed. The toilets were reasonably clean and tidy.
4428,"The path around the main park is good quality and there are several smaller paths that go to the band stand in the middle. The back path has a few uneven bits, but nothing too bad.   Around the field is a dirt track. This is quite uneven and in winter, it gets waterlogged. I generally take my freewheel or mountain trike if I want to go all the way round the field. Park run uses the field and so isn't a great one for wheelchairs, which is a shame.  Apparently, some funding has been provided to improve the field path and make it asphalt and wide enough for wheelchairs and pushchairs. This is due to be done in the next year."
4429,Couldn't fault it! We were very apprehensive beforehand as hadn't travelled that route on a match day before. We went via Glasgow Central and then Mount Florida. Helpful staff at each point. On way back the mounted police directed us to the accessible entrance to Mount Florida station (which also meant we skipped the queue - hurrah!). From Mount Florida it's only a short distance to Hampden.   Re parking - a pal always travels by car and there is a decent sized blue badge car park at Hampden.
4430,"A real depth of paintings from recent to medieval. Some  famous ones like When Did You Last See Your Father.  A few Lowerys and Epsteins.   Venue easily accessed via a ramp. Cafe in foyer, and accessible toilet and a lift to first floor. "
4431,Really proactive. Go over the top to help. Go beyond the call of duty to help. 
4432,"There are adequate disabled access at the estate with ramps almost to all the sites. There are only a few stairs at the site. There is ramped access to the shop and automatic doors. The entrance to the tea room is level with clear open space. There is also a lift  that provides access to all floors for wheelchair users, however, electric wheelchairs are not allowed in the house and pushchairs cannot be pushed around the house. Meanwhile all of the grounds, gardens and walled gardens are fully accessible. Push wheelchair users might struggle on some of the areas like the Home Farm and the Stables courtyard. Many trails and walks are accessible but steep in parts.  Note that Electric wheelchairs must be left outside the tea rooms and Estate Office.  A manual wheelchair is however available at the entrance of the house to borrow during visit. Unfortunately wheelchair users are not offered assistance around the house. The Estate Office can be contacted on (011)33367560 to book manual wheelchair and terrain mobility scooters to use outdoors. Entry to the Temple Newsam is free for carers."
4433,"Access to the site was very good.  Once inside, the ground was a bit rough when going between the areas"
4434,Fab staff
4435,It's not as good as it used to be as taxis were able to take you into the main booking office and platform area. The compromise works but may be too difficult for some disabled people.
4436,brilliant accessible and thought out facilities with very friendly and helpful staff.
4437,"All staff were extremely helpful from the time we arrived, to make sure we understood the access provisions"
4438,Very helpful
4439,"There is level entry to the theatre and a lift down to the stalls. The lift is small and can take just one wheelchair at a time but is used by 8 plus wheelchair patrons plus anyone with limited mobility,"
4440,All flat entry from street.  Lift to accessible room.  Additional hall door before entry to room.  Doors are a bit heavy.
4441,Getting to the Pantheon may be a bit tricky for some as the streets around it are cobbled. However once you are there you'll find that it is fully accessible.
4442,"Top marks to the two staff we spoke to who explained where to go, how to use the lifts, and made us feel welcome."
4443,Nearest bus stop was right outside of the centre
4444,Improvements are being made and the venue is actively trying to be more accessible. There is a lift and step free access can be arranged to some seats.
4445,"Mollett's use Motionspot Bathrooms.  Their accessible bathrooms are beautiful – not clinical – whilst boasting everything that those with disabilities could need, from sensored mirrors that light up with a swipe of the hand, to gorgeous chrome grab rails and towel heaters that will never be hot enough to burn hands.  The best part of all? Most of this equipment is portable and can be removed within five minutes, although I seriously doubt that anyone who doesn’t require a shower seat or sink of wheelchair height would even recognise the difference; it is that stunning."
4446,"The pub has a large tarmac car park with several blue badge spaces. The car park is on a slight hill, but the disabled spaces are on the level. There is room to drop someone off if these spaces are occupied."
4447,"Pretty decent accessible toilet, see pic!"
4448,Ramp from promenade
4449,I was using a stroller walking frame and was helped throughout. Lift would take wheelchairs or scooters too
4450,"I popped in for my breakfast Danish pastry and coffee. I had hardly appeared in front of the shop before a sweet young man rushed to the door to ask if I needed assistance, and then promptly got me a very sturdy ramp. Delightful service at the counter, and before I had even turned round to leave, another sweet young man was putting the ramp in place again. The staff at this branch have really got it right: accessibility is just part of their normal day, no fuss, no trouble. Congratulations all round."
4451,"The lift up to the cinema was broken. No sign on it telling us this or apologising. A Vue employee had to take us on a long route to a filthy and ramshackle service lift which, she said, keeps breaking down, and an engineer had got stuck in it for an hour recently. We were led through a disgustingly filthy service area (rotting food smeared all over the floor) to the back of the cinema. The wheelchair space is a few feet in front of the screen, MUCH too close to the screen, so it was impossible to watch the film with any pleasure. I will never go there again."
4452,"I am going from memory, but I am sure it would have stuck in my mind if I had any great difficulty using the loo.  My only difficulty was trying to get in, as other patrons ""just nip in"", because it's the first door they found."
4453,Disabled parking is very close to main entrance for the hotel.
4454,very easy if you drive
4455,Toilets are located in the St. Enoch Shopping center. The all clean with plenty of space for career. The toilets also lock and unlock without much effort. Clean and well stocked with toilet roll.
4456,"Lovely 'staff' (is that the right word in a cathedral?), friendly, informative, helpful, and one woman in particular was a live wire, great fun to chat with."
4457,"Clapham Junction Station is spitting distance away. On a good day you can get prompt ramp assistance there when boarding or leaving any train, though the assistance service can be patchy and a bit random. The London Overground also serves this station, and their ramp assistance is almost always completely reliable and friendly. Many bus routes serve this immediate area too, so for wheelchair users it's a good place to go shopping."
4458,The Scotch Whisky Experience has to be one of the must see attractions if you are venturing out on to Edinburgh’s Royal Mile. We visited on a  rainy morning and were glad to seek shelter! That said we were soon exchanted by the story of whisky - even more so when we discovered there was a barrel ride. What we didn’t expect was for the ride to have a wheelchair accessible barrel. Wheeling aboard our adventure began as you are taken through the story of whisky production.
4459,I have never had any complaints re the staff as they have always been very friendly and helpful
4460,"There is step-free, level access through wide automatic doors leading from the car park to the shop. Inside, the shop is quite packed full, but the corridors are wide enough for a wheelchair user to browse comfortably. Items aren't stacked too high on most shelves which is good. There are lots of pets to look at, including the very popular rabbits in the centre of the shop. There is also an induction loop inside. The counters at the checkout are quite high however."
4461,"Entrance to the experience is through a circular automatic glass door, you then go along a corridor to the ticket desk.  The experience starts with a barrel ride which tells you the story of how whisky is created - there is one accessible barrel which requires users to reverse onto the barrel. The only issue is the lighting levels are quite low so it can be difficult to see well. There is space for one other person in the barrel too.   After the barrel ride (approx 8 minutes) you then go through to some short exhibitions, there were audio tours available at this point. There is a lift to take you up to the first floor, once this is done you are taken into a room for a talk, video and chance to choose your whisky of choice. I really liked the palate postcard which will help you to choose a whisky that you will like!   After this you are taken along the corridor into the largest private whisky collection in the world and taught how to 'taste' whisky.   To exit the experience if you require the lift you'll be advised to go through a 'staff only' door along a corridor to take you back to the lift."
4462,"It's amazing! There is an accessable walk which is completely wheelchair accessible just a bit harder in some places but it's ok. The bird hide even had a cut out so you can actually get to the window more easily. The building and cafe is mostly accessable with cut outs so you can fit under the till to pay and see what to eat. The maps don't have braille but one of them is tactile. All the staff wore masks and there is hand sanitizer at every entrance. The disabled toilets are locked so you need a RADAR key or ask a member of staff. I've attached photos of what it looks like. But there is a shower, two emergency cords, hospital bed, toilet with arm supports and hand free flushing, an adjustable sink (it has a control thing so you can make it go up or down) a foldable partition so you can have privacy if you need a carer and a lifting sling if you can't use your legs but need the shower. It has a lot of room to move around too."
4463,Space to side of caravan. Did not use public transport
4464,The staff are wonderful. They are all very cheerful and chatty. Anytime my wife has had any issues getting about in her powerchair they are straight there to help her. Once when the queue was away up the stairs of a nearby close they saw my wife waiting off to the side for me to get back into street level and brought the menu out to her so she could choose her own flavours. 
4465,"I used my own wav, parking is no problem, plenty of disabled parking."
4466,There isn't a lot of interaction with staff.
4467,"Very nice people, willing but untrained."
4468,"The trekking centre has a 3 bedroom holiday cottage which is suitable for wheelchair users. There is a double bedroom, a wet floor shower room, kitchen and sitting room on the ground level. There are two additional bedroom upstairs with two more bathrooms. The lower level is easy to move around in a wheelchair and the kitchen has lowered surfaces. The cottage is literally in the centre of everything so there are stables directly opposite and a barn with horses in it to the side. During the day it is a hive of activity, literally outside your window.Despite this it feels private but some people might not like this. Everyone was very friendly. It isn't possible to park directly beside the cottage but the car park is nearby, although I needed help to be pushed to my car. The centre also organise riding for the disabled but I didn't look into this. Wellow is a 10 min drive to the edge of Bath along a narrow country road. The park and ride is at the end of this road and is fully accessible. If you like horses , you will love it but even if you don't,  this is a great cottage and has good access to Bath and the surrounding area."
4469,A practical city which because of climate has most things indoors. Perfect place to see northern Lights 
4470,"You will find the disabled toilet by reception, but make sure ladies you got down to see the very posh toilet that awaits you, we have never seen any like these before."
4471,Been here a few times. Disabled parking at door. Farm shop includes excellent butchery by Puddledub. Cafe is spacious and serves good food though getting in can sometimes be difficult as you pass through busy gift shop.
4472,"Parking was right next to the front door and level, thus providing easy access to and from the vehicle."
4473,"This delightful hotel sits in an area that boasts open countryside and woodland views designated as a Green Belt, while small leaved Lime trees reflect the ancient origins of its woodlands. The Limes was standing here from the late 1800’s, , but the present family run Tudor style hotel was established in 2006 when Mr David Morris purchased the hotel, and with a 1.5 million pound project, added many more bedrooms, and installed a restaurant and bar, and developed the grounds, so that today we see a very nice hotel that stands in 6 acres of tended well maintained grounds with a cottage like olde worlde feel about its Tudor kept buildings that offers character and warmth. You have free parking, with we believe 27 bedrooms that offer plain simple nicely decorated rooms, and pictures found on internet show that many have showers, with a small step, good sized well appointed modern beds, and most certainly clean and well looked after. The bar lounge is a pleasant comfortable place to sit and enjoy a coffee break, or later on, a most enjoyable cocktail, which we can recommend, and the Admirals restaurant offers an extensive enough menu that will delight you, as you gaze across the garden view. An after dinner stroll across the grounds to the far pool will Offer a pleasant experience, with a walk across compressed chippings on its pathways through well maintained grounds.  OUR REVIEW Our arrival was easy enough after driving through open countryside and the gateway was a nice looking entrance, but husband not so impressed with the compressed chippings on the driveway. But there is a reasonable well maintained car park. (photo 1) while there are bays nearer the hotel entrance which disabled may use, (photo 2) overlooking a small pond and over to the Tudor style country lodge. The main entrance was not clearly signed, so not sure how to get in, it has a pull handle doorway with a small tread to get over (3) and you pass a very plain small box like affair, just a practical reception (4) which leads to the bar, (5) always a focal point of attraction. We sat in the lounge and there are very comfortable and relaxing seats in the open lounge area  6) as you order a drink or two. While waiting, we looked into the Admirals restaurant (photo 7) which looked very pleasant and well maintained furniture (8)  When weather permits a small terrace would make for a delightful break (9) or perhaps choose to sit on the lawn on the benches available (10).  A pathway leads across to pass the marquee (11) and on towards the chippings that holds the path to take you across to the far pool, while the very impressive marquee holds promise of some delightful weddings taking place here (12) which looks inviting, spacious and well looked after (13). Inside hotel, a nice small functions room is available for those special occasions (14), However our special treat was to enjoy a cocktail (15) while we admired the open fireplace and wood burner (16) which brightened up the day. A short corridor led to toilets (17) which are just basic and with minimal fuss (18). After our cocktail we ventured outside again to view the bedrooms, located in refurbished cottages (19) before departing this delightful lodge. (20)."
4474,I traveled in my car and parked in the Ice Rink car park. However the car park was very uneven and required help from an able bodied person.
4475,Only 2 spaces but is a small harvester
4476,No disabled parking space as far as we could see but parking seemed plentiful in their car park and we parked right by the ramped entrance.  There are buses (the pub had an information folder inside with timetables for buses from major towns nearby).
4477,"We used two accessible minibuses and they were great. Seating could be moved to accommodate wheelchair users, the journey felt safe, and the staff excellent."
4478,Large toilet. Wheelchair accessible but no handrails
4479,"The Glen Nevis self-catering park is an easy drive from Fort William, and you can park by your caravan. There are buses too, with stops outside the park, but I didn't test their accessibility."
4480,There was ramped access into the building and down onto the recess area. The ramp down to recess area was quite narrow and the none slip mat had bunched up slightly. There was a rail on the right of the ramp. There was a lift up to the upper floors but the lift said it cannot take scooters. I did not see an induction loop or braille labels. There was plenty of seating. The doors were fire doors and were not electric. There was an emergency evacuation chair upstairs. 
4481,Unsure as we came on foot. There is some on street parking but it will get very busy in festival time. There are buses that go through too.
4482,"The inner courtyard and castle are not accessible at all by motorised wheelchairs/scooters because of the damage they could cause - in the extensive (and beautiful) gardens they can be used. Manual wheelchairs can be used in the inner courtyard, which is very small but can not go in the castle. Access to the higher floors is by a challenging stone spiral staircase, although the staff will let those with difficulty descend by the main staircase which is normally out of bounds. Staff are helpful and there are chairs dotted around to take a rest. Good access to shops/cafe and model house display"
4483,"Definitely accessible but as with many disabled toilets in Aberdeenshire, no red cord!"
4484,"Hoa Lo Prison is a historical relic built by French colonialists in 1896 and displays the changing history of Vietnam including Vietnamese and American prisoners.  There is step free access to the prison although some areas may not be accessible  (and a small section on the second floor which is not accessible - about 20 steps up but with hand rails on each side).  Signs in Vietnamese, English and French but quite small print. Lots of photos. "
4485,I observed the accessible beach area at Benidorm. Established by the council this was clearly marked and seemed well used. The large covered area included a changing area hut and accessible toilets. Aquachairs were available for people to go out into the sea. They were very popular.
4486,"If one could give more than 5, I would do so.  All the staff we dealt with were excellent and went out of there way to make our stay an enjoyable one"
4487,very pleasant. I can't fault them.
4488,"Public parking is difficult in Paris, I would recommend using a cab, unless you know someone who knows the city well."
4489,"Lovely friendly service, spook english, let us try anything before hand, even let my daughter charge her mobile up."
4490,Plenty of disabled parking available near the entrance and regularly checked by the staff
4491,Level access into shop with automatic doors. Seating available near till. Hearing loop sign spotted. Shelves were high. Didn't see a designated accessible till. Wheelchair accessible trolley available. 
4492,"It is adjacent to    Buchanan Street bus station, there is  also  an  NCP carpark within  yards of the restaurant.  I'm not hundred percent sure about the availability  of   Disabled car parking facilities on the street,   As I don't drive   And have always  arrived at the  restaurant  via my electric  wheelchair."
4493,Accessible toilet available at lower level but did not visit so cannot comment.
4494,"I usually use a walking aid but for gardens etc where the walking would be too much for me I book a mobility scooter. Batsford has Trampers for hire at a low cost (even cheaper if you are a temporary or annual member of Countryside Mobility South West. http://www.countrysidemobility.org/  If you haven't tried one, Trampers are heavy duty scooters which mean you can access all the parts of the arboretum.  The arboretum is lovely at all times of the year."
4495,"Plenty of accessible parking close to the restaurant, the Outlet is served by a local bus service"
4496,"Paths around the statue are managebull without power, but not if alone."
4497,Seriously impressive food.  Wheelchair accessible to boot.  Don’t know about wc as didn’t try to use it.
4498,Good public transport links - is opposite London Bridge tube station which is on the (sort of) accessible  Jubilee Line.
4499,Wheelchair Accessible Theatre
4500,Very spacious and open hotel with four big lifts!!!
4501,Staff are more than happy to help in whatever why they can. 
4502,All on one level
4503,"Having experienced zoo visits before hopes weren't high. Arriving, browsing and meeting folk it soon became apparent this was going to be something different."
4504,This is a nice place to have lunch when visiting Edinburgh.  It feels super  posh but the bar meals cost more or less the same as anywhere else.   They also do breakfast and afternoon tea. 
4505,All parts of the tour were accessible.  Enough space for a large wheelchair in the lift.
4506,"Step-free, all on one floor."
4507,"The disabled toilet was spotlessly clean, roomy and may be easy enough to spin around in. The passage to reach it may be tight for powerchair though, so you will need to pick your route carefully. There are grab rails and pull cord."
4508,"Attended for a funeral, reasonably accessible, was able to plan ahead to attend through the Church of Scotland website. "
4509,"A lovely quiet walk for less than hour even if you do the loop in both directions. Spacious enough to allow 2 to walk side by side. Mostly flat. The walk is definitely 5 stars but there are no toilets and the car park is busy at weekends, and without marked spaces could make access more difficult."
4510,Level access into the building and a gradual ramp up to my table.
4511,The disabled WC in the main hotel is about 30 metres from Fletchers and about 5 from Shaun Rankins Restaurant. The grab rails are sufficient and there is enough room to turn around. It has always been clean & tidy
4512,"The disabled bathroom is through a manual door to one side of the bar; on the left is the disabled stall, and on the right the steps leading down to the other toilets. The disabled cubicle needs a radar key, which can be obtained from the bar if you don’t have one yourself. The bathroom itself has grab rails and emergency pull cords, but is very small and difficult to manoeuvre larger, powered wheelchairs around."
4513,"Everyone was very nice and helpful, right from when I originally phoned to book, and I particularly appreciated my chats with the groundsman Sandy, who told me about the accessible path along the river and passed on other useful information."
4514,Louisa from DSUK was very helpful in getting me kitted out and preparing the ski for me.
4515,"Really nice food and good service, had a great time. Went for a friend’s birthday and she enjoyed it.  Wheelchair access & disabled toilet information:  Overall: Good access and would recommend.  Plenty of disabled parking outside and gentle sloped access.   Wide doorways to enter but the doors aren’t automatic so may need help with opening.   Mostly flat and accessible inside. There’s quite an open plan style with plenty of width to get around. All doorways are nice and wide. Good space between tables to manoeuvre around. There are a small amount of tables that are up a step (and some in a boat!), but vast majority are on the flat. We got a river view table that was accessible.   Nicely tiled disabled / baby changing toilet. Not huge inside but space to manoeuvre. A standard, basic disabled loo so plenty of rails but no hoist or adult changing. A heads up the red emergency cord doesn’t hang all the way to the ground if you’re a fall risk. Door is manageable but quite heavy.   Had a nice time and would definitely go here again."
4516,"I had a great experience here! My partner and I are both autistic, as well as him relying on crutches/mobility aids and me being a deaf wheelchair user - which as you can imagine can make going to the cinema difficult. However, this cinema gives an array of accessible viewings - such as dementia-friendly, relaxed, and hard of hearing screenings, as well as reduced costs to allow carers to come for free. It was a bit confusing about where to show our tickets as there was no one at the door of the show, but everything was very open plan and all doors being power-assisted made such a difference!"
4517,"The staff at the pub were very friendly and opened the restaurant with a ramp. Also , other wheelchair users will understand this glee, they had a great loo for wheelchair users!! Plus great food and Prosecco.!! A really nice venue."
4518,Level footpaths throughout the Nature Park with the majority being hard surfaces.  Can be muddy in wet weather . Visitor centre /cafe access good and flat
4519,"Double doors, so plenty of room to get in, restaurant was spread out so easy to get through, and they had set up our table so there was lots of room for wheelchairs to get in and out.   The only thing i would say that we struggled with was that the menu was very small type, so some people couldn't read it."
4520,Not a huge accessible toilet and some emergency equipment is stored in there which makes it a little bit awkward but reasonable and the entryway is straight into the restaurant but not too close to a table.
4521,"Each store has their own staff of course, so the usual mix of attention, as per high street shops. However, each store was very attentive to my needs and helped wherever they could - can't expect better than that can you?"
4522,"Delicious food, will go back!"
4523,Blue Badge holders can arrange to park within the complex by prior notice. Information is available on the website.
4524,I did not notice any toilets.
4525,"Martin's Hotel Brugge is a wheelchair accessible hotel situated close to the main square in Bruges with a carpark just round the corner, spacious rooms and friendly staff."
4526,Drop down slope from car park. Wide automatic doors to pharmacy.
4527,"Really good! Nice and spacious inside with low tables and chairs, all moveable furniture and smooth floors. Calm atmosphere, quiet cafe. "
4528,The disabled access is good but if you suffer from spinal injuries than there isn’t any rides you can go on only at your own risk but that’s widely known. The reason for my low score is that the sealion show hasn’t got any places for those in wheelchairs/mobility scooters. So I wasn’t able to see anything due to everyone standing around the front of the poolside area. 
4529,"There is accessible toilets. These are spacious with grab rails and emergency cords. I think there are accessible toilets on all floors, but I only used the one by the Cromwell Road entrance."
4530,"Duquesne  has a ramped entrance a bit steeper than in the UK ,so depending on your arm strength you might need he'll. Santa Eularia has a commitment to be fully accessible. At least 90% of streets have dropped curbs."
4531,Freya was very helpful in restaurant  Food is of a very standard with great choice.
4532,No steps to most of the restaurant.one area is raised up but I have never had to go there as plenty of accessible tables .
4533,The toilets are down a floor but they are large and tidy with great wheelchair access.
4534,"We booked this site, way back during lockdown, when campsites were all booked up almost for the whole year. We were just glad to have found somewhere to get a week away. So checking accessibility wasn't my top priority. To be fair, when away in the motorhome, we have our own toilet and shower and as long as hubby is with me, most things are possible. If I'd have come here alone, I would have seriously struggled though."
4535,"Getting into the restaurant is probably my only concern at Byron. One entrance is up a set of steps, however the second main entrance is step-free. Well, I say step-free but it appears as though what was once a small step has been smoothed over with concrete to make a fairly steep lip to cross into the threshold. This might be a little tricky for some wheelchair users without assistance. Likewise, the door is quite heavy and it didn't look as though there would always be a member of staff handy to assist at this entrance (whereas there was a lady waiting by the door at the stepped entrance to seat guests). Once inside however access is fine. It is table service and many of the tables have moveable seats to allow for wheelchair access. The floors are smooth and there is plenty of space to move between tables. The restaurant is also very well lit."
4536,very helpful and knowledgeable
4537,"you can park in thetnearby Eastgate shopping centre or Morrison's car park. there is no on-street parking nearby, although it is near-ish the bus & train stations."
4538, The staff were friendly and helpful .  Even helped us choose what dishes to order.
4539,"The cottage was purpose built and designed for people with disabilities , particularly wheelchair users and it fitted the bill. No issues at all with moving around from cottage to car and inside cottage. Very spacious and wide doorways which made life much easier for us."
4540,We have sailed on cruise ships all over the world and by far this is the best cruise terminal we have ever used. The disabled are fastracked throughout the check-in process and personally escorted by one of the great staff to the ship entry gate. There is a dedicated disabled lift which is wheelchair friendly
4541,Friendly staff and owners.
4542,"Saint Martin de Re is the largest town on Ile de Re, a little island just of La Rochelle, on the French Atlantic Coast.  It's a chic location for Parisians in the school summer holidays. It's considered the French equivalent of the Hamptons. Saint Martin has a large port area which is surrounded by shops, cafes and restaurants. There is also an Old Town area and some Fortifications surrounding the town. "
4543,I use a basic power chair to move about but as long as you long as you stick to the paths (the grass verges are also usable giving better traction) and driveways you The house don't like people using electric chairs as they can damage the carpets; however as long as you can transfer they provide manual chairs.  (The lift is very small so anything bigger would be difficult anyway).  Unfortunately nothing is at entry level so using the lift is the only way to see the house but after that you can go anywhere that everybody else can go.
4544,There is an incline up to the door on the right hand side of the building - no hand rails here. The first door is automatic and the next one on the left hand side is automatic and powered by pushpad. The cafe is down a small decline. The bar is quite high which is a bother for me but staff are great and help. There is a small lift up to the big screen (Cinema 1) and one lift down to two other screens. Note: 2 is up another small lift. Staff are always at hand to assist.
4545,"I go to The Village every time I visit Glasgow now, it is ideal for gigs at the SSE Hydro. I haven’t actually stayed in the hotel but I would definitely choose it if I were to stay in Glasgow. It had fantastic accessibility, helpful and friendly staff, and great food. "
4546,I had a quick look and it seemed okay but neither I or my friend have mobility issues so can't properly comment.
4547,"Excellent wetroom in the bedroom. Plenty of grab rails, lower sink, mirror,  soap dispensers and electric razor points. Large comfortable fold down shower seat"
4548,"staff were lovely, if slow, but didn't seem to understand the problem even when I asked if there was a proper chair available rather than a stool.  "
4549,My wife booked us in for a break after a difficult time. it is a top end hotel with a price to match but we were offered a hoist etc if needed! the staff were very attentive and helpful and you can get everywhere including the pool and jacuzzi. I would not recommend a powerchair in the steam room
4550,"There is one step into the shop, about 4 ins, power assisted Door entrance and exit, on all one level Lino floor, easy access to consultation room via security door to the rear, ample room for power chairs, buggies, seating is also available. The photo hub is at a level for a chair user as is the counter for general counter service."
4551,Very clean 
4552,Led in through the side door. Pass by the disabled toilet and down the left aisle to transfer into a regular seat. My scooter was then taken to the box office and plugged in to recharge. At the interval they checked if I was OK or needed anything. I couldn't access bar or merchandise but they may have helped if I'd been on my own. 
4553,"Staff will deploy a sturdy aluminium ramp if you can get their attention from outside. The entire ground floor is wheelchair-accessible and spacious. The entire basement, which houses the jazz music, can only be reached by a staircase, though if you know what jazz things you want, staff will gladly fetch them for you. "
4554,"The conference center, restaurant and bar are fully accessible.  There is also an accessible toilet with bars located on the main level.  An elevator is located to access the rooms.  Some of the rooms in the hotel have space for wheelchair maneuverability.  Not all rooms are the same size, so it is recommended to ask for the largest room possible.   The doorways to the rooms and bathroom are small (estimated 78cm or a bit smaller), so this may not be an ideal place for people with larger wheelchairs.  If  a person has a small wheelchair and can manage themselves,  this hotel is a possibility.  The bathrooms have no stools or specialized equipment for those with disabilities, but  specialized equipment can be rented from the company Accessible Travel Netherlands in advance.   The entrance to the bathroom varies by room.  Some have a small bump between the room and bathroom on the floor.  Some bathrooms are more accessible than others, so it is important to let the hotel know what your needs are."
4555,Access into the loo is not wide enough for a powerchair to get through the door easily but about to start work to widen doorway and refurbish to a better specification . Standard height loo and one grab rail and again these facilities going to be upgraded imminently.
4556,I was dropped off but there is on street parking and multistory car park close by
4557,easy access no steps  clearly signposted door wide enough
4558,"Ripley Castle is situated in the heart of Ripley Village, it is accessible by car or public transport (number 36 bus running between Leeds and Ripon) and situated approximately 4 miles from Harrogate, North Yorkshire.  In addition to the castle the visitor amenities in the village include a small general shop, tearooms, a pub and restaurant, the Church, a large car park on the outskirts of the village, a small art gallery and two gift shops all within a very pleasant and scenic setting.  The village is level and has a mixture of tarmac and cobblestoned roads and pavements.     Disabled parking spaces (x 3) can be found adjoining the tearooms (opposite the castle entrance) or next to the castle wall a few metres from the entrance (x 3).  The terrain between these spaces and the entrance is level and either tarmac from the tearooms or cobbles from the castle wall – this section of parking also has access via a single lane, quiet road that runs adjacent to the cobbles.  The castle is accessible through the gift shop which has a level, hard surface floor and suitable door widths for wheelchair access.  The merchandise is set out to allow wide aisles between displays and the path through the shop to the castle entrance is not obstructed.  The entrance to the castle is at the back of the shop where there is a disabled toilet with suitable circulation for a wheelchair user.  A four-wheeled motorised scooter is available to reserve (recommended pre-booking) although motorised scooters are not allowed in the castle building, electric wheelchairs are permitted in the castle with prior advice.  A manual wheelchair is available for use during the castle tour.  The surface from the entrance to the castle and terrace is compacted gravel and although a hard surface would be easier this is manageable for wheelchair use.  The gardens are largely accessible with a variety of hard surface paths, signposted, permanent ramps between the terrace and the gardens and double gates with a level threshold between the general grounds and the walled gardens.  The deer park and lake walk is not advised for wheelchair users as the terrain is general parkland/grass fields, undulating and with stone steps leading back up to the terrace. There is no wheelchair access into the hothouses although wheelchair users are able to pass through the hothouse entrance to access the wooded areas of the grounds.  The main entrance to the castle is ramped and fully accessible to wheelchair users, the tour consists of six rooms of which four are on the ground floor.  There is no lift so visitors with limited mobility can watch a DVD that shows the tour information for the upstairs.   Hearing loops are available and can be requested in advance, and visitors with visual impairment are encouraged to handle objects throughout the tour.  The staff are all professional, helpful and welcoming. "
4559,"I purchased a disabled parking bay in advance which was posted out to me prior to my visit,the cost was £12.50 including postage which i thought was a bit on the expensive side but it was well worth i thought when i got there as the parking was only a 30 second walk to the entrance.I cannot really comment on public transport as i didn't use it but the venue is well served by public transport,but is quite along way from the train station."
4560,"Cohens Chemists 5 Somerset Sq, BS48 1RP 01275 852 096 The shop is reasonably accessible throughout. Heavy front door. Entrance 820mm wide. Assistance bell by the entrance. Wide spaces inside. Small consultation room, door 770mm wide. Till 960mm high. Delivery available. No induction hearing loop. Braille on medicines. No toilet. Nearest disabled car park is approximately 200m away.  Review posted by Nailsea Disability Initiative"
4561,Lovely food and a great atmosphere. There was even some live music and accessible! A perfect combination.
4562,"Main building modern. Some doors to shops and café were automatic. As mentioned  most areas were flat, though I noticed there was a slight slope on the path to the farm and activities, which we didn’t visit this time, due to being near closing time. Signage was clear, especially with regards to guidelines re COVID . Floors clearly marked with direction to travel in. Did not observe any alternative format for visitor’s with hearing or visual problems. No seating to stop and rest."
4563,"As with any experience with a high staff ratio, people can be people and some are better than others, but on the whole they all have the right attitude. "
4564,"This fully accessible, stunning building contains many stories and readings for both adults and children. Our purpose on the day of our visit however was lunch. There is charity run café which serves stunning delicious food by friendly and helpful staff. Our food was delivered to the table so we could enjoy comfortably."
4565,"There is only very limited on street parking.  No actual car park. Although it is situated on the corner of the main street in Crossgar, the bus service that passes is not very regular."
4566,First off the disabled access bathroom toilet did not have an emergency cord. The lock on the door was small and fiddlely to use. Not enough grab rails. Shower did have a fold down seat. Floor very slippery when wet. The seat provided was a white plastic patio seat. Every time I stood up I was worried as it did not feel sturdy.
4567,Step free entrance
4568,"Considerate, attentive, friendly, helpful."
4569,Wide entrance doors that are automatic. Plenty of space to move around. There are shopping trolleys and mobility scooters to help disabled people who may want to use them.
4570,"The hotel is modern and wheelchair friendly with very helpful staff, it is, unfortunately at the top of a reasonably steep hill which might prove difficult for manual wheelchair users.   The accessible room is of a good size and the shower room is ok. The actual shower is quite small with only one grab handle next to the shower controls directly opposite the fold down shower seat, which is too far away from the side wall to be able to lean against it for support. The tiles are of an uneven surface so removable grab-handles will not stick.  Breakfast is included and is an excellent buffet arrangement. There is a bar (the back of reception) that serves food but no proper restaurant, which is not a problem as there are plenty of excellent, accessible, restaurants nearby, both at the top of the hill and down in the town centre.   There is no hotel parking but blue badge holders can park on the road around the clock. There is an NCP car park at the bottom of the hill."
4571,Very welcoming and helpful.  The care staff are lovely.
4572,"The accessible toilet I used, which was near the wheelchair-friendly entrance, was huge and perfectly in order in every way - see my picture below."
4573,"Small car park with one disabled space. If you're lucky enough to get that place, then access good. Otherwise a bit of a struggle as limited street parking. Bus stop nearby."
4574,REALY GOOD Access to theatre with 12 wheelchair places.They are  not all in one place so have lots of choice where we sit . Staff well trained to help us. I have been going to this theatre since it opened and I still find it a good and consistent  service. food on site or lots of eating places nearby.
4575,"Main reason this church is accessible is because of the people there. We have had issues with other churches in the past, but everyone here was incredibly welcoming when we visited.  "
4576,"Well, this was rather shocking for Sainsburys as I thought they promoted the sunflower lanyard and helped people with disabilities... more than other supermarkets. This was about the third time i've been to this one and not in a long time... I hate doing reviews like this, it just left me shocked...nearly in tears had to go to the disabled loos to calm. Let me explain, I came into the store with my friend who also wears a sunflower lanyard hidden disabilities and immediately triped over the wet floor signs that were right in the middle of the entrance area.  (My friend had already gone down an isle)... No one asked if I was ok, even the member of Sainsburys staff who was stood doing one of them little taster things, nope nothing... when I warned it might be hazardous she just shrugged and went ok... maybe help with someone who has Autism, ADHD etc! Glad I wasn't using a cane, stick or blind!...   Although they did help when I had to chat to someone regarding something else I couldn't find. Sorry this is such a bad start, other than that the isles were large enough for wheel chairs and minus the good spaced disabled loo being the only one to use for everyone it went ok. Hey, I can't complain at least it wasn't like a previous experience in another supermarket with someone blocking up the disabled loos!"""
4577,"Rod, Peggy and Hannah are amazing people. Friendly, welcoming and will do all they can to make your stay enjoyable. (They even provided us with a small Christmas Tree and decorations one April to enjoy a late Christmas with my parents). If it’s something they can do, they will. "
4578,Staff are generally very helpful 
4579,I've found Pleasance staff to be very helpful and friendly. Everyone I've spoken to has answers to questions and seems to be very familiar with the venue.
4580,"Troon Swimming Pool offers great facilities and accessibility for people with a disability. From the outside of the building, there is clearly marked disabled driving spaces providing lots of space. Next to these, you can see on the left of the building there is a ramp and automatic door creating access to the building. The door is wide enough for wheelchair access and the ramp has a steady, safe incline. Once in the building, you can see disabled toilets and the doors to the gym and swimming pool viewing area have automatic doors at the press of a button. The reception desk is also low enough for anyone on a wheelchair to comfortably talk and interact with people behind the desk. One issue however could be that the doors to the changing rooms, both male and female, do not have automatic doors which could be a problem. This would be in the interest of customer hygiene. In the swimming pool changing rooms there is great disabled changing facilities and shower with lots of space and hoist available on request. There could however, be a tight fit pushing a wheelchair down to the bottom of the changing room as a wooden bench limits access and could cause an issue. In the swimming pool area, there are two chairs available to lower you into both swimming pools. Overall, Troon Swimming Pool offers great access for people with a disability and has friendly staff willing to help at any time!"
4581,Step free from street. Toilet is to the left of the serving  area and left under the Toilets sign.
4582,Staff seemed friendly and happy to help.
4583,"The ground floor was easily accessible. In the back corner is a lift, which is a good size and only has one door, which is easier with an assistance dog. Upstairs was a little narrow in places but still enough space to get around."
4584,A ramp that was not great NO Disabled Toilets.
4585,The staff were terrific. Nothing was too much trouble and they were friendly and helpful throughout our stay.
4586,Lifts to platforms small and always busy so often a queque
4587,A beach with boardwalk access and beach friendly wheelchairs available to borrow for free that your able bodied friend / family member can wheel you down the beach a into the sea. 
4588,"Good accessible toilet and shower. Loads of grab rails. Warm, clean, lovely! It is RADAR locked, so bring your key."
4589,"I visited Showcase VR for my friends little boys birthday so, I didn’t really interact with the staff members myself. I know my friend didn’t find them very friendly or helpful with party arrangements on the day."
4590,Staff utterly fantastic! Fantastic food and great selection of beers. Bar is accessible and there is an accessible loo. There is an accessible cottage in the grounds - very spacious bedroom and great wetroom. There is just one section that is not accessible - the main restaurant - but we used a long portable ramp to combat this. Did I mention that the staff were amazing?
4591,Easy access signed and it was very clean 
4592,2 disabled parking spaces right outside. Normally plenty of parking available in the rest of the car park which is shared with the doctor's surgery and SNAP. Bus stop on Warley Hill accessible but not great as quite a long walk or push to the stop on medium gradiant.
4593,TUI arranged for us to drop of our car at Edinburgh airport.
4594,We got the bus to Glasgow then one to hillhead. Good if you have a concession bus pass. The hillhead sub way is pretty much next to it also. 
4595,The Aquarium is located in the busy seaside town of Skegness. The Aquarium Charges £7 for a person who is disabled and an additional £7 for a Carer.  The aquarium is small and friendly.  I observed a lady using a small mobility scooter during my visit. Parts of the Aquarium have a narrow walkway that at busy times would make it difficult to manoeuvre  a wheelchair or mobility scooter through.  The lighting is quite low and the gentleman who accompanied me struggled to read some of the signs due to this the staff that were located throughout were more than happy to assist by reading out the information. It has not got it's own parking.
4596,"Parking outside lodge,  and disabled parking at hotel and spa"
4597,"There are plenty of parking spaces on nearby roads if you go early on a weekend. However, there is are no allocated accessible parking spaces in the ground and members of the MCC or Middlesex CC take precedence over disabled visitors. The parking you can book via Lords has no specific accessible spaces and is a bit of a trek away. It's also expensive at £26."
4598,Shrewsbury is fortunate to have a great changing station room in the Darwin shopping centre and a privately managed one at ‘Nerdy coffee shop’ which is in Mardol(see my other reviews)  
4599,Not only is it right opposite the station but it also has a car park right outside it with Blue Badge parking.
4600,Brilliant! Nothing was too much trouble. 
4601,"The Metro is fully accessible, though not fully convenient. All stations are step-free, some having lifts, others ramps. At some stations the ramp gradient is too steep to be practical, and many manual wheelchair users will need someone to push them on the upward incline.  There is quite a step up onto the trains, and it took me a long while to learn the exact and brutal manoeuvre needed to 'jump' up this step in my wheelchair.  Signage is very clear. Helpful floor stickers direct you to lifts.   Audio announcements tell you the destination of the train and the next station. A dot-matrix indicator gives the same information in visual form.   Each train has several spacious wheelchair spaces, with wheelchair-symbol stickers by the appropriate doors. There is an alarm button by the wheelchair space, low enough to reach if you were to fall over on the floor.   The division of the Metro system into zones is very poorly documented, the only place you'll find a zonal map is on the ticket machines, and the Zones are sometimes referred to as A/B/C, sometimes as !/2/3 - thoroughly confusing."
4602,Staff were friendly throughout the facilities available. They appeared happy to help their customers and were seen to advice wheelchair users where spaces were available around the food hall and move table and chairs to accommodate space for a wheelchair.
4603,Disabled youth group are ran here  staff have had disability awareness training
4604,"There are RADAR key accessible toilets however the female toilet only has one side drop rail, on the other side there is only one vertical wall mounted rail next to the toilet cistern so there is absolutely nothing to hold you or help you get up on one side. See photo."
4605,Staff are always welcoming and accommodate individual accessibility needs. They move chairs and provide assistance where necessary.
4606,"Staff were ok but we did say that we found the hotel cold especially in the restaurant, bars and lounge area . radiator were not on much at all in these areas ,only one in the restaurant and one in the lounge. "
4607,"Helpful staff at box office (even with Covid-19 there was no need to rebook) and very knowledgeable, helpful volunteer on site."
4608,The front door has steps up the front however to the rear of the property there is ramped access just be careful to slow your powered wheelchair down so you do not wheel off the end of the ramp.  In the property the bathroom and kitchen are next to one another. With wide spaced doors through out the property. The distance from the bathroom to the lounge is about 15 metres so if you use a walking aid at home it would be worth you taking it as there is not rail to lean or rest on along the corridor.  Once you get to the lounge it is very well laid out and you can move around freely. The bedroom is next to the lounge it is very well laid out and quite easy to move around. Although it would be suggested the less able person has the bed next to the door as it is quite tight between second bed and the wall.
4609,"At the moment (December 2016) Luton Airport is undergoing major building work and due to this there are some temporary alterations on the site. The nearest train station is Luton Parkway and from there is a shuttle bus (extra charge) to take you to the airport. As I was travelling alone I decided to arrive by taxi, rather than struggle with the shuttle bus, and the taxi stopped as close as it could to the airport entrance. As part of the upgrade of the airport there are plans to improve public transport access."
4610,Due to the age of the building the main entrance was only accessible by steps. But there was access via the kitchen in the basement which was part of the house. One of the floors has a slightly narrower exit door on the lift so I managed to get in but then couldn't get out at the floor. This was our second visit and although I only saw part of the house I did enjoy it. Photography is allowed without a flash so the floor I was unable to gain access to my husband went up and took photographs for me.
4611,Always lot's of staff around which I'm sure are friendly.
4612,Very friendly. When asked how the food was I said the toast had been a bit burnt and I didn't like the dressing on the poached eggs. The supervisor offered me a free coffee which I didn't want and spoke to the kitchen staff. She told me to say I didn't want any dressing next time.
4613,Very good disabled toilet facilities.
4614,Staff are helpful and knowledgeable.
4615,"Everything is one one level, step-free access with automatic doors. Plenty of space to manoeuvre. There are seats as soon as you come in then a few meters away there is another seating area. There are also seats in the kitchen area. The meeting rooms are all accessible and, depending on the room, seats can need moved if needed. The tables in the conference rooms are a good height and the wheelchair fits under perfectly. The kitchen is wide enough to enter and turn around in. "
4616,"In the city centre, this is well served by public transport. The nearest train station is Waverley, there are also buses.   There is no parking immediately at this venue, and it is a busy tourist area. Disabled parking is available on the surrounding streets. "
4617,Disabled space seems to be abused by people with large car that can't be bother to walk. Better management of this needs to done.
4618,Lots of parking but have to.pay. Security let you in a separate door from crowd and a little earlier. Lift to level.for.seats. All on the flat then. Security put us in space and sear for friend. Good view..Bar at a good height level. All in all was treated well and had good seats 
4619,Dedicated parking but easily walkable if staying in Keswick.
4620,"It’s central London so not easy. We parked about 15 minutes away and I wheeled there, not a problem for me. Might be more difficult for people who walk with mobility difficulties. "
4621,We had parked in a nearby car park so do not know about roadside parking. Sauchiehall Street is one of the
4622,Friendly and helpful. 
4623,"I am unsure about the nearest bus stop to EICC. I was dropped off by a family member in a car (Blue badge holders can park on single yellow lines, drop off where it is accessible.) From the drop off point it was around 10 metres roll to the main entrance. Signage to the centre and entrance was quite poor. I was expecting signs around the streets that told me this is where the vaccination centre was but you could only see NHS banners on the front entrances."
4624,"A lovely and refreshing stop over.  Fully wheelchair accessible with friendly and happy staff.  Reception, bar and restaurant on ground floor with two rooms for disabled people"
4625,"Helpful and friendly, though they have little knowledge of hearing loops."
4626,"Wimbledon Station is very close by and if you're lucky you will get staff to assist you boarding and leaving trains, both National Rail and District Line - it can be a bit random with National Rail, but District Line (like all tube lines) guarantees a turn-up-and-go service. Tramlink runs from this station too and is fully step-free across its whole network. Wimbledon is also very bus-rich."
4627,Fantastic restaurant with wheelchair access
4628,The CP facilities are accessible via two lifts that look like they serve Waitrose. Its a new retail park where everything is on level access. Being Summer 2019 there were lots of deckchairs and seating enticements as well as standard street furniture seating without backs.
4629,"Very friendly and apologetic, but ultimately unhelpful."
4630,"Although the church itself is on a level, padestrianised square, the surrounding streets slope. A taxi should be able to park on the level, close by."
4631,The staff were friendly and delightful- they were most accommodating during my experience.
4632,"The airport is very easy to get around, lots of signage and very wheelchair friendly. "
4633,"Due to this event being central in Dundee, there are plenty of car parks nearby mostly council car parks. Most of the roads right next to Slessor Gardens are closed however, I noticed all of the car parks are still open. When I was organising my tickets I got sent a PDF with accessibility information, including where accessible parking is. I got dropped off though and would recommend you do this too as the car parks are busy.  The train station is right across the road from Slessor Gardens and has a taxi rank beside it. There are also taxi ranks more within the city centre and Dundee bus station is a 10 minute walk away. There are also lots of bus stops on mainly every street where buses visit regularly from all over Dundee and Angus."
4634,"Access is level, however the restaurant is somewhat snug with all the tables and chairs. The staff are lovely and extremely accommodating, but manoeuvring a large power chair would be tricky. "
4635,Toilet was very spacious.
4636,"The signage was clear,  There is a slight slope up from the car park to the entrance the centre was all on the ground floor I could clearly see everything I needed, plus there were people at every stage to help you. I was using a walking frame with a seat, as I have learnt that most places have removed seating during Covid.  I was offered a seat at the reception area, plus instead of winding my way through the roped area for queuing, the ropes were moved so I could take the shortest, most direct route at all stages I was shown the closest booth for vaccination Then on leaving, a staff member check the in route, ensured it was clear and guided me back through the way I came in as it was a shorter route to the car park than the one way system. At the end two lovely volunteers, double checked if I needed the loo, they had just cleaned it down  I didn't see alternative formats, but that doesn't mean they weren't there as the staff helped from the very start and right through the process. "
4637,"A thoughtfully designed interior suitable for a powerchair user with personal needs. The 'cottage' was ramped to gain access but level throughout, also decorated nicely. The garden was accessible with a bench table and seating, a pond and fountain to add interest and sound. While sitting outside we were visited by a lovely cat and family of chickens. We had friends join us and found the kettle couldn't be filled at the same time as the shower was running, which was quirky but not an issue.   Our hosts were delightful, chatted over tea in the garden and helped with things I had forgotten or hadn't thought of.  I am planning a return visit."
4638,Smooth access to venue. Double door by the entrance by Halfords but auto door round the other side. Excellent!
4639,Access to building is via side entrance and rear entrance. You then need to take a lift (fits one wheelchair only). You then enter theatre from behind the stage. Seating available in front row only. Staff very helpful.
4640,"We usually park on the road just round the corner from the venue, where there are spaces or you can park on double yellow lines with a blue badge.  Unfortunately this is a cobbled road :( Some buses go to/from Victoria Street just round the corner.  It's also about a mile from Bristol Temple Meads station."
4641,Didn't see them but I believe the toilets are for everyone
4642,"The entrance to the conference centre is up 2 steps from road level, but there is an albeit narrow, tightly-cornered ramp for wheelchair users which can be difficult to see from certain angles. Once on the pavement it is smooth & level, & the dining furniture on the patio area does not get in the way of access to the conference centre. The reception is accessed through 2 sets of glass manual doors, although the first is usually propped open so only the second has to be contended with. This lobby area is tight & there isn’t much room to manoeuvre. However, once through the reception area has plenty of room & the desk is low enough to comfortably speak to the staff. Inside the conference centre the floors are smooth & level, with plenty of space to move around furniture comfortably. Drinks machines are at standard heights so can be awkward to reach from a wheelchair. There is lift access for rooms on the upper floor; the lift has a heavy manual door that opens outwards, & is a sturdy & spacious platform lift that is speedy, but still requires you to keep hold of the button for the entire time.  The restaurant is accessible with some tables packed closer together which limits movement, & the food is served via buffet which again can be awkward to reach from a wheelchair. However, staff are more than happy to assist in making space between tables & selecting food from the buffet as required. According to their website, a couple of areas at the estate are inaccessible for historical preservation reasons, which is disappointing."
4643,i got a taxi and it was lots of space to load and unload both sides
4644,Staff helpful and friendly
4645,"Some heavy doors but there is a  good, roomy lift and plenty of room at tables."
4646,"The seating was good, as there were chairs as well as pews - so there was choice and reasonably comfortable"
4647,The staff in the normal car park directed us to a disabled parking car park. Staff in the disabled parking area were very infomative & explained I could swap my manual wheelchair for a electric scooter to get around. My husband was very grateful !
4648,Lots of space for chair and carer. ( sorry can’t remember about rails!) 
4649,"My wife and I really enjoyed the food, I had the hot smoked salmon salad and she had the pizza, both were exceptional and the view down the Cromarty Firth was lovely in the sunshine. Unfortunately I had some problems accessing both the main building and the outdoor area as I am a wheelchair user. The main entrance has a raised door sill which sits on top of a raised frame. This caught the footplate on my wheelchair and could had tipped me over. I also observed another wheelchair user having problems at this entrance. When we had ordered our food, the exit to the grassed area had a very thick layer of gravel over it and I got completely stuck. Fortunately I am able to walk short distances so was able to stand while my wife moved my wheelchair. Not all wheelchair users are this fortunate. After I had eaten, I saw one other exit from the main building but this had a step down to the grass and was beyond a closed fire exit. In order to avoid the gravel, I had to wheel across a grassed area to get back to the main entrance. There also appears to be no accessible toilets and parking for only 3 blue badge vehicles. For a building that seems to have been constructed within the last 10 years, I found this hard to understand. There are more spaces allocated to people with dogs instead of disabilities."
4650,"This is a part of and directly adjacent to the old Surgeons Hall and Museum on the upper South Bridge at Hunter Square, Edinburgh. It is on the southbound side opposite the Festival Theatre and the University of Edinburgh. It’s very popular not just because of the area and interests that surround it but the choice of and quality of its food. Everything is prepared and cooked in house, although they are open till 17.00, tray bakes, scones and foods go very, very quickly. The museum is medical and anatomical so not for those under 16 or of a nervous disposition.  Everything is on one level as is access to the Museum and garden. It’s vibrant place during the Festival and is often a fringe venue. As said home produced food on a light lunch basis, choice of 2 soups, salads, baked pots, grains, meats........... just what the Doctor ordered !."
4651,"Walked here, large car park at the front."
4652,"Solihull is a nice little town not far from Stratford apon Avon, and ideal tourist base for Stratford, Warwick castle and Kenilworth castle It’s an up market town with good housing, and pleasant shopping area for those smaller type of shops. Touchwood centre has the usual brands but also a few nice newcomers, we have found some nice little bargains over the years, so well worth going to check out what you can find.   OUR REVIEW We suggest you park in the Touchwood car park as it’s easy enough for your carer, up by a lift, and then all on the level. Park as close as you can to the “Shops” sign (photo 1) and take lift up to shops level (photo 2) which will immediately get you out into the shops (3) and although this is just a typical shopping mall as you see all over the country, Touchwood  is better though as it it nicely laid out with attractive little spots to look at, worth visiting (4) and you simple walk around following the crowds (5) where you will also find places to sit and relax, other malls don’t always provide seating like these. Each store is nicely laid out with attractive window shopping, we like that, it’s free (6) and soon you find yourself out on the pleasant pedestrianised street, wide so you can avoid the crowds pushing past you (7) and along the way you will arrive at the square (8) a small passage will take you to the square with bigger shops, but interesting types, but we have no photo for you as it was raining a little, and we don’t like the wheelchairs seat getting wet, it gets right up my bu…. But if you continue ahead instead, you reach the rather attractive old buildings of Solihull, with smaller shops inviting you in (photo 9) and here, if you have not popped in for a quick drink at the Inn, then turn around and walk back along the shops (10) before going back into Touchwood and return to your car  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS We certainly like it, we go back again and again, we just like Solihull. There are interesting shops, all the usual brand names, it’s always busy with character and well looked after, clean and inviting. You have the choice of being indoors or go outside for a nice bit of fresh air, there are big shops and small intimate shops, places to stop and have a drink, and it’s nice and compact"
4653,Great carpark at Towerhill not very big but we had no problem getting a space & managed to get a blue badge one too. Very reasonably priced for London £2.50/hr. I'd definitely use this carpark again. It is recommended on Tower Bridge website as the nearest one. I called the staff for more details & found them  to be very helpful.
4654,We drove around side streets and were lucky to find a disabled space near the ground.
4655,"Accessible in all areas, interesting, a wildlife haven that is made for both the able bodied and the not able bodied. Not only did we see over 200 wild kites being fed, we saw sparrows, siskins, goldfinches and many other small birds feeding, beautiful flora and forna. The lake had damsel flies in abundance and fish were even jumping. It was a true paradise."
4656,Staff are very friendly and helpful 
4657,Set across one level with no steps.
4658,"Recraigs Lodges provides an excellent alternative to staying in a hotel, being one bedroomed lodges approx 3 miles out of the Aberdeen City in a peaceful spot. Although the website doesn't show this, you can request the suction-type grab rails to use in the bathroom. The whole place is on one level, no steps anywhere, flat to enter and easy to get around in a wheelchair, with wood/ laminate flooring. There is a lounge/ kitchen/dining room, bathroom and one bedroom in each lodge."
4659,They have ramps to the cinema screens which are slightly higher than the others on the left of the cinema. The only trouble I have is the counter tops tills are a tad high for me to be able to use plus all the concession stands either side of the counter tops make it difficult to try to turn around in a mobility scooter to try to get closer to the tills. 
4660,"Very poor, situated in ladies toilet and cannot take a wheelchair and get the door closed."
4661,Lots of disabled parking spaces. Visited at least 30 times - only once had to park in 'regular' parking space.
4662,"Did not interact with the staff much, but when we did they were friendly and helpful"
4663,"Other than at the Parrot show and cafe, we did not really have any interaction with the staff.  Also at thge ticket office.  There are no concessions for carers here"
4664,Very accessible with ramps to the waiting room area and toilets. The ticket office has an induction loop and there is a height adjusted ticket counter available at the station. There is also customer assistance office on platform 2. A ramp for train access is available.
4665,Easy assess from car park outside. Has a disabled room on ground floor with parking right outside for an overnight stay.
4666,My husband and I had a lovely canal holiday  on this well-adapted boat. I am in a wheelchair and we took my manual wheelchair so that we have had more flexibility. We took our dogs to and they had a fun time The Llangollen canal is quite exciting with Tunnels and aqueducts. The canal boat owners were doing extra cleaning because of covid 19 and therefore we felt covid safe The staff explaining how to use the boat were very friendly and very enthusiastic all in all a great holiday.
4667,"The staff were lovely - very helpful and pleasant, and had a good laugh when they had to say some of the naughtier sounding names of the teapot cocktails!"
4668,"Before we visited the Grand Hotel on Eastbourne's seafront we had excellent assistance from the reservations team with regard to our accessibility needs.  This meant that when we arrived, we knew what to expect.  We didn't book an 'accessible' room but one that met our needs.  Arrival:  There are 2 disabled parking spaces near to the access ramp to the hotel.  Parking spaces are reservable, free of charge, for blue badge holders.  There is no low check-in desk, although Guest Services manager sat a lower desk so could check you in there.  No PEEP was completed or information on emergency evacuation.  Everywhere in the hotel is accessible by wheelchair, although there are some heavy doors to negotiate.  Staff in the hotel, however, are extremely helpful and with make sensible suggestions to assist (eg seating us close to the breakfast buffet)  Room:  The room (5) was spacious with a walk in shower (2-3cm step)  There were handrails.  There was plenty of room to manoeuvre the wheelchair.  As this was not designated a 'accessible room' there were no emergency pull cords.  Spa:  Access to the Spa is down in a lift and along a corridor with a heavy door at one end - The step-free route is not signed so we had to ask the way.  There are no disabled changing rooms (that we could see).  The pool has steps in with a handrail (rather than a ladder), but no hoist.  Treatment rooms are through another set of doors, but the Spa therapist accompanies clients here so they can hold doors.  Restaurants / Bars:  Both restaurants and the Bar have step free access and waiter(ess) service.  Throughout our stay, hotel staff were extremely helpful and attentive to our needs"
4669,Reasonable wheelchair access but requires improvement.
4670,"Amazing. They bought drinks to our table, took us to pose for photo opportunities on this historical boat, gave us water for the guide dog. I doubt there's much they wouldn't do to make the Regal Lady as accessible as possible."
4671,"Disabled toilet is good but a little bit small, enough room to move around in a powerchair."
4672,"It has 2 accessible bathrooms and 1 changing place bathroom. All bathrooms are in one area. These 3 bathrooms are separate from the able bodied bathrooms. The separation is well designed. Of the two accessible bathrooms, one has a nappy changing table. I visited the accessible bathrooms only and both were very clean. Nice fresh decor as well "
4673,The CalMac ferry over from Oban seems to be a bit disorganised we arrived at 6 am after a long drive and there were no toilets open until 7:15 at the check-in. The ferry company has done it's best to make the ferry covid-19 safe. The return ferry from the island had a very steep access ramp and I was lucky I had a strong person to push although help was available from the ferry company The parking at the bunkhouse was completely flat and wheelchair accessible
4674,Via the hotel restaurant. 
4675,"All generally unclean, and of the porta cabin variety.  Disabled facilities, shared with baby change so queues, impatient people  a problem.  No disabled changing."
4676,There is no disabled parking but it is located a few seconds from bus stops.
4677,There is a car park and also access is the same as anywhere else in Ambleside. If coming from the village centre you may need to go in the road witha  powerchair due to poor pavements.
4678,"Staff are friendly, access is good and we are able to go onto the ice in a wheelchair. On site changing place nailed it!"
4679,An amazing school with great examples of how accessibility can be achieved.
4680,The toilet was easily accessible but the room only had a bath in the bathroom and no shower for disabled individuals.
4681,"This place was very unexpected. It used to be a working farm so lots of wide flat paths from when tractors etc. would have been using the space. The restaurant was step free, although there was a lip at the entrance, I’ve tried to include a picture to demonstrate this. The farm shop was well stocked without being hard to manoeuvre. Lots of other activities available here, including grass sledging, roller skating, a sand pit and beer and gin tours, but I’m not sure how accessible these activities are."
4682,"There was only one lady on duty, the place was packed on a Friday night. I had asked for a ground floor room as I had a wheelchair as the last time I had stayed at a Premier Inn the bed was far too low. When we got to the bedroom, the bed was really high, the highest bed I have ever seen! I met other clientele who also felt similar. The lady on reception swapped our room for an accessible room, without any problem. She was however so busy, that she never came back with our extra pillow"
4683,The Arriva 26 bus stops near by but you do have to either cross the car park or go down road to get into the centre.  There is a parking space but it is very small.
4684,"clean, accessible, built as a joint venture between the City of Worcester and its University, provides a great space with what I would regard as accessible loos, accessible lifts, helpful staff, banks of computers, photocopying facilities, and Im told they are working to make a lot of the academic texts needed for the students accessible in alternative formats for those who use assistive technology. Theres a room downstairs with video gaming equipment, a lecture/film theatre on site, often has art exhibitions, and the cafe is good, as are the opening hours. If you need to get your radar key or bus pass sorted out, the local city council ""Hub"" for consumers to organise stuff like that is onsite too. Im a chair user at the moment, havent been there myself in a chair, but lots of students here are chairusers  and visually impaired, and it works. it really is accessible."
4685,They are very friendly and helped a couple in front of me by taking them in to the screen to their seats
4686,"Great public transport links, close to tram, bus and Waverley Station. There is also parking available in St Andrews Square and on George Street."
4687,Toilet is fine although tends to be dirty. The challenge is finding it. The route is - head up to the main Bar area (on your right after you come into the Pleasance Dome area). Once at the Bar go through to doors at the right hand side of the bar  and the accessible loo is on your right. It is camouflaged by flyers so can be hard to spot!
4688,"From the car park you can access the loch side paths easily , turn right to head up to the Palace , turn left to head around the loch with great views on to the Palace itself. Some inclines to negotiate but not bad. Some bench seating at intervals around the paths. At the east end of the path wheelchair and scooter access becomes difficult due to a gate and the path surface isn't great but from the car park to this point paths are good and will take you 45 minutes anyway."
4689,"On the flat, plenty of manoeuvring room. Lovely toiletries!"
4690,"Toilets, are wet rooms, with closomat toilets, and adjustable sinks, very spacious and shower chairs available on request."
4691,Staff were very pleasant and friendly. Receiption was very helpful. Breakfast is self service. 
4692,There was a ground floor accessible toilet in the villa. I went in and found it spacious but it did not have any grab rails. I went out again thinking I must have gone in the wrong toilet but when I checked at the receiption desk they seem surprised that I expected an accessible toilet to have grab rails. Sorry I was so annoyed I didn't  go back in to photograph it and I had to wait till I got back to Nice before I could go to the toilet. 
4693,Parking available directly outside property
4694,"There is an ""accessible"" toilet, which has been essentially well-designed. But then the staff have undermined the good design by (i) blocking the transfer area by putting a large rubbish bin in it (ii) tying up the red emergency cord in a complex difficult-to-undo knot on one of the grabrails. This is very thoughtless, silly and dangerous. The red emergency cord must hang freely all the way down to the floor, so that it can be reached by anyone who has fallen over, for example during the often precarious transfer from wheelchair to toilet and back."
4695,"There is a car park at the site. The blue badge parking was at the other side of the car park from the ice rink and we had to leave the car park via the car exit to get to the ramp up into the venue, but as it was a fairly quiet day this wasn't an issue, and there may be a better way of accessing the ramp, we just didn't find it. However, the current car park is temporary as a new car park is being built across the road (as of Jan 2017), so this will hopefully not be an issue for much longer."
4696,Staff friendly and helpful but not in masks.
4697,"The hotel lies on a main road, so it’s easy to drive to, and there are two disabled bays reasonably close to entrance. "
4698,"This place has been on the go for years, from the outset it looks pretty inaccessible and admittedly it has a small step into the ground floor and the toilets down a spiral staircase.  Though as it is my local I know that the staff can be very accommodating. For example you can text your order and they will text you back when it's ready. You can sit outside enjoy your coffee while gazing into my front yard."
4699,"The Inveralmond Brewery is a small independent brewery with over a century's experience of brewing. Try Scottish legends like ""Ossian"" or ""Lia Fail"" or one of their new Inspirations Series.  The friendly ""blethersome brewers""  offer tours of the small modern brewery production area and bar between 10am and 4.30pm Monday to Friday. Costs from £10 per person.  See the website or phone 01738 449448 for more details or to book a tour, the staff will be  happy to help you."
4700,"Parking is on the flat with easy access to the water, either down a wide slipway and onto the wheelie boat through a bow door, or from a floating pontoon.    "
4701,"Very welcoming, knowledgeable, and helpful. Had useful advice for disabled travellers."
4702,Flat access into the building but 2 heavy doors. When we went there was plenty of people around to help
4703,A fully accessible toilet is located inside the entrance of the restaurant
4704,"Two disabled bays reasonable close to main entrance, which had a small step over curb and by door, but easily managed. Once inside hotel, everything on ground floor level was nice and flat, space to get wheelchair around comfortably, with room in bar area and restaurant for chair. The disabled bedroon is down on the lower floor, with a  wheelchair lift right by reception desk, then a pull door to get you into corridor to reach your room. The lovely terrace area has a ramp for you to go and enjoy the sunny warm day, with views over the well looked after grounds, but no ramp to get you down to enjoy the walk across to pool and woodland area."
4705,Disabled parking available that is free of charge.
4706,"For the front entrance there are not automatic doors however the rear view entrance has an automatic door, both are situated on level floor. There is limited accessibility to screen seven due to only having stair access. The lift to the other screens also is not suitable for larger or longer Wheelchairs. However there were two screens on the ground floor which were accessible for Wheelchair users and those with limited availability however these did not have handrails down the aisles.  There is no where where  you can stop and rest from the front entrance to the ground floor screens."
4707,On-street parking a short walk from the harbour.
4708,There is a separate area for blue badge disabled parking. This area is not monitored though and is open to abuse. Whilst at the park I witnessed 3 non-blue badge holders parking in these spaces. This really lets down a very good provision for the disabled.
4709,No chair in bathroom had to use plastic one from room. It would have been difficult if been on own. The bathroom is very spacious though.
4710,"The toilet is to the left of the sink area. It does not have a wheelchair symbol on the door but I found it to be very accessible. There is a pulldown handrail on one side and a horizontal grab rail on the wall. There is a red cord on the left hand side of the toilet as you're sitting, however it does not completely touch the floor. There is space under the sink to roll under and two vertical handrails on either side of the mirror."
4711,The staff were very nice and extremely helpful. My Mobility Scooter fell over on the way traveling back as the van was moving around a lot and staff were good and lifted me back up.
4712,The staff are very warm and friendly. The atmosphere in the cafe is very relaxed and homely. 
4713,Parking is an issue in Blackpool and there are restrictions in places . Most of the large hotels have there own car park if you are staying in Blackpool might be better to leave car  and use trams. The travel card that you can purchase to cover days is also accepted on the bus as well.
4714,"There are plenty of parking spaces with about 4 directly outside of the hotel. Parking is free. There are buses into the centre of Cardiff at Cardiff Bay, including the sightseeing hop on\off bus,  at Cardiff bay, which have wheelchair access. There are also boat trips and a water taxi some of which have wheelchair access."
4715,All toilets are fully functional for all people as none up stairs
4716,Easy ramps
4717,"Despite  numerous assurances to the contrary, the ""disabled facilities"" at this venue are laughable.  Amenities for the able bodied are adequate but since January' 'big  move' from BT Murrayfield disabled supporters seem to have become an afterthought! It's all very well 'bigging up' Myreside but get your infrastructure sorted out first!"
4718,Very friendly and inclusive- there purely to help out and passionate. Most are volunteers.
4719,Totally accessible  toilets in all flats in an enormous bathroom. Lots of room for hoists etc.
4720,"Very polite staff, seemed happy to help."
4721,"Free loan of mobility scooters, wheelchairs, walkers etc."
4722,"The whole area is designed round the ability of wheelchair users, to move about very easily. No steps, small ramps to get over any lips. Cottages adapted for wheel user who still want independence, with the kitchens with lower sinks and work tops."
4723,Not too far from the bus station however the closest parking intended for blue badge holders is normally always full and it is not very close to the car parks.
4724,Entrance to the warehouse is okay you have to need someone else to open the door for you. You'll need to use the other entrance to get inside as there is a step to get there. To get to the climbing area you have to go in a lift you will only be able to get one will chair in at a time as sore as it is a small lift. When you get to the climbing area there the staff will get you a ramp to get to the climbing area.
4725,"Disabled parking across the road, multi-storey car park at the end of the road."
4726,Lodge has a wet room with grab rails at loo. Access is via carpeted bedroom. We managed transfers with a sara stedy despite the carpet. 
4727,"Access was very good, minus the need to open some fairly heavy doors.   The first set of doors at the entrance are automated but the second, which come just after the first strangely aren't.  Staff were, however happy to help if they can see you. Step free access into the venue. There is a large lift up to the function rooms upstairs."
4728,"First obstacles to access are the step into the garden and small uneven step at the door. It's tight for space inside with barstools everywhere and lots of corners to negotiate - not surprising given the old building. However staff were quick to come to my aid, unbidden. There's a disabled loo - small and packed with loads of stuff that shouldn't be in there!  Food divine, service efficient, prices reasonable, surroundings lovely."
4729,"Not many blue badge spaces, but it's a very big car park and usually plenty of room and blue badge parking is free anywhere not just in the marked bays."
4730,"If the staff hadn't been so negligent about the conditions in the accessible toilet and about blocking the way to the mezzanine platform lift, I would have awarded five stars, because all the staff I encountered were sweetly helpful and friendly. But I've knocked off three stars and I'll restore them if only I find on a subsequent visit that *all* the toilet issues have been fixed."
4731,"We visited this cottage for a week in April, taking a young boy in a wheelchair with quadriplegic cerebral palsy, as well as an 85 yr old granny with mobility problems and three other special needs children (with no mobility problems)! The cottage was provided with everything we needed and the owner met us on our arrival to show us around. There were plenty of bedrooms to accommodate us all, all furnished to a high spec and some bedrooms with ensuite so granny could have her own walk in shower. Along with central heating  there is a wood burner in the lounge to keep you warm,  but make sure you use dried wood as the bag of logs from the local garage was damp and didn't light easily or give off much heat, so a quick search of a DIY shop in Swansea produced  some lovely dry logs which made all the difference. The lounge was a little on the small side for the number of us, but there was an electric recliner armchair which granny enjoyed using. Kitchen is well equipped and spacious. The garage contained beach access equipment but you would need to discuss  use/hire with the owner.  The garden is lovely with a stream running through it and also through a goldfish pond. There are lights all around it for evening use. Plenty of seating and space to watch wildlife and birds feeding at the bird table. The driveway has a small slope up to the garage but this wasn't a problem for us.  We took our large dog, he slept in the garage, and there are fields and beaches nearby for walks The location is a quiet country road near to Rhossili village and famous beach.  The bedroom for our young boy was well equipped with hoist straight into the ensuite bathroom. Only minor gripe would be that we had to change him on the bed after hoisting him from the bath, so we had to put down protective sheets to stop the bedding getting wet. The hospital bed worked fine and he slept well. Although the weather was cold we enjoyed our stay, it worked well for our large family and different needs and hope to return again.  Recommended !"
4732,"I was very disappointed on my visit today to Warwick Castle.  Firstly the lack of signage for the disabled parking got us off to a bad start and then the bays were hardly big enough to be classed disabled. The courtyard disabled toilet was a joke unless you were an octopus.  Trying to open the door, keep it open and control my mobility scooter was an art and coming out was even worse.  Thank God for helpful visitors to the ladies toilet opposite who held the door open for me. Access to most of the Castle is up (or down steps) so impossible.  The only area you can access is the Great Hall and I would say thank you to the shop and Hall staff who were very friendly and got me on and off the lift. The booklet says The Conservatory is wheelchair friendly but you struggle to find the way in, again signage is very poor!   The choice of food was poor and expensive no hot food and a choice of about 4 sandwiches. The trail to the River Island to watch the jousting was a no go one way over and so steep.  So I missed that one. All in all I felt my visit was not worth the money and I would like Warwick Castle management to go round their areas in a wheelchair for a day!!"
4733,We drove to Barn at Beal. There is a good sized carpark with several disabled parking bays which are situated just beside the ramp to access the building. 
4734,Excellent disabled access with an accessible ground floor toilet and an accessible on street entrance to the building as well. 
4735,It was fairly easy to find but far away from the main rooms
4736,If you are only visiting the restaurant the unisex disabled loo is within the ladies powder room. It is excellent for ambulant wheelchair users or manual wheelchair users. Unfortunately the entrance is too narrow for power chair users.
4737,Radar key system (they only have one key) good bathroom with expected bars etc. on the time of visit no cleaning equipment was using the toilet as a store cupboard.
4738,Staff were very helpful. Even down to explaining the accessibility features of some of the furniture!
4739,"We spent a long weekend here, and received the warmest of welcomes. I have MS, and so does the site owners daughter. It has given them a unique insight into the disabled world, and they strive to be the very best they can. For 2020 the washrooms have been updated and I can’t wait to visit in the summer and try them out. "
4740,"Perfect slopes, wide doors, lifts to all floors"
4741,"Our overall experience was seriously good , mainly because of the location of wheelchair seats and an easy access all way round the stadium with quite handy placed food and hot drink kiosk round the corner."
4742,James St is a Metro link as a result as well as the station there are a number of local buses that stop outside or near to the hotel. There is also a Taxi rank at the door and all of the Taxi we used could take a wheelchair so no need to book one as there was normal 3 in the rank. There is no on street parking due to the number of buses etc in the area
4743,Level access but gravel surface on paths make moving wheelchairs difficult in some areas. There is a tractor with a trailer adapted to take wheelchairs around the venue. Restaurant is wheelchair accessible with ramps to main restaurant and disabled toilets. Advice is given on entry that there is an alternative entrance to the Township for disabled visitors.
4744,All staff seemed to be approachable and willing to help when asked any questions. 
4745,On on one levl.
4746,"A fantastic museum with lots to see. Nice  spacious building. As you enter the museum there is a very nice platform lift to take you to the reception area. Once in, there is plenty space, lifts are a good size and the exhibits and information are at a good height for wheelchairs. For people with visual impairments there are large print versions of the text for the exhibits. The accessible toilets were a good size."
4747,"As mentioned in the main review the access is excellent . The only downsides I can see are the length of the ramp - not a problem for scooters/wheelchairs but could be a problem for people who can walk but with difficulty, and the heaviness of the doors which need a bit of height and a strong arm!"
4748,"We use a wheelchair and the wide flat paths are excellent. Several different paths so you don't have to take the same route every time you go. The Helix connects with the Kelpies so how much you do and how far you go can be varied. Car parking is good, especially now the first car park has a better surface, but not enough disabled spaces. Accessible Toilets and cafes at the Lagoon and at the Kelpies visitor centre (although the cafe at the Lagoon is seasonal opening).  Only 2 real downsides for us: 1) access to the canal towpath is really steep and whilst just about possible with a lot of huffing and puffing by the pusher, it's not really that accessible which is a real shame as the canal path itself is great; 2) no chance to hire a mobility scooter which would be a real bonus. Very dog friendly."
4749,"The disabled parking is very good, as they have 6 spaces"
4750,There is only off street parking and it is usually hard to find a space. There are many bus stops near the venue.
4751,Staff are very friendly and helpful.
4752,Limited amount of accessible spaces considering the size of the Car park. Spaces directly at the front door. There is a good bus service that passes 2 min walk from the entrance.
4753,"Good clean facility in convenient location for shops and carpark. Quick response from attendant via the intercom to let us in as we didn't have a RADAR key. The shopping centre website says that the table is height-adjustable, but it didn't look like it was and no instructions were provided for how to use it. There was enough room for 2 carers and a wheelchair without having to squeeze round the wheelchair.  Size of room was approx 2.2mx2.6m"
4754,The Pier is about half a mile from Eastbourne railway station. There are local buses that stop outside.
4755,Coastguards on site.
4756,There are 6 spaces available and very clearly marked  these were empty during or visit there are mother and child spaces next to them. The local bus services between Coatbridge and Airdrie all stop near the store however it is a busy road to get across at peek times
4757,"Clean and warm. There is a red alarm cord and it was at floor level when we visited. There's room to park a wheelchair at one side of the toilet if a side transfer is called for. There are grab rails by the loo and the wash basin. The only reason we aren't giving this five stars is that the hand-dryer is on the opposite wall to the wash basin, and there are no grab rails anywhere near it. Can't think why they didn't put the hand-dryer next to the wash basin and its grab rails."
4758,"2 disabled parking bays next to front door- fantastic. Great as long as you aren't the third disabled visitor, but there appeared to be some more parking not too far away (not sure of any of these were disabled width though, you might need to ring and check)."
4759,"A group of us from MindforYou met here for lunch.  There were three elderly dementia guests with their carers and three staff.  One guest had a wheelchair and the disabled access was very good and the staff were very accommodating.   We booked a table in advance as we were a group of nine and it was a good job we did as it was extremely busy in the restaurant!  Perhaps it was because it was a Monday as the queue to get food was very long and we had to wait quite a long time.  However the food was lovely, although a little pricey and after lunch we walked around the garden centre.  There is a huge selection of plants, trees, fruit and vegetables to admire and indoors there is a lovely selection of homeware, gifts, clothes etc.  So easy to spend a fortune!   The only down side were the toilets which were not in the restaurant and were outside.  As we had one guest in a wheelchair, this proved quite time consuming.  There is disabled car parking right next to the garden centre but with only with limited spaces.  We weren't able to get one of these unfortunately so had to park in the outer car park which was harder work pushing the wheelchair.  Other than that we had a lovely time here and will definitely visit again."
4760,There was a ramp to get in the restaurant but inside the restaurant it is very difficult for a mobility scooter to move about the tables.
4761,really good both in public areas and in the rooms.Automatic doors to reception and our hotel block. Dining room and bar accessed by lift which worked well.
4762,There is adequate parking to the front of the property with a compacted stone/gravel drive way which is suitable for a wheelchair to move across. There is ample space for turning / reversing a large vehicle i.e. Volkswagen Caravels.
4763,Disappointed to have to move a chair out of the way  that was blocking the doorway to the accessible loo I visited. The toilet was accessed using a RADAR key. It was not particualrly spacious and could be difficult if you had a carer. It wasn't the cleanest of loos I'd seen either.
4764,"No trouble getting around, staff very helpfull."
4765,"Plenty of parking, great cafe, good loos and loads of sport thrown in!"
4766,There is a small lip at the front access to negotiate. 4-5cm. Staff friendly and would be happy to help if this posed a problem for a wheelchair user. My daughter is a manual wheelchair user and would probably have managed it herself although we helped her on this occasion as she is new to her wheelchair. Shouldn't pose a problem for motorised wheelchair. Plenty space in restaurant/cafe for manoeuvring. 
4767,No specific parking but there are disabled bays in town. Check the Council website. You can park in residents' only spaces if you have a blue badge. It is right next to some bus stops.
4768,Very good.
4769,Really great place really accessible had a great time with my friends from get2gether would recommend it to anyone. 
4770,Spacious and open. Drink franchises well serviced with tables. 
4771,Always very friendly and helpful.
4772,There is an accessible toilet but only 3.5 stars as there are often a lot of high chair stacked next to the toilet which I find difficult to negotiate. On one occasion a member of staff offered to move them all for me but I still find this very irritating !
4773,"A council car park with disabled spaces is a few buildings down, as well as other car parks/on street parking close by and taxi rank is also nearby. There are also plenty of buses that pass through Broughty Ferry on regular basis. A train station is also situated in Broughty Ferry although I don’t know anything about how often they stop, I know it’s not that much though."
4774,There is flat ground up to the pay booths after that again there is a rough patch of ground that’s all stony and very hard for myself with back/spinal pain to go over it as it shakes my mobility scooter to pieces. 
4775,This is based on the current takeaway service which does not require you to enter the cafe. You order your food and drink from one window and collect it from the other. The windows are open from approximately 3 feet off the ground so easy to reach your items and pay. Their food is on display in the window so easy to see what is on offer. 
4776,"On arrival the hotel has a ramped entrance to the right the main entrance. A large automatic sliding door opens on a sensor to let you into the spacious foyer. There are self service check in machines as well as an attended desk. Two large and spacious ( I could turn around in my powerchair) lifts go to the upper floors. Off the main foyer is the lounge, bar and dining area.  Going up to my accessible room I came out of the lift, went through one door and then my room was there. Unlocking the door I found the room to be the spacious with plenty of wheelchair space either side of the large bed, room to sit along side the armchair, lowered surfaces and hanging space. The bathroom was a large wet room with plenty of turning space, grab rails, lowered surfaces and a shower area. The lighting was good and everything spotlessly clean.  Going to dinner and later breakfast in the dining room was easy. open level access to the table of my choice. Furniture was quietly moved to enable me to get close to the table. The staff were very attentive and we enjoyed our meals. In the morning we sat close to the buffet area and it was easy to wheel over and se what I wanted for breakfast."
4777,Super kind and knowledgeable. Can go out on the water with you if you need them to.
4778,Accessible leaflet given detailing which parts were accessible for varying degrees of disabilities.
4779,Absolutely brilliant. Very cheerful - always smiling - genuinely happy to help.
4780,A minor lip to get over. But otherwise easy access and the building is basically ramped appropriately to gain access to the buildings floor.
4781,"The restaurant is on the third floor. The store and restaurant are fully accessible and there are lots of lifts.  Staff are friendly and helpful  are there is an accessible toilet on the same floor very close to the restaurant. However, I was alone and there is a long walk between where the food is served, where drinks are served, where the till is and where the tables are. I'm sure staff would have carried a tray for me if I had asked but I parked my scooter by a table and walked back to get my food and drink. I was very tired after that. Lovely food, though, and good value."
4782,Can't fault the staff. Very friendly & very willing to help.
4783,Disabled parking at the rear was great and yards from the disabled entrance. The hotel sits on top of a hill though so walking/pushing to it from public transport could be troublesome!!
4784,no disability access part from dinning room
4785,"Very helpful and friendly staff, they couldn't do enough for us"
4786,"Street parking, close to bus station and train station."
4787,"Access to all parts is easy enough here, even for a large power chair, as there is plenty of space provided for disabled person to feel confident about. Being almost level everywhere, ( we did notice there is a second floor small area, ) and nicely laid out with floor tiles or a good concrete floor, you have no worries about bumping into shelves, and we saw everything we wanted to look at or buy."
4788,The staff were very friendly and helpful
4789,"All very helpful and friendly.  They ensured I had space to move, showed me to the first vaccination booth, and on the way out directed me with support through the shortest way."
4790,"Very helpful with seat finding, programmes and refreshments."
4791,"Access in and around the building:  Finding the building was tricky but I was fortunate in having a companion to help me. I’m told you see the building easier if you are on the opposite side of the road.  Once inside the reception desk is directly in front of you. I was quick to be asked if I required assistance.  Getting around the hotel was good with wide and clearly indicated corridors.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible rooms I visited were both great as they were bright and light. The dual aspect windows made the light levels higher than what you often encounter in hotels. The accessible bathrooms were well lit, laid out and easy to navigate.  Access in the dining area:  The dining room was in another part of the hotel and involved a journey from one building across the link section to another. Once I had seen where you go it was fine.  Access to other facilities:  The hotel bar is next to the dining room and had plenty of places to sit and relax."
4792,"All access is through 2 sets of  wooden doors which are not automatic , the entrance is level and this leads into cafe where you also pay to enter gardens. There are maps available to explain the areas that are accessible.  On my visit i asked about any other disabled access and was told by staff that if you where to enter the Gardens from the park and ride, the access gate sometimes does not work. This would mean going back to the car and driving to the entrance by Collingwood college."
4793,I ate outside and didn't go into the restaurant. The outside seating was at street level and therefore step free. There were plenty of free standing table and chairs.
4794,"Brilliant staff , beautiful scenery and wildlife and accessible for all ages and disabilities"
4795,The staff were all so helpful
4796,Part of the Edinburgh network of cycle and walking paths on disused railways lines. Only falls short of five stars because there are some places where it is not possible to exit the path in a wheelchair because of steps.
4797,"There is a fairly large car park, although there are relatively few blue badge spaces. However it is all level, with tarmac, and it would be possible to drop someone off near the toilets/cafe."
4798,"Friendly staff, excellent food. This restaurant is quite small but I still managed to fit in in my powerchair. I’m always on a quest for great food and this place delivers. Delicious! Which makes up for the lack of accessible toilet."
4799,"The nearest step-free station is Highbury and Islington, London Overground only. The tube part of this station (Victoria Line) is not step-free. There are no other step-free stations nearby. Many bus routes go past this café. I would not try to park in this area."
4800,"I didn't use them during my visit, but they almost certainly lack full changing facilities, and probably had to make the most of a small space."
4801,"The venue staff were very rude to one of our PAs when she arrived early to check out the access, but the security staff were later very helpful when it turned out that the Box Office had given our party (5 wheelchair users plus 2 PAs) the wrong tickets."
4802,Large accessible loo with 4 grab rails and an emergency cord
4803,Staff were really nice and the service was good. I was surprised to see no staff members were wearing face coverings or masks as I have seen staff doing this elsewhere. 
4804,"The bathroom in the accessible room was ideal. There was a low-sided bath. But I did need help with the toilet rail - it was a little too heavy to move into 'down' position, but no problem when I asked receptionist (Keeley). Reception was very close-by."
4805,"Going there by a car, there are parking spots for wheelchair users and I believe the nearest bus stop is no more than 10 minutes walk."
4806,"In there larger building, on the ground floor in the first room just behind the stairs there was the entrance to the toilets. Once going through the door there was a sink and 2 toilets cubicles, both had an accessible toilet with single grab rail, small sink, spacious but no emergency cord.   There were no toilets in the smaller building of the museum."
4807,"Spacious fine gravel path, mostly flat and no steep inclines especially if you do the loop clockwise. Marker posts with white rings at regular intervals to show the way."
4808,"It would be five stars but for the occasional driver who didn't ""curtsey"" the bus to enable me to back the manual wheelchair off without using the ramp and for the occasional fellow passengers who didn't vacate the wheelchair spaces. Bus stops are clearly labeled and provide clear information about timetables and routes."
4809,Staff are always friendly when approached and will assist when able.
4810,"Access its brilliant. There is quite a long and gradual wooden decking type ramp up to the main door.  The door itself needs to be manually pushed open but to be fair, in the summer its nearly always propped open and even if its closed, there are plenty of people going in and out and someone will always hold the door for you so again no real issues there."
4811,The Mayflower have no parking but there is a reasonable amount of parking very close to the theatre.  It is on a busy bus route and is just 5 minutes easy walk from Southampton train station.
4812,"There are bus stops on the nearby Royal Mile and one just outside of the shop, but otherwise parking and transport isn't the easiest in this part of Old Town. There is more on street parking on Holyrood Road around the corner."
4813,"Fully assessable, no fuss made, just made provision for wheelchair without needing to be asked. Excellent customer service minor mistake rectified immediately."
4814,Level access accessible toilet friendly people 
4815,Council car parks with blue badge spaces - one  across road and one about 200 yards away.  Can be dropped off near door.  Bus stops nearby.
4816,The access for disabled people at Cheltenham racecourses is excellent there is a lot of space for disabled users to move around. In one of the rooms they have the bar has a lowered part where disabled users can use. I had to lifts which are small but easy to use
4817,"Small family owned business offering food and cultural tours in Corfu. I booked a private food walking tour and loved it. Highly recommend. If you go to Corfu just book it, you won't be disappointed."
4818,"Always very helpful and polite. Somebody  in the queue was insisted that they did not want the headsets, the staff member was very patient and friendly, explaining why it was not a typical exhibition and it would not make sense if you did not have them on."
4819,Allocated disabled parking spaces right outside the entrance. Multiple bus links going to Ocean Terminal which is over the road.
4820,"The nearest tube station South Kensington is not step free. Although the Piccadilly, District and Circle line stop there all the platforms involve steps to the ticket office hall level and then further steps to street level. This is really disappointing. There are a number of buses that stop outside or near to the V and A. I would suggest picking up bus no 14 from Green Park which is an step free station. I arrived in a taxi from Victoria with some of my group, as out of the group of 12 - 14 friends, 3 of us had mobility disabilities."
4821,The venue has very good disability parking well marked plenty of space as I drive myself there with a large Mercedes Sprinter van. It is also on a bus route as I know other friends go there with wheelchairs on the bus.
4822,"A great stay. Comfy bed, huge wet room with 2 red cords. 2 lifts down to entrance and automatic doors outside. Low level reception desk. Ideal. "
4823,We had to park quite a distance away which meant walk through busy crowds which I found difficult due to sensory issues.
4824,"This place has just undergone a big renovation and is looking ace! We visited on a busy Thursday night and really enjoyed the buzzing atmosphere, drinks menu and the bar food menu."
4825,"Close to La Rambla where there are lots of buses and Metro stops. Parking isn't great, and the street El Cafeto is on is a narrow pedestrianised street."
4826,"There was some confusion with staff telling us the wrong information about disabled parking and trying to seat us in a completely different section to what was on our ticket and what we paid for, but it got sorted. The amazing access and incredible show by The 1975 more than made up for the confusion."
4827,All of the staff were very friendly and helpful in all the areas of the venue and were doing there very best to help people in anyway the could.
4828,Ace wee coffee shop with level access and great staff. 
4829,Slightly small for my powerchair & PA to fit but we managed. The toilet was key locked so could only be used by people with a radar key & it was clean.
4830,Seemed to be helpful and cheerful - didn't need any specific help.
4831,There didn't seem to care that it was so hard
4832,I can't comment the staff enough. They made me feel very supportive at each step of the travel through the airport. 
4833,There are buses that pass by the door but i am unsure which service is provided as we arrived by foot. I could not see any accessible parking.
4834,"I have visited Three Abbey Green on numerous occasions over the last 5 years with my family. We always receive a lovely warm welcome and can't imagine staying anywhere else. We have stayed in several of the available rooms, mostly Lady Hamilton and the Westwood Suite, both of which are on the ground floor  The Westwood Suite is large, with twin beds available and an additional single bed in adjoining room. Very accessible, the large bathroom has at wet room type walk in shower with drop down seat and  hand rails. The Bath has two hand rails either side of the bath, plus a larger rail to assist anyone with reduced mobility to have confidence to step into the Bath.  The toilet is raised with an unobtrusive pull down rail  There is always a wonderful selection at breakfast and everything is freshly cooked local produce.  The homemade jams and marmalades are amazing!  The location is very central in a small cobbled square in the heart of Bath  I have already booked our next stay!"
4835,We came in a minibus and it was easy to park
4836,Getting in and around the pub was fine. The door is a little narrow but I got my chair in fine with my assistance dog walking backwards in front of me. The pub and restaurant are on split levels and there is a step but I think you can get between them by going outside via the beer garden. They also said they have a portable ramp but I hate those things!   The pub has dog friendly areas but it was Liggy's (my assistance dog) first time back in this kind of environment and I asked if we could sit away from other dogs to ensure she wasn't distracted. They were fine with that and moved chairs so we could fit in comfortably.   The pub was quite quiet and felt safe.
4837,"The car park was next to the station, all depends where your parked you could have a bit of a walk, but there is a wheelchair at the station you could have use of"
4838,Wide doors for disabled access and always helpful staff there to assist.
4839,"The toilets I used were next to the food court. They were spacious,  clean and had everything I needed. I have marked them as a 4 star, because I feel like they have missed the opportunity to install a changing places loo in such a large space."
4840,"We are silver members of Castle Howard and booked to visit for the first day of their 2021 Christmas experience. Each year has a different theme and this year, it's Narnia. The house and gardens are largely wheelchair accessible but there are some hilly sections outside and a variety of surfaces."
4841,"Decent selection of buses from Lothian Rd, about a 3 minute walk from the Usher Hall."
4842,Twin ramps to front of town hall with electronic controlled doors Accessible Toilets on Ground floor with good access to main Hall
4843,"We had a lovely visit to the Bluebell in Helpston near Peterborough. Our son is a powered wheelchair user and all of the bedrooms were wheelchair accessible, with a little reorganisation, with one larger twin room with a bigger wet room particularly designated as such. The pub itself is also accessible and the staff were friendly and went out of their way to assist us. Added bonuses are that this is a very attractive area and the food at the Bluebell is really good and reasonably priced."
4844,"Small, intimate theatre with 2 stages and café/ bar. Located in Finsbury Park, North London. "
4845,"toilets are downstairs, not accessible but good for hidden disabilities"
4846,"The staff were 5 star. I was greeted at the door by a member of staff who showed me to the reception, the receptionist was really nice and all the guides at each floor were all helpful and acted like they were genuinely proud of Duff House, the member of staff at the coffee shop was also nice. "
4847,There is a Pay and display car park right outside the museum with 4 disabled parking spaces. The last time I went here the disabled spaces were all taken up so I had to park in a normal space. It would be useful if there were some more spaces.
4848,I used the toilet on the upper floor where the drinks reception was held. The accessible toilet was spacious and clean with grab rails. The emergency cord was wrapped around the grab rail and I untied it.
4849,"The car park is close by to the entrance, with disabled spaces at the closest end to the entrance, with only a short walk between the car park and the entrance."
4850,"I have been going to Lochanhully and unfortunately this will be my last time as my Granny and Granda are no longer going. So this time I stayed for the weekend and it was lovely. With Landmark Forest Adventure Park near to Lochanhully, it is an ideal place for families to stay! Excellent food from  Jake's Bar and Restaurant and good service."
4851,"The Wednesday Evening session was very well attend with over forty visitors, people with a wide variety of special needs and their families. The BLS volunteers greeted my family making us very welcome. The four of us were fitted with life vests and we were asked what type of boat we wanted to go on, we opted for one of  the Hawk keel boats, six man sailing boats, two volunteers sailing and four passengers. It was a beautiful evening and a wonderful hour of sailing.  There were lots of volunteers on hand, who were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Each had a role, from meeting and greeting, registering, guiding to pontoon and boat crews.   BLS facilities are very good, there is seating around picnic tables and tea/coffee available if you have to wait. The BLS cabin is beside the Carrickfergus Sailing Club clubhouse which has full facilities and access.  The parking at BLS is very good, plenty of space and close to the cabin, marina and harbour."
4852,"Superb staff, more than once  greeted with a cheery smile and 'hello'"
4853,Disable parking next to the visitor centre
4854,There was a lot of disabled parking
4855,Very helpful and knowledgeable about the Park and the future plans for redeveloping it - there are 3 old buildings in the Park that require significant levels of TLC but the Park staff are working on this - a local charity Fife Employment Access Trust is leading on this
4856,"Broadwood Farm offers superb access and has plenty of seating for wheelchair users, there are two sections of seating that have steps to access them but this is not a major issue as there is plenty of other seating throughout and the staff will happily rearrange seating if needed."
4857,On this occasion I drove there by car. There is a public carpark located behind the shops on the High Street however there are specific disabled parking spaces to allow disabled people to park directly on the High Street despite the street itself being pedestrianised.
4858,"They have a large car park,  and we booked berths on the ferry. Brittany Ferries cater very well for disabled access"
4859,There are 2 large open access toilets near the front of the centre that are very spacious and fully equipped
4860,"An accessible loo is located in the visitor centre - not the easiest to manoeuvre into to with ninety degree turns but functional, clean and bright."
4861,Perfect for our needs.
4862,As the rained poured onto a bustling Princes Street I looked for somewhere to take cover. Seeing a sign proclaiming accessible entrance I wheeled in that general direction to find it was the National Gallery.
4863,"Low thresholds and wide doorways, plenty of space to get around. There is a double and twin and bathroom downstairs plus two further bedrooms and a bathroom and toilet upstairs. The double room can also be configured as a twin. We had it as a double and there was plenty of space to access it from either side. A commode/shower chair can be borrowed if required. There is more information about accessibility features on the owners' website."
4864,"Great singing, good sightlines and a real bargain for the wheelchair user and her accompanist - the tickets (rear stalls) were €4 each."
4865,There are two here an external one and one at the cafe. The external one however even if you have a radar key can't be accessed unless you go to find a member of staff to unlock the extra lock at the top of the door! I have told them that this causes a problem because you cannot simply access it without finding staff to help you. They said that they were afraid it would be vandalised without extra security! So I would recommend using the one at the cafe. Other than this Heartlands is a good place to go. Just make sure you have cash as some of the shops don't have chip and pin machines. Nearest cash point is at Tesco Extra in Pool just up the road.
4866,"Can't comment on the parking. Our tram got us to within seven minutes of the Volksoper, and it was an uphill push. Trams 40, 41 & 42 get you from Schottenring, on the edge of the city centre, to a stop a couple of minutes from the Volksoper. There is a U Bahn station (Währingerstraße-Volksoper) just across the road from the Volksoper. It's on Line U6."
4867,"There is a wheelchair accessible door at the main entrance (it's just to the right of the revolving door). There are lifts which will take you to whichever level your movie is screening. I believe there are 6 levels in this cinema. Our movie was on level 3. The food and drink counters aren't very wheelchair accessible as there aren't any lowered sections, but I'm sure the staff would be happy to help if needed.   The screen we were in had the wheelchair accessible spaces at the front, which can be a little annoying and too close to the actual movie screen. I could feel my neck straining as I was watching the movie and I believe some other wheelchair users could struggle with this especially if they have limited movement in their neck/back. It would be great if the wheelchair spaces were positioned a little further back or at the back of the room like in other cinemas.  Otherwise, access is very good at this cinema and I didn't have any problems moving around in my wheelchair."
4868,Extremely helpful
4869,"There were staff members on the ground floor, one approached me to see if I needed any help or directions."
4870,The most convenient way to access dunelm is by car however if you use public transport it is harder to access although there is a positive for using public transport as there is a bus stop 2 minutes down the road.  
4871,"The revolving door to the reception area has a wheelchair button which enables wheelchair users to slow the door down - great idea. The circulating spaces in the hotel are generous, there are four capacious lifts - we never had to wait for long - and the accessible bedrooms are spacious and well-designed. Lighting can be controlled by bedside switches &, there was an alarm cord by the bedhead of the twin bed nearest to the accessible bathroom."
4872,Excellent and very friendly! They make sure the facilities are extremely clean. 
4873,Scotts restaurant has recently opened at the Port Edgar marina. It is the first Scott’s restaurant to open on the east coast and it has amazing views of the three bridges and Firth of Forth. The restaurant is wheelchair accessible. It can be accessed by stairs or a lift.(see photo). The entrance doors are wide and can be electronically opened by the push of a button. The restaurant is open throughout the day serving food and drink. We went for an early dinner. The food was great and the staff were friendly and extremely accommodating. The restaurant is spacious and has both booths with round and long rectangular tables which are suitable for wheelchair users to sit at. There is a disabled toilet (see photo). There is also a car park that that is very close and has disabled bays. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
4874,"Level and very smooth access, plenty of shops, disabled toilets, lifts. Always clean.  Can be  a little busy at weekends. Plenty of places to eat. Feels safe to shop. Long opening hours. Would recommend."
4875,Easy for us as we came on the 124 bus which stops on Lothian Road - then it is a 10 min walk / wheel to Lauriston Place. Edinburgh being Edinburgh there are some hills to navigate! There are other buses though that do stop on Lauriston Place itself which would be even more convenient!
4876,Ground floor has no steps Cafe is easily accessible with a lift to the first floor of the Museum.
4877,Lots of seating in the reception and social area directly at the entrance. Everything is very clearly signed and the lift is also directly at the main entrance.
4878,Approaching the building you see that it has a stepped frontage. Closer examination revealed a ramp section of pavement to the side.
4879,"The bus driver folded out a ramp. Plenty of room to drive my Go-Go Sport on and park in the disabled space. My scooter is 44inches, there was still room for a standard wheelchair to sit besid it. "
4880,Couldn't have been more helpful.
4881,We got here by taxi - it would be a bit of a walk from the public bus. I don't know about the disabled parking. 
4882,"The building clearly states it’s name and where the disabled access is outside. The lift however, is operated manually meaning that a person is required to keep the button pressed until they reach the top. Bar is relatively high up but the Wetherspoons app makes it easy for anyone to order food/drink straight to the table "
4883,"It was hot and busy, with the National Trust low on volunteers and staff. None the less, everyone was very friendly and happy to see us, I felt very welcomed."
4884,You cant access the restaurant because of the stairs.
4885,Getting into the Square was easy and it was great to see that there was a new temporary ramp on the George Street side of the Square. No having to go all the way round which can be a long was as a wheelchair user. Getting to the Yurt (it'll always be a tent to me!) was easy along level hard surfaced paths. The entrance to the tent had a temporary surface which was easy to wheel over. A small ridge to pop over and I was in the tent. I was offered a choice of where I'd like to sit; either up front or at the back. I went for the area at the back as my chair is tall and can block others' view.
4886,There is a good size car park. no disables  spaces 
4887,"I had called ahead before I booked on line to make sure it was suitable for wheelchair users and the girl was very helpful, contacting the tour guide to double check and getting back to me quickly. The tour guide was great, he really knew his stuff!!"
4888,The bathroom was a wet room with plenty of grab rails. It is small so wouldn't suitable for somebody permanently in a wheelchair who cant walk. There was only one support rail by the toilet so Lizzie put a frame in for me but it wasn't fixed. For the future 2 fixed support rails would be better.  My wife could get in ok  to help me shower.
4889,"Can't comment on parking. The tram network offers good connections with Paris bus services, which are wheelchair accessible, and with the Metro, most of which is not."
4890,A Museum that looks at the Industrial life of Scotland there are a wide range of exhibits on show these are spread out over a large area. The Main Exhibition hall is all undercover and has a range of displays. There is a wheelchair lift to the upper level this area is used for special exhibitions and displays. There also displays like a Sawmill cottages that cover different periods of time that let you see the way people lived.
4891,There wasn't anyone at reception but there is staff around to help.
4892,"There are designated disabled parking spaces situated directly outside the building.  Next to the parking is a trolley bay which is accessible by wheelchair and provides wheelchair trolleys that attach for convenience. There is a bus stop outside the building on the Leeds Road, a regular service (No 36 stops here), there is a pedestrian access from the bus stop leading to the building, this is also wide enough for wheelchairs to access."
4893,Despite a very long wait for our meal the service was okay.
4894,Blair Drummond is near Stirling & easily accessible by car. A lot of the sightseeing  takes place in the car & there is disabled parking spots in the various car parks.
4895,Lifts take you from ground floor to the first floor where this branch of EAT is located. The entrance is step-free and the whole café is spacious and easy to move around.  There are tables of various heights.
4896,I had no questions about this as I had no major issues.  I used my own manual chair.  I would point out that it it a castle and the many cobbles make for an uncomfortable ride.  It is also worth noting that to view the upstairs I had to transfer to their chair.  A wheelchair will not fit in the lift.
4897,Brilliant level access to Court 1. Perfect viewing position from the wheelchair terrace - slightly elevated in a central position level with the net. It's the best seat in the house but bring a hat as you'll be in the sun. 
4898,Staff are very helpful. They will get you books and journals if you can't reach or carry. They are also very expert and an incredible resource in themselves.
4899,"Brasserie Zedel is a characterful old fashion bar/cabaret and restaurant just a short distance from fully accessible Green Park Tube station and near to the London Palladium or the Royal Academy. The restaurant is in the basement but accessed via a lift and set in a vast underground room with beautiful high ceilings, columns, mirrors and live music. The staff are friendly and the disabled facilities are excellent for such a central location and old building."
4900,"Following our short drive through built up areas, we arrived at this beautiful historical hotel, with nicely laid our grounds that immediately impressed us, and found a couple of disabled bays right by the hotels entrance. The attractive entrance was all on the level, with a double pull handled door that led us into the hotels reception area."
4901,They have a wheelchair accessible door but don't want to bother opening it. They had to move their tables to get a wheelchair in and complained about the hassle as if it were the wheelchair users fault.
4902,The school was very accommodating for wheelchair access with some improvements that could be made.
4903,If arriving by Taxi not all of them can take you  onto the concourse. And there are new arrangements in place for Blue Badge holders for drop off and pick up. For up to date information refer to the station website.
4904,"Whitby's is a lovely old fashioned and yet contemporary fish restaurant opposite the racecourse in Doncaster. The disabled parking is at the rear and yet the entrance is at the front and there is no close drop off point. It's fine for wheelchair, power chair or scooter users but it's quite a distance for anyone using a Walking Aid even to get in the building due to the distance. Once inside it's fine and certainly worth a visit if you can get in the building. There is a fire exit at the front which wold be a lot nearer (and they did open it for us on the way out as no one was sitting at the nearby table) but you can't park outside it without blocking the entrance to the car park. I did ask why it was set up that way and was told it was a local authority ruling. If you can get one of the few spaces beside the Takeaway its a little nearer on foot, but still a fair distance."
4905,I went to the Marina (of Marina and the Diamonds) concert here at the Usher Hall.  The venue is beautiful with lovely cornicing on the ceiling and the disabled seating in the grand circle was fantastic with a great view.  It was a really nice balance of being accessible and also being amongst everyone and able to enjoy the atmosphere.  Both security staff and venue staff were really helpful and welcoming.  It was the first night of Marina's tour and on a Monday night but despite that she managed to get the place buzzing; it was a really fun night and I loved it.   The crowd were really friendly and lots of people chatted to me afterwards.  The accessibility of the venue was reflected in the concert where you truly felt everyone was welcome no matter who they were and it really represented the celebration of difference of all kinds.
4906,"Decent access, decent steak but room for improvement. Staff helpful, but restaurant tight for manoeuvring in a powerchair."
4907,"There's a new visitor centre built alongside the original building, which contains a ramp, lift and accessible toilet. Inside the Cathedral, the Nave has level access, there's a good sight line all the way up the chancel, which is uncrowded, and then vergers can put out portable ramps from the transepts up into the chancel.  The only difficulty I had was that evening prayer was held in a side chapel that had two steps down and no ramp. Vergers were helpful in carrying my chair, but about half the congregation had mobility aids, so it's a strange choice of location."
4908,"The staff are very nice, but they do use the disabled loo"
4909,Friendly and helpful 
4910,"Surprised but delighted to find this pop up exhibition on a walk along the Prom! There are some awesome photos of people in their own environments, whether in Scotland or much further afield! Photos are displayed so that many people can take a look whilst keeping socially distanced and the descriptions were at an accessible height for me and a decent sized font which made them easy to read. This exhibition is titled ""Human Nature"" and is part of this year's Science Festival and will be live until 21st July."
4911,Only one wheelchair user can be admitted at any time. Book in advance to avoid waiting. Only those who can transfer out of their wheelchairs will be able to go on the ride.
4912,"Don't know anything about parking or taxis, I've always got onto the DLR. The train station is a good 800m away on a gentle uphill (from airport to station) slope on tarmac surface. Sometimes the staff will  A lift takes you to the platform. This part of the network is very accessible indeed as it's all the new Jubilee extension and DLR, so you can roll on and off trains. For central London, you can get the DLR to the Jubilee line and go to Green Park, just be sure to look for a sign somewhere on the plaform area with a wheelchair symbol as only SOME of the carriages are level access at Green Park, and you will need to have got on in the middle of the train. "
4913,Plenty of room at table. See above.
4914,Covered parking close to door with level access
4915,There is no wheelchair access due to a step at the entrance.
4916,The staff were excellent. The manager Jon K was extremely attentive and his staff simply couldn't do enough for us.
4917,"The Debaters: A Canadian Comedy Company. Our night out. Controlled rear ramp entry taxi to downtown Hamilton. Texted by Blueline cabs from 5 mins before arrival allowing a seamless pick up for motorised wheelchair user and 3 passengers.....but room for 4.  Easy access to Concert Hall with lay-by at entrance with lowered curb. Automatic outer double doors. Using right side of inner entrance gave easier access to lift. One floor up there is large viewing area for stage, but at back of auditorium. Very good overall vision of the show. Also ramped raised area for even more wheelchairs if needed. Staff member stayed there throughout performance. V helpful. Lots of space. Good ambient temperature. Toilets not used. Taxi was phoned after the show and we had a short 10 minute wait inside around 10pm, which was quite acceptable. The pre arrival text allowed us to stay indoors which was important as outside temperature was 0*C. Return specialised Blueline taxi loading and journey was seamless again. The drivers take it easy, which is important for the chair user in the back. Both drivers were good, and I think Hamilton Cabs have these rear ramped cabs too. Great night out. "
4918,Very friendly and accommodating.
4919,"There are ramps to get into Specsavers but the heavy doors may present an issue if they are left closed but at the moment are kept open to improve ventilation. There is a tiny waiting area that is accessed by going up the ramp where there are two eye test rooms and a set of 3 steps to access the upper area where the hearing test area, contacts lens area, and the rest of the eye test rooms can be found. I did not notice Braille but will try to look out for it next time I visit. The upper area can be accessed through the back door which is up the side alley. The layout and size of the shop are not easy to navigate."
4920,Parking was easy on site. Had to use my own means of transport.
4921,"Great farm shop on the outskirts of Skipton.  Accessible parking with easy flat access into the shop. There is always a staff member at the door in case you need assistance and plenty around inside that are happy to help out.  There is an area at the back that is decorated for the season so great for Halloween goods, Christmas etc. Brilliant selection of wine, plus all the usual farm shop produce.  The café is top notch. Great meals from breakfast to evening and there is also a mezzanine level that sells cakes etc (accessible by the lift)   The only thing that lets it down slightly, hence not a full 5 stars is the disabled toilet.  It's at the back of the café downstairs and although accessible with plenty of room inside to turn a wheelchair, it can be tricky to get to if people haven't tucked their chairs in. It can also be quite cool in the café, not sure if this is due to air conditioning or not but chilly in there, even when its hot outside."
4922,"Fit for a Queen, really big.  Lift to get up to the toilets, had no problems."
4923,"The museum has an accessible toilet and accessible elevators.  There is also a lot of room to move your wheelchair around.  Some areas can get crowded, but it is generally manageable."
4924,"Very nice, and attentive."
4925,"Staff made the visit with table service at meal times, help with refreshments, and nothing was too much trouble.  Breakfast is a self service buffet style and staff were happy to help me with this and carry things to my table."
4926,"Initially I had emailed them but received no reply so I telephoned to reserve a table at their café before the performance. When we arrived there was a table with my name on the 1st floor and time of booking on it. When I ordered my food at the café the staff the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly. They were proactive when they saw my crutch, asked where I was sitting and said that they would take my tray of food up to my table. The waiter got up the stairs and had put the food on the table before I arrived back via the lift. At the interval the café was very busy and the staff served everyone very quickly. Again seeing my crutch they offered to carry my food but as my cake was in a box I didn't need help carrying it."
4927,Friendly and helpful
4928,"Large loos with grab rails, space for a carer, pull cord alarm. Easy to find. Clean and tidy."
4929,"The entrance had automatic doors and no steps which made it easily accessible. However, the aisles are very narrow and maneuverability is definitely a problem. Especially when there is more than one person along the aisle."
4930,Martin (the property owner) visited a couple of times and ensured that are needs were best met with whatever he could reasonably do.
4931,"Az first time visitors we were unsure where we needed to be but a number of staff were waiting to direct guests to their seats. One took us to a lift then led us to my wheelchair space plus carers seat. 4 wheelchair spaces + carers seat are central in the stalls in 2 blocks of 2. I noted more wheelchairs on the ground floor at the ends of the front row, immediately in front of large speakers which I avoid if possible. "
4932,automatic doors but busy entrance way that has a lot of obstacles
4933,"Wheelchair Accessable front entrance ( just!) . V friendly staff & FABLOUS  food. I could fit under only one table but as my chair has a rider I sat at one of the trendy high tables and felt like a normal human being, hurrah! Toilets NOT truly accessible though which is a great shame ( pub up the road has accessible toilet though). However def worth a visit for lunch or dinner if you are in the area."
4934,I didn't go to the cafe so didn't encounter the staff.
4935,I would give 5 stars to the Sorts for confidence coaches and ambassadors. The reception team however are very slow and you need to allow plenty of time to book in as queues regularly form.
4936,There was a lot which was handy.
4937,"All on the ground floor, with wide corridors.  The centre is nearly step free, except for a small step up to the disabled toilet if accessed from outside."
4938,"The chapel is tucked away in Pearson Square, a pedestrianised area with no vehicle access. The chapel is surrounded by tall modern buildings, so you could easily miss it unless you knew it was there. There are a number of pedestrianised paths leading into the square from surrounding streets.  It is very close to Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road. The nearest accessible tube is Tottenham Court Road. Also nearby is Goodge Street, Warren Street and Oxford Circus tube station, which are not step free. There are several buses that go along Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, that stop nearby.  I found the easiest way to find it was to get a bus to Goodge Street tube station, which is on Tottenham Court Road, and then walk along Goodge Street itself. It's a level 5 minute walk to the chapel from here. Walk on the north side of the street and after you cross Cleveland Street, you will find on your right hand side, a pedestrianised path which is the entrance to Pearson Square. Sorry I forgot to take a photo of this. The chapel is in the middle of the square."
4939,"We used this pub twice in a week (once on the way to a holiday and once on the way back). We had good food on both occasions.  On our first visit the pub was busy but the member of staff found us a suitable table (one I could get under in my chair.) At all times she spoke to me. She showed me where the disabled toilet was. ""Do you need me to wheel you?"" And she went on ahead to check the toilet was free.  On our way back we arrived for lunch earlier and the pub was quite. That said the young man who greeted us wasn't sure where to seat us as there were a few bookings. However, a lady came along and sorted it out.  A friendly pub with good facilities and lovely food. If you're visiting nearby Stonehenge or Salisbury it is worth a detour"
4940,Wheelchair ramp right into church 
4941,"Great wheelchair accessible central hotel located above Dundee’s Train Station.  I was kindly invited to an event at this fantastic central hotel in Dundee representing Euan’s Guide as one of their Dundee Ambassadors. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to stay over, but I was able to previously view the hotels accessible room, read on to find out my thoughts. "
4942,"City centre right next to the main bus route, disabled parking spaces available in Chambers street (10 mins walk away)"
4943,"Visited the first time in January, then again later in the year for the Van Gogh exhibition. We'll definitely be back, you can't see a place like this all in one visit. If Van Gogh was anything to go by, the special exhibitions will be well worth going back for too."
4944,"Several bus routes will drop you off nearby in Upper St. The nearest step-free station is King's Cross, well over a mile away."
4945,"Not really relevant for the booking process itself, however when planning for our trip was pleased to see there will be 5 Changing Places toilets in central Edinburgh during the Fringe.  A map of where these will be is shown in the Fringe book and online."
4946,"The bar is attached to the Market Bar, so you go through a door in the back of the bar to access their fully accessible bathroom which has handrails, lots of space, and even a low down mirror. The accessible bathroom also has baby changing facilities"
4947,"The hotel does not have its own dedicated parking but is very close to the car parking facilities at Waverley Railway Station.   For me the proximity to Waverley was welcome as I use public transport, being visually impaired."
4948,"Large, spacious, accessible toilet."
4949,The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.
4950,"Flat access, double automatic doors All on one level wheelchair attachment trollies and trollies to seat older disabled children available Wide spacious aisles uncluttered by extra displays in the centre Plenty of staff available to assist 2 mobility scooters available to borrow on a 'first come , first served' basis, although quite often they are not working (usually due to not being charged) several manual wheelchairs available to borrow wide payment aisle for larger wheelchairs or scooters Staff available to help to pack and/or carry items to your car  "
4951,Good disabled toilet
4952,Staff were helpful and friendly with good manners. 
4953,Visited on NYE and even when its busy I had a nice time and loved the food! 
4954,"As it's in the West End, driving is a bit of a non starter. Nearest stepfree tube is quite a way. We walked/wheeled from Waterloo which was a good 25 minutes."
4955,All the staff are very friendly
4956,"Dedicated spots, bit of a slope to get down to the distillery buildings. Step free into restaurant. "
4957,staff very friendly and helpful
4958,No 'staff' as such but plenty of stewards.  On the gate and crowd control - they are all helpful if gruff due to overwork.
4959,"The staff were very helpful and friendly. The experience started with the security entrance where the checks were sensitively conducted, the reception staff who used the dropped counter so I could talk to them on the level, through to the cafe and shop staff who helped with purchases."
4960,Lots of public car parking
4961,The cafe is at the heart of an attractive park run by the community. The outdoor seating area was sheltered  and bordered by plants in pots. The food was very good.
4962,"Someone at Minsmere told us about this place which did not disappoint. I have never seen anywhere that has put so much effort to enable disabled people to enjoy birds and wildlife. The walkways are fabulous and there are bird feeders everywhere. We particularly came to see Bullfinches and were able to watch them feeding just a few feet away. We also watched voles feeding on food that had been scattered in the woods. We saw a young Tawny owl in one of the many nest boxes. The highlight for me was the ""tame"" field mice kept in the reception area----- I hadn't realised how small they actually are! Please donate to the appeal so that this reserve can be expanded."
4963,"Access into the store is very poor, even going around the store there are to many obstructions  which makes it difficult to get around the store in a wheelchair these are large baskets with goods in & special offers did complain but 2weeks later still the same tried another store in southport that was the same aswell"
4964,Fantastic
4965,"There is an ""accessible"" toilet which is almost useless for wheelchair users. If you are lucky, you will find it open and the access code hand-written on a piece of paper stuck on the door. You will need to type the access code onto the security lock if you can. Inside it's cramped, far too little room to manoeuvre, not even enough room to wash a hamster. There is no emergency cord. This is completely useless! If you fall over you will not be able to summon assistance. It can be a life-and-death matter in the case of a fall and serious injury."
4966,Brilliant apart from a very few exceptions of shops in their building.  Perhaps Oracle could insist all the shops in their building are accessible
4967,"As far as I could see, there were just 2 blue badge parking spaces.  The rest of the car park was gravelled which could be challenging for a wheelchair/scooter. I don't think there is any public transport. "
4968,"Accessible loo is obvious and has a separate door from the other loos. Lots of space to manoeuvre. Plenty of grab rails. Hand dryer is actually beside the sink, which you don't always get! The only difficulty is that it's a pull door to get out - but it's not too heavy."
4969,Nothing out of the ordinary. I did like that my partner went to use their accessible loo (he has EDS and was walking unaided that day) and as he shut the door staff knocked on it and told him he was in a disabled loo and where the regular ones are. As soon as he said he did actually need that loo they backed off immediately. It's a bit annoying when your disability is hidden but it's good to know they are trying to keep the wrong people out :)
4970,There are a couple of freestanding tables and chairs on the pavement outside the café. There is a very small step into the café. Once inside there is a counter at standing height and free standing table and chairs.
4971,Push-button door opener; staff on hand. BIG lift.
4972,Staff are as helpful as they can be and always willing to give directions etc.
4973,"It wasn't too difficult to find by car (with sat nav!) - but there didn't seem to be any public transport options. The car park was quite odd. I was expecting a row of disabled bays next to the entrance (like the other reviewers had said)... but they seemed to have covered them all in masses of plants! Thankfully we visited on a weekday, but at busy times this would have been an issue. Couldn't see a single disabled bay. "
4974,Excellent dedicated disabled toilet
4975,Staff were friendly & attentive.
4976,Access all areas including the Horse itself if you book !
4977,"Very accessible and welcoming coffee shop, most helpful and welcoming venue staffed mostly by volunteers. Accessible parking"
4978,When I asked were the toilets were a member of staff took me to a toilet which was on the same level as the restaurant. The toilet was also had baby changing facilities. The space is too small to accommodate a wheelchair. There was an emergency cord which didn't reach to the floor and a grab rail on the inside of the door which was unreachable when you were sat on the toilet. There was no grab rails near the toilet or sink area.  didn't see the other toilets but I saw a staircase and I assumed they were either up or down a flight of stairs. 
4979,"Flat entrance which is suitable for both manual and electric wheelchairs, a disabled toilet and very friendly and accommodating staff."
4980,Nearby free parking with disabled bays. 
4981,"This is a stunning venue, the theatre is beautifully classic on the interior and modern in the entrance area. A charming cafe is available from refreshments and the accessible toilet is spacious. This  The theatre can remove certain seats in the stalls for wheelchair users. My only warning is that when making your way down to your seating area in the stalls, the floor is in a strange,  urged angle."
4982,The staff were very helpful and pleasant.
4983,Ramp to entrance . Flat throughout. Tables have plenty of space although could be tricky for a chair user.  Staff will endeavour to find a table with easy access. When we have booked in advance a table with extra room and close to loo has been found.
4984,"The staff were really lovely, helpful and friendly."
4985,By car
4986,"Very good service for visitors to the shopping centre, restaurants and integral cinema but somewhat let down by toilet facilities if you are a motorised scooter user but overall a good place to go if you are disabled as plenty of parking spaces and terrific service of bringing one of the centres motorised scooters, electric wheelchairs or ordinary wheelchairs which they bring to your car once you have registered with the centre. The first time you want to use this service you have to go to the customer service desk on the ground floor and register.  You need to take a proof of address with you"
4987,Super helpful & very friendly.
4988,We parked on St Vincent Street which was only a 2 min walk to the cafe. We were able to park for free with our blue badge.
4989,Accessible toilet at Ben Eighe visitor centre but not at Torridon.
4990,"The staff team are very friendly, knowledgeable about the food and drink and happy to ensure that everyone enjoys their visit."
4991,Two accessible loos. Could be better equipped but quite spacious.
4992,Always happy to help
4993,Plenty of Accessible parking with 8 spaces available to away supporters
4994,Staff have always been helpful when I have been they will help you find what you are looking for and will carry things to your car.
4995,"Usually good access to parking, but can be limited near the hall."
4996,"There is an accessible toilet adjacent to the standard toilets. They're located through a side door to the Abbey where you cross a small courtyard into the dedicated toilet block. A helpful attendant held the doors and pointed out the way. On the way out and back in to the Abbey he helped by clearing the way for my chair through the crowds. The accessible toilet was spotlessly clean, spacious and had all the facilities you would expect to find."
4997,Ace! Walkways ace. Signage ace. Theatres all look great - we only visited one - the corner theatre - but the layout in there was great and plenty of space. We were in the main Charlotte Square section of the Book Fest - this year they have expanded along George Street but we didn't visit any of those venues.
4998,Staff were very efficient which is a huge plus! They paid attention when I listed my requirements. They didn't rush us between courses or upsell us to death! 
4999,Taxi rank immediately outside.   Limited parking available (on double yellow lines with a blue badge) at Picardy Place car park.
5000,Spacious and clean 
5001,Staff were excellent from entering the building to exiting.
5002,The staff were fantastic. They spent ages trying to help me find a gift and generally ensured that I felt welcome.
5003,"There is an adapted toilet at dress circle level, an staff will assist with access, but I didn't use this. There is one toilet cubicle on the foyer level which is not accessible which I used."
5004,"There is limited free parking by the main gates to the pond and more up on both side of Charterhall Road.   The 38 bus joins Cluny Gardens with Morningside and stops outside the gates. The 24 & 41 stop at the post office in Blackford Avenue, from there it is a 5 to 10 minute walk or two stops on a 38 on the far side of Charterhall Road. There are ringing traffic lights with drop down kerbs at both Blackford Avenue and Cluny Gardens.  There isn't a cafe so take a picnic from home or pick something up in Morningside or at the Avenue Store opposite the post office. Remember to take all your leftovers home, to reduce the vermin problem."
5005,"Really well equipped rooms on ground floor of hotel for disabled guests. We had a weekend break staying in the accessible suite , which as well as easy access and masses of space, had a kitchen with low level hob and sink . In the bedroom there was a ceiling hoist for easy transfers from bed to bathroom. The bathroom was spacious and the hoist could transfer to bath or to adjustable height Clos -o-mat toilet. Plenty of grab rails made life easy for those like me who can self transfer and stand . Wash basin low level and lever taps made things easy too. All beautifully appointed and luxurious so no suggestion of institutional feel.  Alternative disabled facilities room has roll in shower and full body drier. Indoor swimming pool accessible by shallow steps and rail, or hoist facility. Public building doors are automatic , which are a helpful feature too."
5006,The place is pretty much accessible with ramps everywhere and the paths around the sanctuary are flat and wide. 
5007,Staff were helpful once you arrived at the individual venues.
5008,Clear and very accessible
5009,There is a door to get into the hall leading to Toilets.  Toilets are separate from each other with their own doors.  Disabled toilet has grab rails and red assistance chord.  The room was clean.
5010,Good forward planning for wheelchairs. 
5011,"Having experienced the state of the paths at Colchester Zoo, it was great to visit an animal park that was a pleasure to get around."
5012,Village resort with a Blue flag beach which is easily accessible to people in wheelchairs.
5013,"No issues with staff to date, but staff are varied."
5014,You can opt to sit outside where there are plenty of tables and chairs. These can be moved to provide for wheelchair space. The main door to get inside is wide enough for wheelchair access and there's plenty of space to find a table. A big plus was the availability of gluten free options on the menu.
5015,There is a car park at rear of building but it can get busy and be a bit of a squeeze. There is some on street parking which is handy but road works at the moment meant it wasn’t all available when I visited.
5016,"There are accessible toilets on levels 0 to 4 which are all large with light weight doors. The sinks, hand dryers and toilet flushes are all set at the correct height. The only  negative is the lack of a disabled toilet next to the cafe."
5017,This is my second time visiting Hyde Hall in a wheelchair and find it very accessible. Lots of disabled parking on concrete flat flooring. If you have a manual wheelchair I would suggest hiring a mobility scooter from them as some areas are a bit hilly and gravelly which some manual chairs may struggle with. I have an electric wheelchair which has no issues.   There are lots of seating areas to rest throughout the gardens.   There is a planned route for easy access as some areas do have steps but there are ways round them.   Staff are lovely and very helpful.  Good access in toilets too. 
5018,I hardly met the owners but feel sure they would go out of their way to make things right for you.
5019,Very attentive staff
5020,Friendly helpful staff. Discreetly assisted me without making a big issue. All the staff were attentive.
5021,Accessible loo at the lagoon and the visitor centre. Downside to the toilet at the lagoon is that there is only one accessible loo and that seems to double up as baby changing. As it's the closest loo to the children's play area at busy times you can have to queue for a long time behind the babies. With a facility this new why didn't they have separate baby change?
5022,They are well trained and know their stuff about the history of town.
5023,There is a NCP multi storey car park 3 min walk away.
5024,Semi accessible museum learning about the history of the bag pipes. Also pop-up event next to museum where we listened to piping music from all over the world.
5025,Free parking  nearby with disabled bays.
5026,Loads better than it used to be! The new lifts to take you from and to Princes Street are a big improvement!
5027,There was an accessible portacabin toilet beside the accessible seating area. It was quite small inside and I can imagine it would be difficult for a wheelchair user and a carer to help transfer if needed. There is no Changing Places toilet that is open during the times of concerts at Slessor Gardens.
5028,"To my mind there weren't enough of them about - but there was help with doors, seats & programmes  (although there isn't always someone in the lift which is a black mark!)"
5029,Really good! From the step free entrance to the decent sized lifts (there's different lifts for different parts of the auditorium). There was also clear signage regarding the Hearing Loop.
5030,"Pub 1 of the second day of my accessibility pub crawl in Broughty Ferry. Serves great food, but is a very popular pub so you usually have to book a table. "
5031,One area was roped off and we were trying to look at something at the edge of it so a member of staff removed the plastic chain and said there was no need for it to be closed off and opened it up.
5032,"Between station and the ground is easy going, level and approx 1/2 mile. Entry to the West stand wheelchair spaces is through the gate nearest to the road into the carparks. Stewards are helpful in finding g the way in. "
5033,Friendly and knowledgeable.
5034,A big thank you for saving the day when I got a scooter puncture
5035,There is plenty of disabled parking although it gets very busy at weekends. The car park is about 100 meters from the main entrance.
5036,The disabled loo itself is reasonably spacious with a grab rail on the right side. Doubles as baby changing area so there is a table in the corner. My daughter had no problem moving around in the loo however the small corridor outside is a bit tight and she had to back into the entrance of the men's loo to be able to open the door in to the restaurant. Apart from that she managed well. An easy fix would be to rehang the door from restaurant to toilet corridor the other way.
5037,"Very friendly Staff, Hotel is nice , but a bit old in the rooms, poor access to sockets, accessible rooms OK but a little limited and in need of refurbishment, access to Platinum wing, poor access in bad repair -despite pointing this out on previous stay this has not been changed? are the management listening, usual poorly set out self services making access without assistance difficult. So nice Hotel, little though given to access needs beyond the bare requirements"
5038,"I'll be honest, the drive in was a bit of a nightmare. There are roadworks and road closures everywhere and we ended up accidently driving down a bus only road (expecting a fine). There were some car parks but they looked tight. We parked street side in a disabled bay outside the Head of Steam on Broad Chare, and walked from there. That walk was flat and relatively easy but there are some places where dropped kerbs would be helpful."
5039,A good but basic accessible toilet it was very clean and had grip rails available but not Red cord available the toilet is next to the ladies toilet right next to the ticket point shop café  You access the toilet via a ramp the first door was open  once through this the door was a head of you and opened out the way.  The sink for the ladies toilet is in the area you pass through and so care is required when you open the door in case children are standing waiting on mum   
5040,"We visited by car. Disabled parking is not well sign posted  nor particularly near, especially as lots of No Parking restrictions on single yellow lines throughout the Festival. Nearest bus stops would be in Forrest Road or Lauriston Place."
5041,"There is flat access to all of the seating areas. Disabled seating in the home end is through the normal stands but in the away you are allowed in through an emergency exit. The home disabled supporters are at an elevated view with carers seating next to them, which is great, but in the away end you are  on a makeshift raised platform. This is very poorly designed as although it gives an elevated view, it is too narrow to exit when other wheelchairs are situated alongside you, so you cannot get to the toilet or refreshment facilities until others have moved. This is very frustrating! What is more, your carer has to sit in a seat behind you so it is hard to interact with them. Poorly thought out! "
5042,"It's on the ground floor of the Travelodge at Livingston Centre. Staff helpful, has disabled toilet, plenty of disabled parking spaces, food excellent, no problems"
5043,Level access throughout and a lift.
5044,"The entrance to the pub is flat, making access easy. The establishment was spacious with plenty of room. Staff were waiting to greet customers as they came into the building, this made for a warm welcoming. We were asked if there was anything the assistant could do to help, the staff were always on hand if we needed them.  Huge menu and very accommodating if something wasn’t liked- we will certainly be back!! "
5045,"Great accessible venue with meeting spaces, gym and support"
5046,"Accessed by a ramp from the car park, through a couple of quite heavy doors and into a spacious and well lit dining area. Easy to move a chair so I could get my wheelchair to the table. All very good."
5047,I got a wheelchair accessible taxi and was able to get dropped off right outside the entrance.  
5048,Fascinating place to explore and a top spot for afternoon tea in Falkirk. Lots of engaging exhibits including costume dress ups and tactile activities. Then there's the whole park to explore! The staff are lovely.
5049,"Level access at the entrance and automatic door with a button press. disabled rooms on the ground floor close to the reception, and the Winter Garden Cafe and shop. Lift access to all levels and restaurants and the cinema, Victorian Spa (adults only), Swimming pools, Beauty salon etc.  You can access everything easily in the hotel. "
5050,"Really nice, we just managed to grab a suitable table and they saw this and came to us to take order"
5051,"There were lifts, but nothing really designed for deaf people, like loops, or anyone who BSL."
5052,There was an accessible toilet in the entrance area. Modern and large enough to accommodate a sizeable powerchair.
5053,"Leaving aside the toilet issue, access is good, with modern pavements, tactile paving at road crossings, pedestrian crossings with traffic lights. Bus ramps deploy well in this environment, assuming the ramps themselves are modern and smooth, which is not always the case."
5054,"There are disabled parking bays available close to the Centre allowing easy access, there is also a bus stop outside of the Leisure Centre."
5055,"Located in Bradford city centre, the museum consists of different activities to participate in including interactive galleries, IMAX theatre including one of the largest 3D screens to watch the latest films with space for wheelchair users, alongside cultural and educational activities and events.  A number of wheelchairs are available for use within the museum which can be booked in advance.  There are parking spaces for blue badge holders in the car park. Easy access toilets are available on three levels within the museum, two lifts are available one in particular to accesses all floors, both lifts contain audio announcements, braille and/or raised buttons. The museum shop is also wheelchair accessible and there is a lovely café inside the museum to grab a bite to eat serving a variety of food with really good service, within the café there are two heights of tables to accommodate wheelchair users and all seating is movable. Recommended for a fun day out with great facilities. "
5056,When you get to Colston Hall you should be happy with the access. It looked very good for anyone with sensory or mobility problems. I had no issues with access anywhere within the venue.
5057,There is one level access door but bring someone with you as it is usually locked.
5058,Steps to the entrance and need to use a slope to a fire exit if using a wheelchair.
5059,The staff were really great and I'm sure they could tell you where a book is or help you get one that is out of reach. I also loved meeting their dog who just wanted to play! Overall it was a really nice atmosphere and they do have a great selection of books.
5060,Friendly and informative.
5061,We mentioned needing access to the rear of the car so were given a spot with plenty of space. In conversation the staff also mentioned that we could have driven down to the water if necessary (there was a short compact gravel path from the activity centre to the water)
5062,Good facilities but not as clean as they might be.
5063,Not a lot of room.
5064,Excellent accessibility aware staff 
5065,No trouble parking in designated spot. Can’t comment on public transport although the place is only about two minutes from the nearest town.
5066,"Lots of space in the Loo plenty of room to maneuver a powered wheelchair. Everything in the one room a wash hand basin, toilet, shower and a bath also a commode shower chair. Still room for a power-chair and a portable hoist if needed. Photos on the website will show the layout of the room. A standard toilet with drop-down bars, also a toilet raiser so all sizes catered for with the commode shower chair going over the toilet."
5067,"Fantastic purpose built house, lowered additional sink in large kitchen, lowered hob. Fully adapted bedroom with ceiling hoist to wet room and profiling bed."
5068,Helpful.
5069,"There is only one toilet for all customers to use. This isn't an accessible toilet.  This is up a couple of stairs, so wouldn't be suitable for people with mobility difficulties.  I'm not sure if it is possible for them to do anything to change this within the building"
5070,"I got a taxi from the airport which cost about 20 euros. The hotel is one road behind Place de Verdun, which has a small bus station. The train station is further away, but as I didn't use it I'm sorry but unable to comment."
5071,"The entrance is via a short, quite steep sloping upward path and there is a railing on one side, which could be used as a hand rail, although when I was there a couple of bikes were changed to the railing. The ground floor is step free as wherever there was a change in height there was a ramp. The ground floor tells the early maritime history. The upper floor is only accessible by stairs. There's about 20 - 25 stairs and apart from the bottom 2 - 3 steps, the majority of the steps have a handrail. The upper floor depicts Crete's more recent history, from the early 1900s."
5072,"Access to building is good, fortunately we knew to go to back door to access the lift from there.  Press the buzzer and open door. The lift is huge, which is great. On the first floor we arrived at the shop. To get to rest of first floor, go through shop.    Staff are helpful.  Access is good. Parking at back.  Quite a few spaces next to the door for disabled users.   Only thing is if you come by bus, nearest Lothian buses is a few minutes away on Queensferry Road.   Which is ok if that is ok.   What has improved on that front is , that there is now the 43 as well as the 41."
5073,Ramp at front door to help with small step.  Main routes in museum and cafe uncluttered so 'clear runs' in most places with perhaps a few narrow corners in museum.
5074,Brunch and Brew had loos accessible to all. 
5075,I went to use the disabled toilets but it was locked by a coded padlock and being used for storage. When I told the manager they shouldn't be doing that he was very rude and said I was coming across as mean. All other staff members were polite and helpful.
5076,"Friends had to go in and ask for ramp. 2 ramps that were quite steep were put out by a stoney faced staff member and not the easiest to manage. No disabled access  to outside seating in garden at back, so forced to sit inside in dark interior and sunny outside. "
5077,"This is a specialist holiday place in the UK for people with autsin/send and other disabilities.  It is amazing, there is a huge pool that everyone can use on their own for an hour every day. The park is accessible and the Forrest is wheelchair accessible.  The grounds are all flat and great for anyone with a disability.  The houses are beautiful and 5*"
5078,"The house has a range of ramps and one wheelchair lift,however there are some areas of the house that cannot be accessed by wheelchair users."
5079,"There is a very small step (couple of inches or so) up into the cafe, but should not be a problem for a wheelchair user. Once inside there is ample space & is all on one level."
5080,Staff are friendly and eager to help (the security man on the front door was very chatty and helpful and told me he was going to buy the cashmere jumper for his father) but as mentioned above it is NOT OK to regard accessibility barriers as something to laugh at. 
5081,Parking is fine.
5082,George Street has taken on a new look with the restaurants and bars moving into the street.
5083,"I took a taxi to/from the hotel booking the taxi company which featured on the hotel's website. It was easy arranged. The vehicle was a people carrier and on the way back they brought a people carrier with a slide out step for easier access. There are buses from La Rochelle. St Martin de Re La Port bus stop is 2 minutes away from the hotel. The buses are coaches and the door by the driver has a sign for people with mobility difficulties, although there was a hand rail, the steps were still quite steep. The middle door of the buses are labelled with a wheelchair sign. "
5084,It was easy to walk the nearest train station from Kew Garden station to  Kew Garden about 10 mins 
5085,"There is parking right outside the entrance although it’s gravel not tarmac . No steps to enter the cafe. The majority of the tables and chairs are free standing so can be moved to allow access for wheelchairs . I use a mobility scooter but it’s about 5 metres to the door so I just used my stick.   The food is very good , but limited menu. The portions are enormous.   There is a small park outside for little children and a fenced off area with baby goats and ducks.  I didn’t use the toilets so can’t comment on them.  This is a lovely little cafe with friendly staff and great food."
5086,"Techniquest has several disabled parking bays near the entrance. The building is accessible with automatic doors, a lift and disabled toilets."
5087,The place is completely accessible with level access throughout the inside and outside of the building. The staff are friendly and welcoming.  Would definitely recommend this cinema for anyone visiting the area.  
5088,Good. Staff very helpful. Decent amount of space between tables to manoeuvre. Tables at good height for wheelchair and chairs easily moved out way.
5089,"New wetroom being installed gave us a perfect excuse to decant to Homelands for a week.  We've been before but have never stayed in Massney.  It was as good as Cardy and Drummochy, where we've stayed on previous trips.   Ceiling hoists should be fitted at home for everyone - they are so easy to use.  A good friend joined us for a few days and was impressed by the space and the sheer luxury."
5090,We were very happy with the lodge and it was very well equipped. Weather was great. Would go back. 
5091,Not good we parked and walked to the venue
5092,Lift. Travelator.  Cafe has 1 BSL user. Unsure of store.  Wide isles.  Very knowledgeable staff who will help Both store and cafe 
5093,lots of disabled toilets around the hotel
5094,"Quite reasonable accessible toilet, I have seen a lot worse.  Clean and bright but need to widen gap to allow wheelchairs to access toilet."
5095,"Almost everything about the gym is wheelchair accessible, the one thing that isn't is the upstairs dance studio and some doors are a bit narrow but manageable. but other than that really good access."
5096,"Disabled parking with direct ramped access at the main hotel entrance, while the 3 ground floor bedrooms can gain via patio doors to their own dedicated parking spaces. Public transport I would suggest is non-existent and a car would be essential for getting around the area."
5097,"Didn't have much contact with staff, so can't say."
5098,Not much contact with staff but helpful when required
5099,"On previous visits to participate in a birdwatching day a course trapping and studying small mammals my needs were considered. On the first a volunteer went with us to make sure I didn't get stuck when we went off the hard path. On the second, the humane traps were placed so that I could access them."
5100,Great! Plus there is a new bike with wheelchair section on the front you can hire.
5101,"We had a wonderful visit to the JL store to receive a cheque on behalf of the Hearing Dogs charity and was made to feel so welcome by the staff in the store, especially Veronica. They made us feel special. Thank you all."
5102,"Great toilet - spacious, well-equipped and clean.  It is also accessed through a single door from outside.  However, the small step from the outside needs addressed so that those without help can get in easily."
5103,"If you aren't driving to the store, there is a large walkway down the car park that leads you down to the main street where there are very easily accessible bus stops, the walkway is very wide and flat making it very friendly towards people who need the space and need adaptable technologies eg wheelchairs or walking aids. in addition to this there are multiple disabled parking spaces close the the shop entrance."
5104,Free wheelchairs were available for those who required one.
5105,all good
5106,Flat venue throughout.
5107,"I didn't speak to any staff, but they all seemed very friendly."
5108,Staff were so kind and helpful. 
5109,"The cobbles on the listed paving outside are not comfortable but once you are inside, it is a smooth, pleasant journey with lifts to each floor. Some great art, gift shop and a cafe."
5110,Is on a main bus route but there is a 2 minute walk from bus stop which is uphill so may be difficult for wheelchair users.
5111,"Easily accessible, friendly staff. "
5112,"Easy to get around, good lifts to all public areas. Several tables with height adjustment in the cafeteria reserved for wheelchairs. For me personally the best disabled toilet is on the top deck, as the others have automated buttons on the wall for opening and closing."
5113,The farm was clearly signposted from the road. Everything at the cabin was on one level. The site is very sloping due to the nature of the environment (Peak District) and assistance would be required for wheelchair users to get around the farm. The kitchen is not adapted for wheelchair users.
5114,accessible two loos for male and female.  Easy to find. Seemed enough space for a small wheelchair to menouver in the ladies . No red cord. clean.
5115,"This is a fantastic open space in Falkirk, not too far from Grangemouth. The Helix is made up of three main parts and includes the famous Kelpie sculptures (massive water horses). The access into and around this park is great, as all the paths are smooth surfaced and are wide enough to let a truck through (which is exactly what they are used for when there are deliveries or waste removal)."
5116,Disabled toilet ( no hoist)
5117,Very knowledgeable and caring. Any and all questions answered well!
5118,"Everyone exceedingly helpful. Very aware, nothing is any trouble to them."
5119,So I was happy with most of the visit to the restaurant/pub until I got into the disabled loo with my partner who is in a wheelchair and needs assistance to get into the toilet we had to figure out how to situate around the toilet like normal as most toilets insist on putting a changing table in the way but enough of that I was looking around as my partner noticed that the loo seat was broken and I noticed that the cord for anyone who needed assistance was cut very short to where I couldn’t even reach it standing so if you go don’t go alone to the loo or if u do make sure you have someone check on u
5120,"This was our first successful stay away since my stroke, so we were nervous. But there was no need as Daisybank cabin is so ell equipped  for a wheelchair user. Especially the wetroom/toilet which was spacious and fitted with an over the toilet commode chair doubling as a shower chair. The ability to move the washbasin out of the way of the wheelchair was another bonus and the height was perfect for using the washbasin from the wheelchair. We didn't try out the sink which could be lowered in the kitchen as we used the dishwasher for most things. The kitchen was well equipped and fully accessible to me, even though I only have full use of one hand. I would recommend Hoe Grange accommodation to anybody who needs appropriate accommodation after a stroke, although I do need some help from my carer/husband. The view from the window of the 2 grazing horses was particularly relaxing. We shall have to return to experience the whole place when the rain and wind keep off!"
5121,Beautiful accessible country park where you explore in the woods and look out for wildlife.
5122,"There is one toilet in the Chocolate Lounge and this is an accessible toilet. The door is a little tight to get in, but once inside it has grab rails and room to turn. There were two bins in here which was taking up a little more space than necessary. There are more toilets in the shop section of the building, but I do not know if any of these are accessible."
5123,A number of accessible toilets available. Great.
5124,Brilliant. Right outside and a very short distance to get inside.
5125,A very flat campsite. Many of the pitches are hard standing covered with gravel. But would be fine with a wheelchair   There are two toilet and shower blocks both with disabled access / family bathrooms.
5126,All level except the Abby itself which is only accessible when they provide a ramp for special events. Outside - no problem at all on the whole site.
5127,Accessible parking is outside the restaurant entrance and there are drop off areas at the entrance of the hotel.
5128,"A number of disabled bays are available, with a nice level push to get you into the hotel, and reception will direct you to the Gym, on ground floor, and a lift will take you up to second floor for the health club. That is then on the level as well."
5129,"Very clean  and well maintain toilets, disabled toilets only for self-transfer"
5130,"There are several toilet facilities. All the toilets are spacious and all have disabled facilities. However they are mainly populated around the food areas of the park. There are none, that I can recollect, around the zoo area."
5131,"There is a concrete path up to the main entrance, all on one level not a lot of room in the main entrance, as this is the gift shop too. (staff are will to help move things around but did not need to) I did manage to maneuver wheelchair into Exhibition room and then outside to the activities. Some parts are chipping stones not so good for wheelchair. Only part we could not access was the Crannog itself. "
5132,"The access at the terminal is good, there is a ramp at the entrance and a disabled toilet as well and also a lowered check-in desk specifically for wheelchair users. They obviously thought about wheelchair users which was great! On the ferry there were wheelchair accessible cabins and there was a lift to get to the shops etc and to get to the car bit. The ferry has smooth floors all through the ferry."
5133,"There is a wide ramp on both sides of the door which is heavy so assistance will be needed. Once inside, the restaurant can be easily negotiated and staff will help with tables etc. The menu is on a buffet basis so when going up for food, be aware of the other diners."
5134,I got a bus from Glasgow Buchanan street into Edinburgh city centre and walked to my venues.
5135,"Only deducted half a star because there's a door to open before you reach the disabled loo  - planning regs I suspect or something similar. I dare say the staff would have helped me with it if I'd been alone.  Accessible loo had everything I needed, clean, well equipped etc."
5136,Great ground for disabled access. No messing around. Quick and easy ??
5137,The whole building is very accessible with lifts and disabled toilets 
5138,"Poor, a steepish ramp needed to get into hotel, then level for most of your use. There are steps around for other areas such as terrace area, and we did not see or hear of any lift facilities. We are concerned about a steep ramp you will need to get up into hotel if you need to use public toilets, which are not disabled friendly. You will find enough seating to rest, or enjoy drinks. "
5139,"Perfectly designed, huge space"
5140,Staff were very friendly - you obviously have a waiter/waitress assigned to your table so it is good that they know exactly how to deal with you. 
5141,"Both male and female toilets are located inside the station. However a sign inside the station might help in finding these easier. The toilets provide access for wheelchair users, however could be made easier to use if more space was provided to move around."
5142,Definitely 5*. Genuinely friendly and helpful when required.
5143,"Lotherton Hall is a great place for people of all ages and is very accesible for wheelchairs and mobility scooters. There were numerous wheelchairs and mobility scooters in use on the day i visited. The grounds  are very flat and there are lovely garden areas with children's play equiptment and picnic benches. The bird garden is currently undergoing re furbishment to enhance the facillities for the birds. However, this does not spoil the walk round the bird garden which is very nice. The paths round the bird garden are wheelchair friendly. The restaurant is lovely serving a variety of food and beverages and the courtyard outside is a nice place to sit if the sun is shining. Opposite the courtyard are the toilets one of which is accessible for wheelchairs. A great place to  go if the weather is good and a reasonable price too!"
5144,"No one particularly helpful, it was clearly obvious I was disabled but no attempt was made to let me know about any disabled facilities"
5145,"Level access, smooth floors. Easy to wheel in. Only issue is that there are lots of tables and if full, turning space could be limited.  Similarly, getting past diners at the seats near the entrance or by the stairs might be difficult if busy - we were there early evening and it was fine."
5146,Lifts are available to all floors. Induction loops are also available. Easy access to spacious seats. Some of the cinema seats are on level ground so stairs will not be an issue. 
5147,You can park next to the Chalets to off load and then park in an adjacent carpark across the road
5148,"Me, my husband, our son, his lady and their dog.  The museum was all on one level and all areas were comfortably wide enough for the mobility scooter. An interesting  visit."
5149,Best venue in the UK for disabled people.
5150,"I chose the venue based on a previous review in Euan's Guide and it did not disappoint.  We were welcomed at the door.  The table was the right height to allow my knees to go underneath comfortably.  While we were choosing what to eat from the menu we were offered a choice of music - I must add we were the only ones in the restaurant, all the others were having bar lunches.  I was conscious that I had a dinner booked that night so I decided just to have a starter and a sweet.  I had medallions of black pudding on a bed of apple and tomato with a poached egg.  A meal in itself!  This was followed by a chocolate brownie.  A work of art.  All for under £14.  Brilliant."
5151,The staff with the ferry company were very friendly. welcoming and helpful. One of them seeing my crutch told me about the choice of stairs or path when I arrived at the island. On the island itself there's no staff around until you arrive at the restaurant or entrance to the monastery. The lady who let me through to the church service was very polite and welcoming.
5152,Staff good.
5153,The Loch House is a great place to go for dinner or lunch with friends or family. The restaurant has a car park with disabled parking spaces available. The restaurant has a ramped entrance The main doors at the entrance are heavy manual doors but would be manageable with help. The restaurant itself is very spacious and well laid out with space between tables. The restaurant has great views over Lochwinnoch.
5154,"The site map doesn't show a recommended accessible route. However it clearly marks the various routes according to the surface which I prefer personally. There are firm tarmac routes, some that are compacted earth and then some that cross fields so are quite bumpy.  The site has lots of gates but these are easily opened. However there are two kissing gates which are a struggle for a mobility scooter or power trike - my husband refuses to be beaten by anything so I was unceremoniously bumped through them but I will avoid next time! There are alternative routes to avoid these. Dogs aren't allowed in the formal gardens and signs clearly show where this is the case. "
5155,Not sure where the toilets were as not signage
5156,The gardens try to include everybody - would be ten but for the slopes that have to be negotiated - cannot really help that as it's part of the character of the gardens.
5157,Brilliant!! Swanky ramps on both sides of the entrance. Go past the (most amazing!) stairs in the foyer area and you find the Sackler lift - wonderful design in keeping with the rest of the building. Loved the large print guides in all the different galleries. Galleries spacious and easy to navigate - artwork at all different levels. In the architecture section the tables were at a great height so you could get up close to the exhibits. There were plenty of benches in the galleries too if you wanted to sit down for a moment.
5158,Fine on a fully charged scooter but some parts would be inaccessible if powering your own wheelchair.
5159,Very visibly marked disabled parking bays.
5160,Lots of space on lower level of the cafe and there's a good sized accessible loo
5161,"The staff were excellent. From the concierge helping with the door and lift through to the sales team. I was offered assistance to help choosing and trying on the items I was interested in - the fitting rooms may not suit all wheelchair users. At the counter, staff packed my purchases and offered to place them in my chair's back pack. I took time out to look at the restaurant and the magnificent views; again staff were welcoming and happy to help."
5162,"We arrived by car, the Blue Badge parking area was clearly marked and there was ample room even for the largest of vehicles. The pathways from the carpark to the reception are very good, the reception itself is also accessible and they even have their own onsite wheelchairs for any ambulant guests that might feel its too much of a walk."
5163,We visited St Paul's Cathedral by public transport. The number 11 bus brought us all the way from London Victoria train station. The only down side was the turning circle on the number 11 bus to get into the position needed. I have a mid wheel power wheelchair and the turning is great but I could not get into the opening correctly.
5164,"The Venue Cymru carpark facilities include disabled spaces.  However, for anyone not coming by car, the theatre is a fair walk from the centre of Llandudno / most of the hotels."
5165,Law courts in an ornate gothic style building. I visited as part of Open House weekend.
5166,The fish and chips are great and the ice cream is amazing.  The takeaway counter is accessible and the staff are very friendly.  There is a restaurant which is accessible with help - the tables and chairs can be moved.  The toilet is not accessible for wheelchair users.   The nearest disabled toilet is in the Community centre about 100 yards away across the road.  
5167,"Can't comment on the parking, though there seemed to be a few spaces outside the churchyard. A number 20 bus from the city centre gets you quite close. The pavement by the nearest stop in High St is v narrow. Best to get off at Dunbar Street, walk back along St Machar's Drive and turn right along the Chanonry. Pavement narrow & a bit bumpy but manageable. From the Dunbar At bus stop to the Cathedral is about 7 minutes wheel/walk."
5168,"The do try to help but the lack of ramps and a disabled toilet is not good, this is because the age of the building "
5169,"The main entrance is at the cathedral's West End, where there are 24 steps with a handrail to get to the entrance. The step free entrance is in the south churchyard. It's signposted but the entrance is not obvious, see photo. If you are standing facing the main entrance, the step free entrance is on the right hand side. If you are coming from the Millennium Bridge, when you approach St Paul's, you are directly facing the south side where the step free entrance is.  There is step free access via the lift to the cathedral floor and crypt. There is also step free access to the quire, by a user-operated chairlift on the north side, or alternatively 3 steps.   Later in 2019, 2 permanent ramps and a staircase with handrails, will be built on the north side of the cathedral, which will then become an additional public entrance to the cathedral. When I visited I saw the model and pictures for this, see photos.  I had a special tour round the cathedral and crypt area by Ann. She was amazing as I learnt so much about the history and architecture of the building. She pointed out things that I might not have noticed otherwise and she had lots of fun facts and anecdotal stories. She showed me the best place to view the interior of the dome and we also went behind the cordon and sat in the quire stalls, which was very special indeed.   On the way round we also talked about access. The cathedral offer touch tours for people with visual impairments and she showed me the Henry Moore statute, which is one of the statues featuring on the touch tour. They also offer BSL tours. There’s an induction loop on the cathedral floor and crypt. They offer braille and large print booklets for services. Assistance dogs are welcome.   When I visited the cathedral was busy, but it is also spacious so it’s easy to find a quiet spot away from the crowds and noise. There is also lots of seating in the nave. In the nave look out for the grating on the floor, see photo.  In the crypt the lighting levels are a bit lower and some of the floor is uneven due to memorials or mosaics flooring. They have had ramps fitted so the crypt is step free.  Overall given the age and listed status of the building St Paul’s is a fabulous example of how historic buildings can be accessible."
5170,"Decent bus service, the Lothian 22 or the 1 is handy, but coming back into the town at night, the 22 bus stop feels a bit isolated."
5171,Flat access from carpark to all shops.
5172,Accessible theatre with helpful staff. Easy to access the wheelchair accessible seating and good loos!
5173,Very wheelchair friendly
5174,Very friendly and helpful staff - one staff member was really helpful and pointed out that there was an 'accessible toilet' if I didn't fancy going downstairs.
5175,"Excellent hotel, right next to the train station and little shopping centre right in the middle of town.  Room nice and spacious, my wheelchair had plenty room to get around.  Shower room huge, with underfloor heating - great for defrosting frozen toes!  The door from the hallway to the room opens out into the hall which makes exiting so much easier.  I took .5 points off as the ramp up to the shower room door is steep (I can walk and kept forgetting on the way out, almost falling a few times), the beds are a little low (I had to get help getting up from mine) and the floor is very slidey (great for wheelchair not so much for walking in socks).  Staff are lovely (I don't think they sleep!), lifts are speedy and spacious enough.  Will definitely stay there again if back in Oslo."
5176,"The staff are sweet and helpful, and keen to fetch whatever you like the look of on the annoyingly temperamental tablet display.   One star lost for allowing the tablet to be kept in such a ramshackle state. "
5177,"Parking off street, CCTV, limited to 2hrs.  Bus stop on both side of the street - traffic light controlled, drop kerbs. Ramp/steps from the street."
5178,Disabled parking bays near the main entrance.
5179,"Very friendly, not many just walking about ."
5180,Very nice and helpful.
5181,There is step free access to the restaurant although you do have 2 steps to go up in the back part of the restaurant. 
5182,All Staff were friendly & helpful
5183,"A number of bays are available, but not very close to cafe or toilets, and your carer will have to hold you back as you go downhill to start with, I just put my brakes on and gently turned the wheels, but coming back was hard work coming up the hill, at least I got warm again with the effort. Entering cafe was not to difficult, but should have used the far doorway beyond the front of cafe as it was easier to get to seats to drink the Luke warm coffee. Entry into toilet facilities was not much better, and had to get out of chair to use toilets, and only did so as a bit urgent, the look and smell put my wife off completely so she didn’t bother."
5184,"Friendly, helpful staff. Enthusiastic and knowledgeable."
5185,Disabled parking space in front of building - perfect.
5186,An accessible toilet is available in the courtyard area by the visitor centre. It was spacious enough and well equipped; albeit rather busy.
5187,Excellent accessibility to all properties. An unusual and welcome feature is the garden with raised beds which is accessible to all guests.
5188,"Level access to main toilets on ground floor, but not disable friendly. Disable friendly on lower floor with space and grab handles."
5189,There are lots of Disabled parking bays available in the car park. I haven't visited using public transport. 
5190,"Level former station platform, no steps to entrance (just a very small threshold to negotiate), level throughout inside, room between tables to fit wheelchair.  Helpful staff moved chair to enable me to transfer and opened door when I left."
5191,"The staff were exceptional and very friendly. This is a small hotel and there seems to be a strong emphasis on good customer service and all staff spoke English. Reception was always staffed and very helpful. At breakfast there was waitress service for hot drinks an self service for cold drinks and food, the lady was very efficient, one day she swapped the chairs around so I could have  firm chair and she always asked how I was and what my plans were for the day. When I requested a bath mat this was dealt with quickly and willingly."
5192,The Wellcome Collection is centrally located on Euston Road and almost opposite Euston Station. Also nearby are Euston Square and Warren Street Tube Stations. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross. There are a number of buses that stop very close by. I travelled on public transport to get there and it was only a 2 minute walk from getting off the bus.
5193,"Assistance would be needed to access the toilet as a door opens onto another door which may make it difficult alone, the toilet itself is good  with quite a lot of space and handrails "
5194,Helpful and pleasant.
5195,The hotel was fully accessible. There were no steps at the entrance. The guest rooms where accessible via an internal lifts. The same lifts allowed access to the rooftop bar. The swimming pool was accessible and the restaurant could be accessed using a wheelchair platform stair lift. (See photos)
5196,"They have a really small car park. Whilst they have 3 disabled bays, I couldn’t use one as a sports car with no blue badge was parked in the space, so I had to park across the road. "
5197,Staff were friendly and helpful 
5198,Spacious accessible toilet.
5199,"No disabled parking spaces, no lined spaces at all, very uneven ground"
5200,Should be a perfect trail for accessibility but marred by variable surfaces on the part we tried and bikers and some walkers who have never heard of social distancing.
5201,"I got the bus the whole way, the 12 from Leith walk, there is a stop in front of the zoo on both sides of the road."
5202,The building is a maze of floors and corridors. You do need a hand if you haven’t visited before.
5203,"They have push button operated automatic doors at each entrance. The aisles have good space to navigate around although it was quite quiet while we were there, may be more difficult if there at a busy time. There is level access throughout the market."
5204,We followed the cycle paths to do a lovely circular walk from Lyndhurst va Brockenhurst. With e-motion wheels and a freewheel this was able to be done independently... until the very end when the batteries ran out!  (approved off road routes: http://mediafiles.thedms.co.uk/Publication/NF/cms/pdf/Cycle_routes_in_the_New_Forest_National_Park.pdf)
5205,The staff and volunteers are brilliant. What is remarkable in the context of staff attitudes at many other nature sites is their very obvious willingness to take on board suggested access improvement where it is possible to enhance conditions within budget constraints and construction abilities.
5206,The venue itself was not good as limited disabled friendly seats and access. 
5207,The toilet was one of the best I have seen.  There was enough room to turn my wheelchair round.  Very clean.
5208,they were very friendly not very chatty though
5209,"Plenty of room. Had handrails. Good signage, all on same floor. "
5210,Great hotel right next to queen street station. Couldn't be more central. Staff were so helpful nothing was a issue for them. First hotel I've been in that actually went through a PEEP (fire evacuation plan) which I thought was great and made me feel very comfortable staying there. We had booked an accessible room and it was huge! Lots of space to move around and the bathroom was very accessible with the wet room being very suitable with handrails etc.. Picture below.  The only issue we had was there was no sockets beside the bed to plug in my medical equipment I need overnight. But we went went to reception and asked for an extension cable which we got no bother. Overall a great stay and will definitely be back.
5211,Tower Hill tube station is about a five minute walk away.
5212,"Brand new accessible wet room on ground floor, with handles and grab rails. Wheel-in chair for shower, raised loo-seat and rails."
5213,Very informative. Very helpful and pleasant.
5214,"Self opening doors, low level kiosks and ticket desks, lifts and specific wheelchair spaces in the auditorium with the flexibility to accommodate carers."
5215,"It is so great to see the baby changing facilities separate from the accessible toilet! The toilet was large and clean, and I even spotted a Euan's Guide Red Cord Card!"
5216,"Every time I've been here they have been great. No fuss, just inclusive."
5217,There is very little seating available for visitors except for benches in the Studio but portable stools are available fro you to take round with you.
5218,This retail and leisure complex is easy to find.  There are quite a few disabled parking spaces just 10 - 20 metres from the restaurant.
5219,"The Post Office is accessible throughout. Outer door entrance of 1170mm, which are always open when the PO is open, and inner automatic sliding doors 1030mm. Doorbell by the entrance. Slight incline up to entrance. Wide spaces and corridors inside. Standard counter top 1020mm high. Parcel machines are 930mm high. Indoor posting boxes 1260mm and outdoor posting boxes 1260mm high."
5220,Reduced access for wheelchairs. The cafe which is attached (Yaffle Cafe) has no access.  
5221,Staff were brilliant. Everyone we met was helpful and polite.
5222,"There is parking on the road along the North side of the river, or at the theatre or swimming pool. Lots of space. Close to city centre public transport links. "
5223,"At the main entrance  on Piccadilly there is a short flight of stairs down into the main shop. Next to this is a platform lift. I had used it previously and found it to be jerky to use. On my most recent visit I decided to go down the stairs as it has a hand rail, in preference to using the lift. I'm mindful that not everyone will have a choice so it would be appreciated if the lift could be upgraded. There are lifts to all floors, but sometimes they take a while to arrive.  "
5224,"Hi I have just been to Morrison’s supermarket , Stranraer today. I was very pleased to see the renovations that have been done. The disabled parking is in a better location, access much better, isles wider and the most impressive part is the disabled toilet facilities, these have been finished to a very high standard. Well done Morrison’s 👏"
5225,"Ramps are located at the main entrance, and there is plenty of room inside the restaurant to maneuver a wheelchair or scooter.  De Bokkesprong is also located near beautiful bike trails that take you through the nearby forest, dunes, and beach."
5226,On street blue badge parking is close by to the Gallery. Accessible buses pass nearby. Taxis can drop off almost at the door.
5227,"Chester Zoo has 100 disabled parking bays at the front of the car park closest to the main entrance to allow easy access to and from the zoo. This car park is tarmac and therefore suitable for wheelchair users or those with visual impairments.  Buses are available to/from Chester city and train station, these operate on a regular basis and have disabled access. However there is a longer walk to this stop from the main enterance"
5228,Access to the building is via a ramp with an automatic sliding outer door and a push button operated double inner door. Door width is good.  The bar and eating area is accessed by one ramp. The other two doorways have steps.  There is plenty of room for a wheelchair on the tables by the main walkway although it gets a bit cramped on the tables in the middle.   To access the cinema there is an open top scissor lift (see photo) beside the stairs which takes you down to cinema 2 and 3 and a traditional lift (108cm x 140cm) which takes you up to cinema 1.  Loses one point as the lifts are a bit small and dated.
5229,There is more than sufficient disabled parking.
5230,A bit stretched at times but we were in no hurry and the food really was cooked for us. Staff charming and friendly.
5231,There is a train station and local buses in Alnwick.  Alnwick Gardens was well organised for disabled visitors arriving by car. There is a whole car-park dedicated to 'blue badge' holders and this is the closest to the main entrance.  
5232,"Nearest tube stations are Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus neither which are step free. Nearest step free tube is Green Park and then bus no 14, 19 or 38 to Shaftsbury Avenue. China Exchange is on Gerrard Street, the main street in London's Chinatown. It is pedestrianised from 12noon to 6am, with the nearest drop off point is Macclesfield Street."
5233,This is a nice walk with views of Arthur's Seat. The map gives some idea of the most accessible paths (I recommend the one marked as a cycle path) but there are a few surprises on some of the paths which look like they have been recently resurfaced with loose gravel.
5234,"Cheap and cheerful pub with lovely, friendly staff that cannot do enough to help. Easily accessible for those with a disability as it has ramps, an accessible toilet and flat floors."
5235,Route to cafe through shop could usefully be wider.
5236,Good access for wheelchairs. A lovely day out with lots of space for everyone. There were really friendly and helpful staff in the café.
5237,The wheelchair access isn’t the best however the food makes up for it - just don't order bolognese. 
5238,"An independent fully accessible Garden centre with disabled parking. Sells indoor and outdoor plants, shrubs and trees as well as garden furniture and gifts. There is also has a large waitress service cafe serving a wide variety of food available all day and 5 evenings a week. Staff in the garden centre and cafe always friendly and helpful."
5239,"If you are like me and think the Pitlochry Dam is beautiful you are in for a treat! This is the perfect place to view the Dam, learn a bit more about it's history and of course, sit back relax with a coffee!  "
5240,"The main areas and restaurants are fully accessible with accessible toilets.  There is plenty of room to maneuver a wheelchair, and ramps are provided when needed. All lifts have  handle bars on the side to use when necessary.  There is also an accessible boat ramp.  The accessible hotel rooms, have a large bathroom equipped with shower stools, and railings.  All the rooms have plenty of space  to move around.  The doorways are also wide, making it an ideal place for wheelchair users to stay."
5241,I went to receive my vaccines and everything was so well thought out and organised. 
5242,Good pub food about half a mile from RHS Harlow Carr.
5243,The service is entirely geared for disabled people and the staff and amenities assist in ensuring that this is a holiday completely accessible for all individuals. Such a wonderful place.
5244,Adequate.You always want more space but it did the job. Children's high chairs are stored there. Would be better if they could keep them elsewhere.
5245,"Nice tea room with lovely food. However, there are serious access restrictions as it is first floor and above which can only be accessed by going up stairs therefore not suitable for people in wheelchairs etc. Also the room is quite crammed which may cause people to feel claustrophobic. "
5246,"There is a good low gradient ramp into the side door. The door is not automatic so you need staff to catch your eye, however each time I've visited it's been really busy and I've been welcomed inside rather quickly. There's a wee bit of a bump over the threshold but once inside you have clear access past a row of tables to the main body of the restaurant or through to the bar. The tables are a good height to get your legs under if you're a wheelchair user. The floor surface is level and smooth. If it is really packed you might need a few folk to pull their chairs in but there is space enough to move through the restaurant in a wheelchair."
5247,The accessible loos are huge including all the usual grab rails etc - and also provide showering facilities.  Also well maintained and clean
5248,"As I do not require this facility I didn’t check, but I’m informed by the ground they have an accessible toilet "
5249,We parked round the corner in S. College Street with blue badge.
5250,Listening to the wildlife. How peaceful the environment was. The Cafe at the Model village.
5251,"Access in and around the building:  Getting around the building was good as there are bright wide corridors. The restaurant and bar were well laid out with good contrasting colours. Lifts were large and also went down to the swimming pool, gym and car park levels.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible rooms were bright and spacious. Fitted with alarm cords and deaf alter pillow alarms.  Access in the dining area:  The dining area is large but there is a logical route in and staff will help you find a table.  Access to other facilities:  The reception was to the left as I went in. The desk is equipped with a hearing loop."
5252,"I stayed here on the recommendation of Euan’s Guide and i was not disappointed.  From the automatic doors to the accessible reception desk. I was not pleased to open the door to the rooms corridor with a pull towards you locked door but once inside the room i was really pleased to see the room and its low bed and fantastic comfortable wet room with loads of space for transfers and the shower chair had anti slip on it. Plenty of emergency cords all reaching the ground and there was one by the bed too. My only criticism would be down to the width of the corridor, when we went to check out the cleaners trolleys were in the corridor which meant I couldn’t get past due to the corridor being so narrow. They had to pull then into a room to allow me to pass."
5253,"From the car park it is all on the one level, plenty of room for a wheelchair or a mobility scooter. Some of the rides in the fairground don’t have disabled access but that would be quite difficult to do!"
5254,"Level access cafe, work shops performance space."
5255,I was very pleasantly surprised by how much thought has been given to wheelchair users on the boat. They have obviously gone out of their way to make every single part of the tour accessible and have even made sure there are disabled toilets aboard. Even the tightest spaces were cleverly made to take wheelchairs and the staff were very willing to help. The tour itself was interesting (the furnishings were a lot less grand than I expected). All in all a very enjoyable day out.
5256,Great disabled toilet
5257,There is a decent sized accessible loo. There are contrasting grab rails around toilet. Toilet is right side transfer but you'd need to move two bins out of the way. The toilet is not locked. There is a hand dryer but I didn't see any coat hooks. There is enough space to turn in a powerchair and a carer could fit in too however there is no changing place toilet. 
5258,"All the shops and restaurants had flat level entrance thresholds, all the shops I used appeared to have lifts. "
5259,"Recently went to Stoke to visit family, this hotel has 2 accessible rooms I stayed in room 106. The hotel is fully accessible and the staff are eager to please. If you are visiting this area I would recommend this hotel."
5260,"STS Lord Nelson is a custom designed ship to support the integration of disabled and non-disabled sailors alike. The accessible features on board, coupled with the enthusiastic nature of the staff and volunteers, makes for a terrific and unique experience. No two voyages are the same and this review is a summary review of all my experiences on board.   Features include four accessible toilets on board (two on deck and two 'down below), numerous bed hoists and height-adjustable beds, stair lifts throughout to all levels, height-adjustable tables and chairs, wheelchair ascender devices (to support wheelchair users to climb the mast), tactile markings, audio compass, hearing loops, and clear signage (I've probably forgotten something!). As well as all of that, the deck layout of the ship is designed so that every 'job' on board is accessible at wheelchair user height.   I found that the staff and volunteers on board have a 'can do' attitude and people focus on what you can do rather than what you can't. I've seen everyone from wheelchair users and quadruple amputees climb the mast, along with visually impaired and hearing impaired people too. I love the JST experience as it made me feel truly free.  This isn't a sailing 'holiday' as you're part of running the ship, so you're involved with everything from helming and sail setting to cooking and cleaning. Not for the faint hearted or for those who love sitting by a pool!   One thing worth noting - and the reason it's 4.5/5 and not 5 - is that neither of the JST's ship can accommodate power chairs at present. "
5261,Difficult but perfectly manageable. Staff are happy to provide assistance and are very accommodating. 
5262,"The Centre is a bit off the beaten track but there is a lovely big car park with plenty of disabled bays, and public transport is also good (bus/Dial-a-bus &  Handicabs)."
5263,Changing place fully equipped 
5264,One disabled parking space in the small carpark in front of reception is not ideal. Plenty of parking is available in the main carpark but it is a short walk away from reception. If you are booked into the Keep there are 2 more disabled spaces outside the front door.
5265,"Great Museum in an iconic place in the middle of Edinburgh's city centre with great views towards Princess Gardens. With Accessible main entrance, the whole museum is in the same level having a fair space in between walls and corridors making it easier for everybody to visit it. The museum also has Accessible toilets. Worth to be visited."
5266,"Parking is tricky - there is limited single yellow line parking on the high street, although there are some disabled parking bays opposite the parliament,  outside the Queens Gallery (and failing that there is a decent car park at the start of Holyrood Park. A couple of buses go down the Royal Mile."
5267,"Great service from lovely staff in a reasonably accessible venue.   Please note this review is of the main building, not 'The Stables'."
5268,"Reasonably easy to access via public transport (either by bus or by train into Exhibition Centre). Finding the door in is a bit of an issue, but once you find it you're fine. "
5269,"On arriving it was easy to get in via the large automated glass doors. The reception has a dropped area and the routes around the building well signposted. It was great to be able to explore the unexpected areas like the rooftop viewing point. A lift, escalator or stairs takes you to the different levels. There was plenty of circulation space around the different galleries and exhibits."
5270,"This cafe is very popular and we recommend booking in advance where possible otherwise you may have to sit outside - it can be breezy but fleece blankets are provided. The food is terrific including local fresh dressed crab and a home made 'local catch' fish soup which comes with an optional slug of sherry and brandy infused peppers - delicious! Very friendly staff, the disabled parking is slightly undulating for lifts but doable. The cafe is on the beach which is handy for dogs."
5271,A couple of disabled bays and on-street parking available on streets nearby.
5272,Portable baby changing table (which can be removed by staff on request) restricts space a little.
5273,Easy access disabled toilets and wet rooms
5274,All staff attentive and helpful.
5275,"If you’re in York- don’t miss this! Absolutely lovely little place, amazing staff, and the best cup of tea I had in York! Very easy access"
5276,"I think it's pretty level access to get in. There's an upper level, which I'm fairly sure is serviced by a lift although I didn't go up so I can't comment on the size of the lift.  The thing that stood out to me was that they had a till with a lowered counter for wheelchair users, which I thought was brilliant!"
5277,Welcomed my service dog
5278,"The staff we saw were helpful and friendly, especially in and around the courtyard. Didn't seen many staff though other than that. The campsite is largely unattended at weekends. Didn't see a soul!"
5279,The restaurant has a reasonable sized car park. There are no designated disabled parking bays.
5280,"4 self-catering holiday cottages (3 cottages x 2 twin/ double bedroom plus lounge double sofa bed - sleeps 6, and 1cottage  x 4 twin/ double bedrooms - sleeps 8) with level access entry, mobility scooter charging area in porch, 'H'-frame ceiling tracker hoists in wet-floor shower room and bedroom(s), Clos-o-Mat toilets in 2 cottages, drop level work surface/ breakfast bar in kitchen, spacious open plan lounge/ kitchen/ dining area, electric profiling bed.

5281,I travelled on Coach so couldnt comment on the parking 
5282,One of the entrances to the building was good but the other entrance accessibility was poor.
5283,"On arrival, a member of staff went out of his to a) point out access b) get as map of the venue c) get a  free wheelchair d) point out suitable cafe (of the two). He was extremely helpful and pleasant. The exhibits were well laid out an easily accessible."
5284,"We loved visiting the distillery as this was one of the rare places that you could become so absorbed in the visit that you forgot about the day to day perils of being a wheelchair user or have a sight impairment. Those bits were all covered off with a platform lift to get to the stills, a lift to go up to the tasting room. The guide leading the way and explaining the stories of the whisky process and the exhibits to hand. Be it a sniff of the horns to capture a whisky aroma, a peek into the doocot to see a precious barrel or a stroll up to the Gin Cottage to see the marvels of gin production.  The visit started on an excellent footing as the doors were swung open and a warm welcome as we were greeted by a guide. A clear explanation of what was to be seen and the layout set us up for a good visit. We ventured off on a tour and were soon captivated by the stories, sights and smells.   Unusually, this was not a glimpse from the distance to see the beauty of the copper stills as a sizeable platform lift took me and my chair up to see the whisky process up close, from big mash tuns, to the stills and the slow flowing of the heads of the spirit I got to see it all.  A short distance away we entered the blending room / tasting room where a wee dram could be sampled - driving as I was I opted to take away my dram for later!  The distillery had a surprise in store for us as we expected the whisky side of things but were delighted to be able to go to the adjacent 'Gin Cottage' - literally what it says - a cottage carefully converted to house the gin production. The gin distilling and the copper was fascinating and whilst being a tool was indeed a work of art. Here too was an opportunity for a tasting; so one more sample to take away.   Our tour ended in the spacious shop where there were lots of bottles and associated gifts and wares to purchase. From here we couldn't resist the temptation of the cafe. Very spacious with moveable furniture and the option of a patio we settled for coffee and admired the 'oh so tempting' menu!"
5285,Every member of staff was friendly and helpful.
5286,There is an accessible toilet with all the features you would expect to find.
5287,Full marks for the parking arrangements. Large clear signs directed us to the accessible parking area just beyond the Visitor Information Point in the 'Rangers House' and parking with plenty of space to deploy the vehicle ramp and get out. 
5288,"We could park outside our room, but no marked disabled space and slopes to negotiate to get to main bit of hotel. A step in main corridor."
5289,"The building is fully accessible on ground floor level, with no steps and a ramp to the side for wheelchairs/pushchairs.  The doors leading into the building are automatic. There was excellent signage guiding customers to the café and toilet facilities, also the in store customer services desk, there were staff on hand for assistance if required.  In the café there was an induction loop clearly indicated at the café till, there are disabled priority seating at a couple of tables in the café, with sufficient space, these are located close to the till area and leading to the main Foodhall shopping area."
5290,The loo is clean but the proportions are tight as is the corridor on which it is situated. However Coffee #1 has done their best given the restrictions of an old building.
5291,Level access throughout. A friendly atmosphere within renovated church building
5292,"This is a great pub, with excellent food and drink and truly helpful and friendly staff who go out of their way to try and make things easier, such as taking a chair away from a table without being asked.  The toilet is large and well equipped - which makes life a lot easier.   Access to the pub is available via the front and the rear -  no steps but the front entrance may be a little narrow for larger chairs or powerchairs, but the rear has a double door and a ramp.  The only downside is the parking - it's a small car park and a very popular pub - the last time I went at the weekend someone blocked my door to my car even though we were parked in a disabled space."
5293,"There was a lift and staff to escort us to access the state rooms. Everyone was very kind and helpful. There are very few places to sit down - Mum has a rollator with a seat so she was ok, but the rest of us were often left standing."
5294,"We have used this venue at one of our events with the group of 16 people. The staff was very friendly and helpful straight from beginning. Food was good, service was fast and the facilities were clean and spacious. There was no problem with paying separate bills and the staff even helped with taking photos."
5295,Plenty of off street parking just outside the club house. No  Blue badge needed.  Parking is free.
5296,La Boheme can be found on the promenade at El Arenal Beach and there are a variety of disabled parking spaces behind the El Arenal Beach area. You will usually find one which is free even in high season. You can walk or drive closer to the promenade at the front down a variety of side roads and walkways. It is a really flat wide area with plenty of space.
5297,Car park is not really suited for wheelchairs but staff will try their best to direct you to somewhere more convenient if you ask. Buses do stop nearby but it is quite a rural location.
5298,"Big toilet, a little bit messy when I visited. Didn’t notice an emergency cord beside the toilet - sink and hand dryer were at a mid height which was good. This doubles up as a baby change space."
5299,There were changing place toilets 
5300,"The restaurant is entirely on one floor (the fourth floor), and is serviced by a lift. Although the main entrance gives you a daunting set of stairs, there is a second lift next to it which takes you directly into the main restaurant. Plenty of space to move around in a standard wheelchair."
5301,Helpful staff are on hand to assist with seating and other general information.
5302,Easy access via permanent ramps. Roomy lifts.
5303,Privately owned pay and display parking nearby but no disabled parking. However on street parking available. Not too far from public transport.
5304,"A wheelchair accessible location, reasonable food and service. Stunning views."
5305,They do have car park with disabled spaces but to enter venue is down hill from car park so assistance is possibly required.
5306,"Excellent, Helpful, Friendly"
5307,"Both the café and shop are easily accessible with the café being level with a large entrance, and the shop having two ramps, with large spaces and level flooring however some food items are on higher shelves which may be harder to access, but the staff are friendly and more than happy to help, some signage such as the boards behind the counters may be hard to see/read, the café board may also be hard to read, and no alternative menu formats are available. "
5308,There are barriers to get through but there is usually a member of staff at the wider gate which is usually open.  Some platforms are level access.   Others have a steep ramp or lift.  The lift is quite far from the platform and at one side there is a step.  the lift is 16 person but quite small.  There are tactile paving close to the edge of the platform.  There are help buttons at each platform.  
5309,"Ever so helpful and plentiful. they also take no offence if you say no thanks I will manage. Lots of food and beverage places with food and drink, haven't seen a bar mind, sold at the enharnsted rate you would expect in such a place."
5310,Plenty of space; Kitchen work surfaces raise and lower
5311,"This is a gtreat place even more so if you have children. They have a great fenced in play area which is only accesable through the resturant. They also have a really good deli, a little shop and a great micro brewery all under one roof. The food is good and there is loads of space. It should be a spectacular review and it would be if they could get the service right. I have been twice now and the service is amateurish. To sit you down and not give you a drinks menu is a schoolboy error. The staff spend most of their time by the kitchen which is out of sight from the main dining area. They forget a lot of stuff. For example half our drinks order (once we were finally able to place one). On my first visit they didn't tell me that they had no fish and chips until half an hour after I had ordered it!  If they could get the service right I would give it ten out of ten."
5312,The toilet at the main entrance was not suitable for mobility scooters. The other accessible loo was a portaloo which was walk in only.
5313,"There is an large accessible toilet to the left when entering the main entrance, by the lift. It was spacious with grab rails and emergency cord (sorry no photo)."
5314,"The main barrier to accessibility here is the cobble stones and dirt ground that are found at various locations around the Alhambra. These are hazardous if you are unsteady on your feet or you use a wheeled mobility aid. The larger the cobble stones the rougher the ride. Seating was very limited too. The route shown on the Alhambra map that you can get from the entrance or online is really the only route you can take if you can’t climb stairs.   But none of it is possible if you can’t walk or wheel over cobble stones and uneven ground.   I annotated a map and attached it as a photo and then described the route I took below in the order I took it.  To Nasrid Palace - At the beginning of the path is a section of large cobble stones (c. 50m) and benches. We followed the route through the Medina gardens which were beautiful and offered more views of the wider area. The gardens themselves had some steps to access them off the main path. Onwards past the church is a downhill section, which brought me to some canons. The views from here were also spectacular. However there was no dropped curb up onto the cobbled path from which to take in the views. So I had to go towards the Puerta de Justicia to get the ramp up on to it. Beyond that were the toilets, which were surrounded by more large cobble stones. From the cobbles there was a dirt path to the ticket checkpoint for Nasrid Palace.  In Nasrid Palace - This was the highlight of the visit for me. I asked a steward where I needed to go and she told me that we could jump to the front of the queue at our allotted time (entrance to this is pre-bookable only). From there we were escorted down a ramp, which I can only describe as like being on a horse. The anti-slip strips were big and I was bouncing up and down. We were taken into the Palace through a separate entrance with ramps. Once inside I was able to move through the one way system nicely on the scooter. Some of the side rooms were only accessible by flights of five or so steps so I got up and walked around one of them. There was still a lot to see without going in those rooms. We were guided by friendly staff through a separate accessible route. All in all I was impressed by how much I could access given the age and delicate nature of the building. I nearly drove into a water feature that was recessed into the floor. I can see why they dont allow pushchairs. Im sure I missed out on seeing some other areas of the Palace but I was satisfied on the day.  To the Generalife gardens - note that there is no step-free access to the Palace along the garden route shown on the map. There is a flat dirt avenue with more spectacular views. From there the route passes across the amphitheater to the toilets and then up a steep ramp to the garden level. Once at the entrance to the gardens, cobble stones begin. However, the stones are small, tightly packed and mostly even so I was able to scoot over them without much vibration. In the garden there are many benches to sit on and admire the trees, herbs and wildflowers, and the water features. At the end of the garden there are flights of steps to the Palace but no ramps. I really enjoyed this area.  To the Generalife Palace - the first part of the wide dirt road up to the Palace is steep and long, and leads to a narrow long flat section of large cobble stones. It was a rough. I don’t recall there being any seating along the way. Once at the Palace, I found a member of staff to let me in through a separate entrance. Once inside the door, the access stops there. I could still see the amazing architecture and water features from here. There are a few small individual steps from that point around the ground floor and I was able to walk around a little to look at the views out of the arches. We saw the Nasrid Palace and Alcazaba below which was quite spectacular. The space is tight with lots of people so it would be a challenge in a wheelchair, if you were able to overcome the steps. To get to other levels there are also lots of steps. I think if my time had been limited I would have thought the effort to get there wasn’t worth it.  I didn’t record anything about aids for hearing or seeing. The maps and signposts were not all that helpful because the route is different for disabled people. You can pay extra for an audio guide."
5315,"Great access throughout, big ramp down into the entrance, lifts available, ramps used throughout the building. The Hockney was on one level, throughout the exhibition and seats where provided in the rooms."
5316,"The outdoor cinema is located on grass next to Glamis Castle  and is very spacious. Around the grass there is a slight concrete border that you have to get up to get on to the grass, this is manageable to get up though. People bring their own chairs to the outdoor cinema and even though they had food vans (which I didn't visit), you are also able to bring your own food and drink.  From what I can tell you can see the movie screen from any of the seating areas on the grass. I don't know if the organisers offer subtitled movies but it would be great if they did."
5317,"I managed to get my powercycle (wheelchair with a cycle attachment out front) so if I managed to get in here, most would! Sadly the loo is not accessible though some people might manage it (it is at least on the ground floor and fairly centrally sited). The garden too is accessible. We had tea and cakes - absolutely delicious."
5318,"There is parking nearby in the Holyrood Park car park, and also at Duddingston Kirk. There was no nearby public transport."
5319,"Although the building is over 100 years old, everything possible has been done to make this venue accessible to everyone. The staff have obviously been trained to offer help to guests who have disability & do so in a kind & professional way. We only visited the ballroom, but found lifts & ramps were available as were radar key operated accessible loos."
5320,"Not sure if there is an accessible toilet downstairs, i just used the one in my room. it was a bit tight but i managed to squeeze my wheelchair in there."
5321,Staff were really good and quietly moved tables and made space for us once they spotted us coming in. Our group had two powerchair users.
5322,"It is on the level, but basic toilet, very clean and well looked after. We saw no grab rails or pull cord"
5323,really helpful
5324,Disabled parking outside entrance.  On bus route.
5325,"Exceptional; easy to find, easy to use, decent size and clean."
5326,We could not enter via the Spa entrance due to large box stair this was the first of many disappointments
5327,"Paid parking to the front of the Cafe ( on street ). Bus stop not far away, and a big off road car park near to the bus stop. I have parked my car in front of the Cafe."
5328,Generally perfectly accessible with staff willing to do all they can to help. 
5329,The train journey was really relaxing and there was some lovely scenery. I also learnt a lot of information as it was interactive and hands on.
5330,The owner is very warm and full of fun. He made us feel completely welcome and at ease. He was incredibly informative and it was great to hear his stories and interesting facts. 
5331,We asked for help at the information desk. A combination of ramps and lifts. We were escorted along back corridors which was interesting in itself. The only problem came at the entrance to the Central Lobby which was too narrow for my chair so I had to get up while my husband semi-collapsed it and pushed it through. The cafe had 2 tables giving priority to customers with disabilities.
5332,"The reserve is well signed , there is no lift but access to the reception, cafe and toilets is all on the flat and the doors are wide. There is an electric scooter for hire if you book it before your trip."
5333,You need to travel by car due to the location.  There are a good number of blue badge spaces (12) though it will get busy especially at weekends. There's a hefty charge to park and blue badges are not exempt. NT members park free. The surface is firm. Blue badge spaces are closest to the entrance but it's still some way to walk/wheel.
5334,Very large car park which has wheelchair friendly lift access
5335,"From the restrictions of a theatre in london, the accessible toliet was fine easily fit a wheelchair if needed."
5336,"Lots of disabled parking, which to access you need to show your blue badge in order to cross the barrier. "
5337,"Very friendly and helpful staff, nothing was a problem!"
5338,"This review refers to the Prêt at 93-95 Victoria Street, opposite the Albert pub.  There is a big step at the entrance and a doorbell for assistance. The doorbell was not working. I waited outside for several minutes. Horrible. "
5339,"This was my first time to watch Edinburgh Rugby club, a first to watch a non-international at Murrayfield and a first to watch a match with a friend using a Powerchair. Overall a very accessible venue with excellent staff!"
5340,The car park at Alsop station (there's no longer a station there) is sizeable. No blue badge spaces but loads of room. No charge for blue badge holders. Grid reference SK1550 5497. It's off the main road but nothing else there so you probably need own transport.
5341,"The whole RSC site is fully accessible, ramps and steps to the RST and Swan theatres."
5342,"They are operating a ‘safe as possible’ COVID system where they have a small(but wheelchair accessible) reception area, and we were greeted by Emily "
5343,High bar. Room for chair to manoeuvre but two side of seats against wall/window are high bar stools/banquette
5344,Staff were lovely on arrival. Very efficient and helpful.
5345,"A great big castle at the top of the town. Great views for miles around. Lots of rooms and displays to see, including costumed staff. Audio guide available in multiple languages. All outdoor space is cobbled so be careful. Limited parking but a bus train available from town centre but not suitable for wheelchairs 🙁. Ice cream van and cafe 😁. "
5346,"Clean, wide, and plentiful!"
5347,Very accessible with plenty open space to move around. Entrance is via ramped access with double doors and Lift access to all floors makes this a very pleasurable experience!
5348,"Amazing. We walked in through automatic doors, into a large, wide open space. From here, we could look at freestanding maps to get our bearings and set off on a trail around the highly interactive exhibits. Downstairs I was delighted to see Braille guides to the exhibit ahead, Braille interpretation on everything I could see, audio headsets and BSL interpretation on all videos that I came across. Heading back out there was a Changing Places toilet tucked around a quiet spot behind the massive staircase in the centre of the entrance hall. A sign informs you that there are 84 steps to climb, so if you have difficulty walking far you can decide if this is too high a climb for you or not. The lifts were clearly signed.   Upstairs, we were met with yet more alternative interpretation formats - and some fantastic tactile displays. You are encouraged to touch most exhibits and little green stickers with a hand symbol indicate this throughout. Wide corridors between displays, interactive features at a good height and lots of opportunity to read more information about everything on display. It was very busy with it being the weekend though!"
5349,The museum has two toilets and one is designated disabled but the other one is actually large enough for a wheelchair as well as a clean well presented and perfectly suitable.
5350,"The large car park for Longparke is situated beside the building and has 3 accessible parking spaces right outside the entrance. The ground of the car park is covered in grey gravel which was challenging for my powerchair, especially in thicker areas. Luckily, beside the accessible parking spaces there was paved slabs at eithers sides of the space. This is great because it’s a smoother surface for people to transfer to their wheelchairs, walk on or drive on. Unfortunately, though I exit my car from the back where there’s no paved slabs but, I managed to drive through the gravel and get on to the slabs. If there were no accessible spaces available wheelchair users may struggle to visit because of the gravel all around the other spaces, also parking spaces aren’t marked so there’s the problem of others parking too close. Accessible parking isn’t easily sign posted when you first enter the car park but, it’s usually near entrances so that’s where we headed.  Dobbies Garden Centre is beside Longparke and there is a bus stop there. However, when you walk from Dobbies to Longparke, you would struggle to cross over the road because there is no dipped kerb. You would also need to walk up the road to Longparke because there is no pavement. The same problem would also occur with the gravel in the car park. If you walked to Longparke from the main road I feel wheelchairs especially, would get stuck in the gravel. "
5351,The lady who owns the cafe and gift shop always makes us feel welcome.
5352,"I arrived from the street side of the Mound and had used a Lothian bus to get there. Great service, as all the buses have low floor level access and powered ramps that the driver puts down at the touch of a button. The Galleries are also right next door to one of Edinburgh's new tram stops; again a great accessible service."
5353,"The staff here are really amazing. They have always been very helpful with access, opening doors and clearing any spaces. They are all really friendly and soft spoken, they always make me feel at ease. They ask permission if they would like to move the wheelchair once I am out of it, and offer to put bags on my wheelchair or in my backpack on the back, which I always appreciate. Rhu is always amazing, he has been so understanding of concerns around COVID and talks through everything. The staff change their gloves if they need to open any doors or drawers, and everything is wiped down in between patients. The staff are supportive and never patronising, checking ability and listening to what I say. I feel confident going in without a carer as I know if I needed assistance that staff are able and willing to help, I can transfer independently. "
5354,All very helpful particularly the front desk 
5355,the staff done what had to be done
5356,"A 'miles without stiles' ramble. If you love being out in the wilds but need a structured route this is for you, anything from a pushed wheelchair to an off road scooter will cope with it. Don't be tempted to cross the grass from the car park as the route sugests, even my off road scooter struggled. Go up the road to the track. It's a full on ramble, you need to be aware of the weather and no public transport but it's worth the effort."
5357,"This is a review of the Stanley Kubrick exhibition which is on until 15 September 2019. On this visit I only visited the Kubrick exhibition but there is lots to see on other floors which are accessible by lift.   The Design Museum relocated to its current building in 2016. It's housed in the re-furbished Commonwealth Institute building, which I'm old enough to remember, and the museum has excellent access.  My overall visit was extremely positive, as generally access was easy and the exhibition was amazing. However I did speak to staff about access and that is why this review is quite detailed about the small things that could be improved on."
5358,Plenty parking spaces adjacent to the hotel.
5359,Up the ramp at the visitors centre and round the back. Wasn't the smartest but pretty good.
5360,Street parking on double yellows outside (but OK with blue badge). Bit tricky to get onto the pavement.
5361,"Everyone we chatted with had lots of knowledge, were extremely enthusiastic and friendly."
5362,Very helpful
5363,New facility so loos first class for all users with plenty of space
5364,"There isn't a wheelchair accessible toilet, the toilet door looked slim and I don't think it would have been big enough for my powerchair, but we didn't check so can't say for sure. It may be suitable for manual wheelchair users"
5365,"For the non driver, the City has one of the most frequent and additional needs, access buses. All with extending platforms, drop down floors with wheelchair and mobility seating. With this being the Main Street in Edinburgh’s Ne Town, the are buses in either direction every 2 minutes, from this cafe 50m from the tram stop 300m. As with any old city parking is limited but there is blue badge, pay bay parking in nearby Charlotte Square. If you are visiting Edinburgh from elsewhere by car, drive to the nearest park and ride and if your Scottishand very a certain age your pass is free, there are a range of fares which are day savers an hour of parking charge equals a day saver, unlimited throughout the City for 24h."
5366,"Great point to stop off for a picnic, stroll or even just a loo stop. There is a small Cabin here too to get a drink. Decent sized and clean accessible loo. There is free parking for Blue Badge holders. And - the main attraction - the Loch is accessible from the car park. It's sort of level access with a few bumps... And a kind of dirt path to the water's edge."
5367,"A small, quiet, stunning, boutique style hotel in Corfu Town centre. The hotel is accessible to some people with mobility disabilities. The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful. It was pleasure to stay here. Loved it, loved it, loved it."
5368,"Whilst staying in Washington DC we hired an adapted vehicle that was wheelchair accessible and drove over the Potomac river to Arlington Cemetery. The journey to the cemetery was not easy. Driving on the right side of the road and a lot of one way systems made it challenging but the main problem was the lack of signage to the cemetery. We must have crossed the Potomac several in our attempt to get to the cemetery. We did finally get there. On arrival we inquired about disabled parking. There were plenty of disabled spaces.  There are other ways to travel to Arlington Cemetery including .... The metro. The Arlington National Cemetery Station is located on the Metropolitan Washington D.C. Area Metrorail's Blue Line.  There is also a Metrobus stop on Memorial Avenue. Information on the hours of operation, schedules and fares for the Metrorail and Metrobus are available on the WMATA website.   Both are just a short walk from Arlington gates. "
5369,"We booked a private tour by car.  The driver loaded/unloaded and pushed my wheelchair which made the trip very easy.  There was also an option of a wheelchair accessible vehicle, but this was not available at the time of our visit"
5370,"The toilets are Radar-key operated, which cuts down on misuse, but queues are still common. The 'accessible' toilets vary in size, and the entry to the sole accessible toilet on Court 1 is off the corridor to the rest of the toilets which makes getting in and out and waiting problematic. When I visited the emergency cord had been tucked behind the pipes, so I left a Euan's Guide card explaining how it operated and needed to be maintained."
5371,"I wouldn't drive here are the on-street parking isn't good. The buses are good however, and it's close to York Place tram stop!"
5372,I didn't use it but there is no option on this form to say so.
5373,The toilet is fitted suitably for most disabled needs and it was reasonably clean. The floor was wet due to a dripping tap. The door was difficult to manouver and latch. These toilets have not been substantially improved for 25 years and look very uninviting.
5374,An accessible toilet is off the main shopping aisle.  Large enough for power chair.
5375,"Excellent roomy Restaurent. With level access, good large disabled toilet. Excellent food and great staff."
5376,Very friendly and accommodating 
5377, Most of the staff are extremely helpful and obliging  especially those who helped get the wheelchair on and off  the trolley bus.   Unfortunately as usual there was one who was a little reluctant to help.
5378,Took the Flytoget train from Oslo airport - great system with inbuilt ramps at the wheelchair section and a very helpful conductor who seemed to magically appear at the right moment.  The train arrived at Oslo station which was connected via a shopping centre to the hotel.
5379,"I went to see Kinky Boots at the Adelphi, and it was an excellent experience. Right from the start, the box office knew exactly what I was after from the wheelchair + companion tickets (which were reasonably priced) and asked if I wanted a wheelchair space or the opportunity to transfer into a seat at the end of a row. The stalls don't have any stairs - just gently sloping aisles - plus there was an excellent disabled loo and pleasant, well-trained staff. So nice not to have any hassles and just to be able to relax and enjoy a good show. "
5380,No step access from car to tills! Easy access with excellent ramps and large doors for easy access.
5381,"Automatic doors, low counter, standard wheelchair accessible toilet. The board listings on the wall for the food and drinks have very big writing on them, and the menus have a clear font. No obvious braille or large print alternative, though. The seating at the tables are hard wood with high backs, there is also lounge seating that are low chairs by coffee tables. "
5382,"The Grange was built in 1900 by Joseph Hinks, a lamp manufacturer from Birmingham, and with his wife Francis, had seven children. Joseph and his father James ran their lamp business from 91 Great Hampton street. During 1900 he leased land, and at a rather high cost, built Chesford Grange, and the family lived here until 1908. The new owner, Lord Algeron Malcolm Arthur Percy, who later became an MP.  bought the Grange for his daughter Katherine Percy, who in 1904 had married Josceline Reginald Heber-Percy. (Interesting, we have just reviewed the village of Hodnet in Shropshire for you all, which belonged to another part of the Heber-Percy family line ) The second son of the 6th Duke of Northumberland, Lord Algeron Percy had married lady Victoria Edgecombe in 1880, and he remained an MP until 1887, when he decided to make his home at Guys Cliffe his permanent home. His only son, also a Algeron Percy, who would inherit Guys Cliffe, was killed at the battle of Jutland in 1916, and later, his daughter Katherine, moved from Chesford Grange, so as to be able to look after her aged parents. Following the death of her father, Katherine inherited Guys Cliffe in 1933.  So by late 1924 Henry Pratt became the owner of Chesford Grange, and the family lived here until 1938. Later that year, the Hames family lived here, and with lots of hard work, following a period of time that the house had been left empty and uninhabited, the family lived in part of the Grange, while successfully developing other areas as a hotel and restaurant. During the Second World War, the department of war took over the house. It later  became a borstal institute, before becoming a hotel again, and it is known that by 1956 a mr Richardson was running the hotel. The Grange then changed hands a number of times over the next few years, until recently bought over by the Qhotels group.  OUR REVIEW. (THE PHOTOS WE SHOW MAKE THE HOTEL LOOK BETTER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS ) We were very disappointed to see that Qhotels group have done next to nothing to improve the exterior areas of this Grange, it’s just as we last reviewed it, and in need of a make over, and that applies also to the interior areas, it’s much the same old, same old. Certainly nothing seems to have been done to improve things for disabled, it is still hard work to get around to certain areas of the hotel.  What was once a lovely old building, but now badly in need of repair work and painting, it’s such a shame to see the place in the state it is in (photo 1) but photo  makes it look much better than it is, close inspection of photo will show you what we  mean.  There are three disabled bays available (photo 2) by the front entrance, and a brick ramp leads to the front door, a push and pull entry (3) on the level now. A wide reception area which is quite light and airy (4) and a warm welcome from staff.  Round the corner, a plain well stocked bar (5) with an entry that leads into a cafe like casual eating area. (6). We sat in a small lounge area with room for wheelchair (7) and next to this a corridor that leads to public toilets (8) but no disabled toilet seen. These are plain usual ordinary toilets (9). A nice stone fireplace with a few more comfortable seating opposite the bar (10). Leads into a very plain Lino tiled flooring were you can enjoy a light lunch or hot drinks, while over looking the terrace and gardens (11). For disabled to get to terrace, leave the bar and go down the ramp (photo 12) and then around a number of tight corners on the ramp, which will lead you into the restaurant (13) which is very plain, unappealing (14). A doorway ahead leads to the terrace (15) with Rattan seating, very pleasant area to sit while enjoying the sun trap (16).  To reach the lovely shaded garden there are steps (17) and impossible for chairs. To get back into restaurant, there are unkempt steps (18) or retrace your steps through restaurant and follow ramp and it’s turns.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS It’s a disappointing shame that it’s not a looked after property, as it’s a comfortable old place so such a shame to see it neglected."
5383,"There are no disabled toilets. I couldn't even get near the ladies toilet in my chair due to the bar and sound booth creating a narrow space. Even if I had, the cubicles and washing area are tiny: I struggled with a stick. I think the men's was back down several flights of stairs, so we didn't see them."
5384,Reception staff very friendly
5385,Wonderful historic building. Magna Carta. Beautiful grounds. Delicious cake!
5386,All the staff are well trained  to  assist you with  all your requirements.
5387,Very friendly staff very pleasant and approachable. 
5388,The museum is a little out of the centre of town - we got a cab. There are different types of taxis some of which are more spacious than others!
5389,Level access wide automatic doors & large lift to all levels
5390,Curb edges are too high onto the walkway.
5391,"The accessible loos were good once you found them. Although they has the stick out style signs these were not always obvious from a wheelchair height. In the main concourse on the upper level there was one accessible toilet. Others were in the avenue between the upper consource and the viewing areas. These were not so obvious as you passed by. Some signage by the entrance to this avenue area would improve this greatly. Once inside the loos were fine with space to move, good grab rails and what you'd expect to find as a wheelchair user."
5392,Very friendly and helpful. They live on site and can be contacted anytime.
5393,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
5394,"A slight slope up to the door which might make access a bit tricky if the staff were not as alert and helpful as they always are. They see you coming and open the door for you,"
5395,Great place to visit Wheel chair friendly. Has a changing place room With hoist changing table. Every where was wheel chair accessible. No discount for cares but everything so good and a fair entrance price it does not matter
5396,You can easily access this cafe from the riverside car park or Eton station ordown the hill from the Windsor station.
5397,"Great access, automatic door from street, flexible seating, and accessible loo."
5398,Need a car to get here and then there is a gravelled parking area which was busy at the weekend but very quiet on the week day I visited. No spaces are marked so you can park away from others as though in a blue badge space. There is an information board which shows the disabled access walk information and map.
5399,"Accessible eaterie, friendly staff and accessible toilets. Highly recommended."
5400,"Wasnt very clear, far away from main streets "
5401,"Very good - level entrance, wide doors which helpful staff opened for us, and no internal steps."
5402,This was a real home away from home. All the equipment we have at home was there as arranged which made things very easy. The wet room was brilliant. The weather was great and we made good use of the garden and conservatory. The owners popped round on the first day to check we had everything we wanted and answered any questions we had which was a nice touch. Good location. Would definitely stay again
5403,The staff that we met were friendly and happy to chat and find out more about our visit.
5404,They were good and spacious.
5405,"The car park is level but there is a very steep hill up to the main door, I estimate it to be about a 1 in 4.  Once inside there is a platform lift up to the restaurant.  Access through the restaurant is good, some parts are narrow due to the layout of the seats."
5406,Staff are friendly and helpful
5407,Although access for me as a wheelchair user was not great I was encouraged by the information  made available on the ŵebsite and the ability to phone the Steward and get access to a tarmac walkway where you could look down on much of the site. By walking around the perimeter where you could you got some great views. You could also wheel through the main remaining archway which gave a feel for the scale of the Abbey.
5408,There is an alternative entrance at the back of the building which allows access for wheelchair users and those who may have difficulty walking up the steps at the main entrance. Lift access was good also. Great place.
5409,Mini Bus (Own)
5410,"Excellent disabled access, with automatic main doors. No steps or ramps. Lift to 1st floor cafe & plenty of space for a wheelchair, which are also available for customer use. Low level checkouts good for wheelchair users."
5411,Level Access
5412,"Quiet but friendly staff, offering advice, but no advantage to disabled."
5413,"There is a lift to take you to the accessible toilet which is downstairs. I remember that there was no problem with the toilet which was roomy and most of downstairs was dark, painted red and black."
5414,As previously mentioned access is pretty poor despite having the ramp outside it’s very small and difficult to manoeuvre around. The items are on high shelves that are difficult to read/reach from wheelchair height. The counter to pay is also very high up and with racks on the edge with more items for sale it’s very difficult to get the wheelchair close to hand over change/use the card machine.   Tables were okay to sit at but not much room for moving around as previously stated.  
5415,"Staff helpfully pointed me to the toilets but when I complained on return home, the park did not reassure me they would do anything to change the toilet provision this season. I recommended they meet the UK standards and also look at changing places because the floor was disgusting to lay down on."
5416,Accessible and very smart loos.
5417,"There is an NCP car park nearby and a further car park on Eccleston Bridge. It is possible to get assistance at short notice from the generally friendly platform staff if you want to travel by National Rail, even though Southern Rail advise you to book ahead a scandalous *24* (!!!) hours in advance for assistance.   The station is served by swarms of buses and is the terminus for many train services heading south of London. For the tube there is step-free access to all lines.   The Victoria Line is step-free from street to train. The District and Circle lines are step-free from street to platform, and manual boarding ramps are available, speak to staff at the ticket barrier before you travel, to seek ramp assistance for the District and Circle lines.   If you are sensitive to loud noise, be sure to cover your ears in lift 'E', where the announcements are ridiculously loud and shrill. "
5418,Old fashioned pub that serves food in Milltown. Wheelchair access to all areas and has an accessible bathroom.
5419,Staff were helpful and there was room in the cafe to get around with the wheelchair. 
5420,"They were ok, the lady I first spoke to seemed a little miffed to start with when she seen my wheelchair and thought she'd have to move all the stuff down to another table. The servers however were lovely.  Would have been nice to be told what each item was though."
5421,Our cottage had disabled access and ground floor bedroom and bathroom. The walk (or push) from the car park is slightly uphill. There was an electric raise and recline chair.
5422,The venue was busy during our visit it was however very easy to find a table and move a seat out of the road to let wheelchair access the table. The main passage along the ground floor was wide enough to let people pass the chair but people pushing there chairs out toto the bar etc. made it difficult at times. The venue does welcome assistance dogs 
5423,"No parking nearby.  No public parking in the old town at all, and I doubt there are many (if any) buses.  Everyone uses bicycles"
5424,"Had a browse around for a few hours on a sunny morning.  Well laid out, few gradients and signs near the lift requesting wheelchair etc priority.  Easy to read maps too"
5425,"Probably the worst part of my visit. The receptionist gave us a code which we were to use for gaining access to the toilet. I didn't really agree with this as it would've been tricky to enter the code on my own. The disabled toilets are in the middle of nowhere. When you get into the toilet you will see that there isn't a red cord! Why, why, why. For example, if I fell inside the toilet am I supposed to scream in the hope someone heard me? Really didn't understand the thought process on this one. First time inside Britain seeing no red cord in a disabled loo. Speechless."
5426,Great local curry restaurant. Does take away too. Big step to get in but they have a ramp.
5427,"Whilst the view of the Cerne Abbas giant was rather disappointing due to  him needing to be re-chalked access to viewing points was good.  Cerne Abbas village is ancient, with some properties dating from the 15th / 16th centuries But not much to view or hold attention.  However, there was a pleasant walk along the river side on hard earth tracks (suspect this could get very muddy in wet weather)  As the buildings were old, wheelchair access was not good. Entry St Mary's  church impossible - steps. Entry to The Royal Oak pub - impossible due to narrow door ways and steps. We managed to get to dinner by dismantling the wheelchair and  lifting  my husband inside, but lots of help offered.  Worth the effort - excellent meal in lovely pub with good staff Enjoyed!  Well worth a visit  - but take family  / friends to help. "
5428,"The accessible toilet is large enough to turn your wheelchair. As you may or may not be able to see from my poor picture the flush is on the side nearest the wall, it's a bit of a pet hate of mine but on the whole a nice clean toilet. There are grab rails if you need.  "
5429,"Parking is right by the lodge, but isn't flat so we kept having to use the flat parking areas to do wheelchair transfers and hoisting. Doesn't leave a lot of space by the car to get onto the ramp"
5430,Staff were very helpful at the main car park.
5431,no steps parking right outside
5432,"I took my oldest daughter as my carer. When we were trying to find the venue we found staff wandering around the local area promoting (Underbelly staff wear purple tshirts, the venues have purple entrances) so we asked for directions. The staff from that point on were attentive and knew what they were talking about which is always a plus. Once we got to the door we needed, (which were signposted with names of cows) I saw stairs and my heart sank. 2 members of staff saw us and told us that the access ramp was round the corner, it's actually a solid concrete slope rather than a mobility ramp and even that reassured me that access has been considered. The member of staff who escorted us to our seats took us through the door and round the back of the stage, it's pretty dark but the access is clear and the staff member led the way. When we got into the actual room they'd already worked out where to seat us so there was no fuss or panic. We were about 5 rows back and to be honest as the show started I was glas we were not closer to the stage as the action takes place on a screen suspended from the ceiling. My manual chair reclines but I didn't think about that and not everyone has that function.  When the performance started there were 4 people centre stage, a lady to one side on a computer and a 3 piece band on the other side of the stage. I had no idea what to expect and that's part of the Festival experience. Manual Cinema come from Chicago and at the end they took time to meet the audience and answer questions about their 'craft'. That's not something all performers do, but it's something I appreciate, I usually have questions and can't get answers. They actually didn't design the show with disabled awareness in mind, but it works. The screen being higher than heads means I could see everything without stretching or craning my neck. I didn't need to ask the people in front of me to move to accomodate me.   The stage is visible and the performers move around which adds something to 'just' the puppet type shadow work on the screen above, I was watching the 4 operators put the screen overlays on the overhead projectors to create the scenes and the people acting at the same time and then could see it all come together on the screen above. Very subtle and really effective. The lady operating the computer for lighting and effects sang too and her voice was lovely.  The musicians added drama and tempo nicely which is also great to watch. I saw Lula Del Ray which was a touching story about a girl's dreams and her relationship with her mum, her imagination and music. I like pieces which encourage thinking or self exploration so the style used was really effective for this. Puppetry is often seen as for kids, or passe, but there was something contemporary and fresh about their approach.  When the show was over again staff were efficient and helpful to make sure we were looked after, and the Venue Manager asked if everything had been what we'd expected as we left. To that point it all was.  Unfortunately, when I went to use the toilet after the show I found an area for improvement, the accessible toilet is small, I struggled to turn my manual chair to get in and out, on the way out the door and my chair had a fight 4 times before I was clear to get out. There is another toilet with a disabled sign, but it's a gents and there's no disabled toilets or adaptions to help. I did point this out to staff who were apologetic but not sure what solutions could be offered. The additional toilets in the quad outside have steps, they are portacabin style ones so I think there's potential to put an accessible one there. I'd be really concerned about taking a power chair or larger manual in to that toilet (mine is a 30"") but I was unable to find an alternative. "
5433,the surface is a dirt road but our group had varying disabled people present and no-one had any issues.
5434,I don't believe there is a parking area but cars are allowed to park in the side street. There are bus stops nearby.
5435,"Has a good sized car park right beside the pub, but public transport isn't the easiest around here. A good route to drive is around Holyrood Park at the bottom of Arthur's Seat."
5436,"Seating available, signs and voice over for trains, but see note about lift/elevator access. "
5437,"Level access onto station.  Ramps go down under the platforms to give access to other platforms. They are very steep but I saw another unaccompanied disabled person being helped on the ramps, with an arm to hold and his suitcase carried - so the staff are clearly able and willing to help.  I booked ramps on/off the train - staff were polite, punctual and offered my carer help with my wheelchair. On return, at midnight, two staff members met me and were so very helpful.  I've never been let down by Guildford (unlike Waterloo, sad to say!)."
5438,"There is lots of parking at Fort Kinnaird, although it can get very busy. There are designed accessible spaces near shop entrances. There are bus stops at Fort Kinnaird, Lothian 30, 49, 106 and 400 stop there. 108 and 118 Prentice Coaches also stop there. "
5439,I have only used the loo at Sheffield Park in the Bessemer arms but that was fine.
5440,All the toilets are in the adjoined AgeUK offices downstairs. The disabled toilet is accessible with no problems.
5441,"I went on the East Lancs Railway Steam Train between Bury and Rawtenstall. The staff and experience far exceeded my expectations. The access to the station is via a ramp once you have purchased your tickets and then for people unable to use the foot bridge, there is access (with help from) a member of staff across the track. The train has a lovely adapted wheelchair carriage with plenty of room. The guard asked me what I thought of the new carriage (which still has all of its original old character and smells) I thought it was amazing. In coming months they are adding further accessible carriages. There's not an accessible toilet on the train but there is at both Bury and Rawtenstall which were extremely clean. A thoroughly fantastic day :)"
5442,very good if you stick to paths but it is a park and large so if you have a scooter or borrow one of theirs (by arrangement) you have more scope to see the sculpture in the open air. cafe easily accessible and as are all the galleries. There are some exhibits you cannot take a chair into (the blue room) which is a shame
5443,Rude and uninterested.  They clearly didn't want us there and kept bashing my chair as they walked past.
5444,The restaurant is housed in a historic property. Only the tables in the outside courtyard is accessible for people with wheelchairs. There are 4 - 5 steps to the entrance. There is a handrail. Once inside the tables are pretty close together but the tables and chairs are movable.
5445,"We drove, plenty of designated accessible parking space outside the building, which are shared with Easterbrook Hall of which the Bistro and Spa are now part of . Very large carpark close by The Crichton Estate where the Bistro is located is served by local buses."
5446,"There's a car park with Blue Badge spaces (chargeable unless you're a NT member), cafe and small shop with accessible loo.  There's a choice of self guided walks (free guide/map from the cafe). The ""sailors walk"" has a surfaced path, easy for wheelchairs and scooters. There are lovely views across the punchbowl. If you have more robust wheels, there are lots of paths going off in lots of directions (take the map and just watch out on some of the uneven paths, which can be tricky).  The view from Gibbet Hill is great - lots of info boards give the history of the gruesome events that took place here and gave the hill it's name."
5447,Superb access and facilities both inside and out - highly recommended for a visit. A Moore/Rodin exhibition was showing at the time which was superb; exhibitions change at regular intervals and there is also a very good permanent collection worth seeing.
5448,"Understandably only certain cottages are available for dog owners. The complex faces a lake (fishing available) each cottage has a front patio area, with outdoor seating for warmer weather. The Main living area is open plan, kitchen with built in appliances and accessible from a wheelchair, a large dining table central with ample space all around it and lounge with TV. Everywhere was brightly decorated with extra special touches to make it homely and inviting. Brickhouse farm cottages provide another thoughtful and alternative option, something rarely found in this guise :- family members and carers together, I know from experience how special this type of holiday can be."
5449,The only possible way to visit friends near Alnwick was to find fully accessible accommodation for myself and my husband who uses a wheelchair. The Hogshead seemed to cover most of our needs.
5450,"Both floors are accessible to wheelchairs. There is a large lift. Automatic doors make life so much easier. Although there are some steps in the garden, there is also a wheelchair route. Admittedly part of this was closed due to the weather, but it was still possible to get outside & enjoy the fresh air & stunning views."
5451,The accessible toilet is a reasonable size but it is missing a vertical grab rails so it is difficult to stand up if you have balance problems like I do! 
5452,Generally good - and most are equipped with alarms.
5453,"This path connects St Leonard's / Newington area to Duddingston / Craigmillar. It can be quite hard to find, particularly if you start at the entrance near Holyrood Park. To enter from this side you are looking for East Parkside Road, there is then a turn off to houses and garages called Innocent Railway. This road leads directly to the entrance of the tunnel.  There are barriers up to encourage cyclists to slow down and a historic cast iron bridge (pictured below) which does make sections of the path narrower than it needs to be. The tunnel has a slight incline all the way along (rising toward the Holyrood Park end), but it is a good smooth surface. It is very dark inside. Sound is amplified and their is a noticeable temperature drop in the tunnel."
5454,Lovely staff! 
5455,Restaurant - Function Hall - Main Bar all have individual accessible entrances.  Main Bar doors are big and heavy if not open require a bit of negotiation. tables were a good height for  wheel chair use.
5456,"Conishead Priory is a lovely old building. The cafe is open from 11am to 5 .there are tables with sunshades on the lawn. Paths lead straight from the gardens to the shore of Morecambe Bay, but it is advisable to use the lane by the entrance, the gradient is gentle on this route. This leads to a broad path through lovely mature woodland. After about quarter of a mile the Bay is reached. Is is a good spot for bird watching on the incoming tide . "
5457,Beautiful grounds leading to a large accessible House and Gallery full of history with amazing contents. 
5458,Level access everywhere just some low door thresholds. Don’t think there was any hearing or Braille signage.
5459,I can't comment on the toilet because I haven't used it. I know there is one on the same level but it isn't accessible in a wheelchair or scooter.
5460,Easily accessible. No problems getting in and out.
5461,We had no trouble getting a place in the on-site parking.
5462,Here's a bar with a difference as it has an Australian theme. You can get in the door and there's space to move around and pick your spot.
5463,Ours was okay but the other one was taken away mis concert and that side was mostly wheelchair users so not sure what they done.
5464,"Accessible toilet in reception area, not visited  Bathroom in accessible bedroom roomy and plenty of grab rails"
5465,"The entrance is step-free, there is room to manoeuvre around the restaurant in a wheelchair, and the staff are very attentive, and keen to help you select the best possible table for comfort and spaciousness."
5466,There is 1 bay for blue badge parking outside the venue and 2 small car parks near by. There are good public transport links though.
5467,Generally helpful and cheerful.
5468,All on a level other than one smaller area of the cafe
5469,"The door way has automatic doors, when in there are now screens to buy tickets, but I opted to get mine from the til which are now upstairs. It seems you can't use a CEA card at the machines. The lift hasn't had an upgrade sadly and is still very small and difficult to turn in, but it does the job!   There was a lower til but no one came to serve us there so I went to a normal til which was too high so my friend had to do everything for me, it's actually taller than the old tills. This would be fine if staff asked wheelchair users if they would like to be served at the lower till, as I'm guessing that's what its for.  EDIT: I went to see another film already and was served again at a high til. I asked about the lower area and asked if this was for wheelchair users, the staff member was very nice and said she guesses so, so I asked if wheelchair users can be seen there instead then as the desk is too tall and she just agreed that the other tills were too high. So it seems they are reluctant or unable to easily move tils and the lower bit is not manned.   Now for the actual cinema... SO much better! The first thing I noticed when we reached out screen room was the sets of doors were further apart which was a great improvement for getting through in my wheelchair. When you get through the doors the isle up to the seats is on a slope and there are handrails at each side. The isles are well lit and in screen 1, the wheelchair spaces are a few rows back from the screen- I prefer to be a little further back and not so close to the screen. There are little lights on the floor with the wheelchair symbol and seat number. I decided to get out my wheelchair and try out the new luxe seats and couldn't believe how comfy they were, like sitting on a cloud! There is a tray table that moves and has a cup holder, and arm rests that lift up. On the inside of the left arm there are flat black buttons, on pressing these the leg rests slowly rises and lifts your legs up effortlessly, then the back rest starts to recline. It was so comfy I could have slept there! There are less seats in the cinema and more space, it is well lit and easy to move about in.   The cinema have showings with audio descriptions. There are also showings with captions which are listed separately online. There are Autism Friendly showings on Sunday mornings specifically designed for those with sensory processing issues; the lights and sounds are lower, there are no trailers or adverts, and more allowance for increased levels of movement and noise  All screens have step free access.  The isense screens are much louder"
5470,"There are three entrance to the garden, two with gravel underfoot and one with paving slabs (the entrance from Watergate). The garden itself is a mixture of paving slabs, gravel and grass. There are raised plant beds which is good for seeing the different plants in the garden. I also appreciate the fact that there were quite a few benches around the garden. I've not given it 5 stars as I know gravel is not the easiest for everyone to navigate."
5471,The Toning Tables and chairs are a very useful exercise opportunity for the disabled.
5472,"The south lake safari zoo is personally the best zoo that i have visited. It was an amazing experience to be able to have hands on experience with animals such as lemurs and giraffes, being able to get close with these animals and feed them was an fantastic and i would love to do it again. The safari zoo is accessible for wheelchair users allowing interaction with the animals as the walkways had been designed to make everything accessible for everyone. Accessible  toilet facilities were situated at the main entrance and clearly sign posted. The zoo does have natural inclines therefore a wheelchair user may need additional support in these areas, especially near the snow leopards area and when leaving the zoo to head towards the car park, the staff of the zoo were very helpful therefore the staff would be more then happy to provide assistance. Disabled parking bays are available near the entrance of the zoo."
5473,"As I said above, they were brilliant, welcoming, knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful and helped to make my visit special."
5474,"The hotel loo was very good but access to city loos are very disappointing. Space was very restricted and most toilets were too low for my height which is 6' 2"" / 1.87m"
5475,We arrived by bus to the East Park Drive side of the park. The bus was wheelchair accessible. There were plenty of entrances dotted around the park and several of these had parking nearby.
5476,"We went on the third day of the festival so there was already soft ground and mud. However what wasn't there tracking down?? When we first turned into the car park we got stuck. Luckily there were some staff there to push us out (I think they had been doing that a lot by the look of them!). Then when we got to the dedicated Disabled Parking that was all boggy and muddy too. We managed to unload and get to the disabled camping area where the ""Disabled Check In"" tent was."
5477,"As mentioned previously, good level access entrance but doors a bit on the heavy side. Once inside you go through double doors to the bar which can be a little awkward. Decent space inside the bar."
5478,"Good size, meets min access requirements."
5479,"All of the public transport is very cheap and accessible for wheelchair users which makes it the most ideal way of traveling around the Costa del Sol area. The public bus takes you right into the centre of the town and it is only a couple of minutes  walk away from the beach which is also accessible by wheel chair. However, if you were to drive then there are plenty of disabled parking bays which are local to the beach and the shops, and all of the disabled parking bays have level access ground, making it easy to get around the town and to the beach."
5480,"The access for me was fantastic. The inside of the restaurant is very spacious, with a range of different seating options, so I managed to find a seat that I could transfer in to quite easily. The only downside for access is that the entry door is quite heavy so I needed assistance from my daughter when opening the door. "
5481,I was meeting a friend at the Scottish Parliament for a coffee in their cafe. I arrived at the Parliament building and was fast tracked through security so that I did not have to queue with my guide dog. The Parliament knew I was coming as I had alerted them to my assistance requirements using Welcome app by Neatebox and I was met by a member of the Parliament staff as soon as I had been through security. I was told that my friend had already arrived and was assisted through to the cafe. 
5482,All good
5483,"Those we met served us well and attentively, and were considerate of our needs, showing helping hands when needed."
5484,Located beside the café and picnic area but there are also loos in a block in the middle of the park.
5485,"The Stadium has great access and the wheelchair seats have a superb view of the field and track.   Loos are clearly marked and well equipped.  The Park is beautiful and has lovely smooth paths, with lots of seating at regular intervals."
5486,"This Place has level access up to the bar and has a disabled toilet.  There are numerous tables,  some high and some normal height. Staff are friendly and helpful.. They serve nice hot and cold food. Mostly stuff like burgers, hotdogs or chips. This places popular with younger people  and they have games consoles which  people can play on."
5487,"Broughty Ferry Harbour was a discovery that took the imagination back in time. With a castle on one side, the tidal harbour in the centre and the two pier like breakwaters there was a lot to see and do."
5488,"The Langham Hotel is about a mile from Eastbourne train station and the town centre's shopping area. From outside the train station I took a taxi, about £5 (May 2019). The hotel is on the sea front between the Pier and the Redoubt Fortress, which appears to be the quieter end of he sea front. Throughout my stay I found the taxi drivers all very helpful, immediately taking my suitcase and checking that I was comfortable before we drove off."
5489,This wheelchair accessible 1950s yacht served the Royal Family for over 44 years and is now docked in Edinburgh at Ocean Terminal a great 5-star visitor attraction whilst being available for special events.
5490,Accessible toilet to Approved Document M standard with baby change included not separate.
5491,The staff were lovely. Happy to explain the menu and they had a sign stating they had gluten free and vegan options. 
5492,"Easy to find, automated front door, dropped reception counter."
5493,"Heavy doors but once in, very spacious and accessible. Restrooms were spread out across the park. "
5494,"Normal disabled loo, clean and with grab rails. Would take a wheelchair ok."
5495,"Orchards is all on one level and has a level entrance, but has narrow corridors between furniture. The staff are very friendly and will move things out of the way. There is no bell or knocker on the door at the front but it is usually open except in winter, door width 830mm. There is also a door at the back to pick up heavy items, and Orchards will deliver. Till height 880mm. No hearing induction loop and no braille support. There is lots of seating available! "
5496,There was a wide entrance with automatic doors. The entrance was spacious and there was a corridor to reach the room. There were also two doors for the emergency exit and the room was brightly lit.
5497,"The RADAR toilet is always very clean, there is a pull alarm and bars around the toilet that can be moved up. This toilet is also used as a changing area and staff toilet however."
5498,There is not a lot of space for a transfer from wheelchair onto the toilet. The general space to have your career in was not good. It was clean and smelt ok.
5499,"Large car park near the door, my small scooter got over the slight roughness easily."
5500,"Parking spaces right at the door, plus the hotel staff recognise that not everybody disabled has a blue badge and still try ensure easy access, would phone in advance during holidays or weekends to let them know you have requirements as they are very busy."
5501,Enough room to move around but the cafe is quite long and narrow in shape. Nice wide doors to enter and exit.
5502,There was ample disabled and a led parking and a shuttle bus to take diabled people to the main show ground. I am sure there are local buses that would take you to the museum too. We had fast track access thanks to a red badge that took us out the main line of traffic straight to the car park. 
5503,"For the first time EVER I experienced LUXURY and total ACCESSIBILITY. Gorgeous cottage with every comfort and disability aid you could want, either as standard or to request. All this without the faintest hint of clinical ! You have to visit, if you can ! Very popular so few slots free but can’t praise this cottages and it’s owners enough."
5504,"We have already reviewed four hotels for you that belong to the Handpicked group of hotels, and they really are delightful hotels, 5 stars the norm, so we were really looking forward to our overnight stay at Nutfield Priory. What a disappointment ! It started off well, the driveway towards the hotel looked great, (photo 1) spring flowers opening up, well cut and maintained grounds, and the old building looked  historical and grand (photo 2) the tower of the entrance guarding the hall, old chimney pots looked magnificent, we were ready (3). We parked opposite the entrance in one of the two disabled bays (4) and headed for the hotels entrance, and found a step waiting for us. (5) No ramp in sight, so my husband had to get up out of his wheelchair, and stagger up the step.  Inside we were greeted by two very friendly receptionist ,and who turned out during our stay to be very kind and helpful, and the reception area looked old but pleasing enough (photo 6) Booking in was soon done and we would be escorted up to ,our room on the second floor, and we were pleased to be told that a lift was available, which was situated behind the reception desk, through a very narrow doorway and small tight square passage (photo 7 shows the entrance behind the lamp) with a turn to get wheelchair into the small lift, where my husband continually seemed to catch his hands against the lifts edges, causing him to scrape his hands, and wipe the blood off his knuckles. A corridor led to our bedroom (8) number 25, and pleased to see we could leave wheelchair by front door (9) and the room looked very nice (10) with nice big bed for us, ( BUT THE ROOM WAS FREEZING) the cast iron radiator was not working, so we tried to sort the heating out by putting setting to high on wall panel and hoped this would warm the room up. There was plenty of room to move around (11) and in  walk-in bathroom we had soft white towels and pleased to see pull cord connected to call button (12) while the walk in shower was plenty big enough for us (13) Right, time to investigate Nutfield Priory. We took chair into the large delightful drawing room (photo 14) with lovely glass framed windows offering plenty of light, and saw the 1874 restored organ which suited its place in the historical hotel (15), (BUT AGAIN IT WAS FREEZING IN THERE) the fire, set in the original fireplace was ( not lit until the next day ) (photo 16). The side doorway would lead into the bar lounge with its small but nicely wooden bar (17) which took us to see the delightful restaurant (18) which was nicely laid ready for dining tonight. The old wooden panelled library was interesting and looked authentic (20)  and would be a pleasant quiet place to enjoy reading one of the many books and catch up with the history of Nutfield Priory.  HISTORY It was difficult to find the early history of the Priory, but we believe it was once a home built for Monks, so our history continues from records of 1849, when this original mansion was rebuilt by Thomas Fowlerwood. From 1855 a banker, Henry Edward Gurney added much improvements to enhance this mansion, until he was declared bankrupt, so the property was sold to Joshua Fielden who was once an MP in Lancashire, and he basically rebuilt the property, to include the Tower. He had 11 children with his wife Ellen, and he was known as a caring man who sought the interest and welfare of others. When Joshua died in 1887 Nutfield was held in trust for his wife Ellen, until 1920 when she sold the property.  It was then sold to a Mr Ferris, who lived here until 1930, then under the care of  Mr O Picton Davies he turned the property into what we start to see today, a very expensive hotel, and he included  nine hole golf course by the lake. Over the next few years a number of changes were made in how the mansion was being used, until its opening as a boarding school for deaf children, but this closed in 1987, and a year later it opened up as a hotel again. It is now under the care of Handpicked hotels.  To continue with our details of hotel for you, and why we were so disappointed with our visit.  It seemed to us that Handpicked Hotels have allowed Nutfield Priory to have that look of neglect, and has been allowed to go downhill for some years now. Paint has stripped off woodwork, the stained panels and doors need work to be done on them, carpets have threadbare areas and joints are separating and look tired. The general appearance is not up to the standard of other Handpicked Hotels we have visited and reviewed for Euans guide in which we gave top marks for, so having paid so much money and so looking forward to staying here, it was quite a shock to see the place so neglected. And worse of all, the whole building was SO COLD, there was no heat on anywhere, and we froze in our room. We were of course given the usual rubbish, our maintenance manager checked the heat this morning and it was working,) just how  many times have we heard that, and other guest were also deeply concerned that we all had to feel so cold. It’s not cheap to stay at Handpicked Hotels, so all in all, a big disappointment for us personally.  Out next visit for the groups hotels will be to Rookery Hall, and we do so hope that will bring back our confidence in handpicked Hotels. Mind you, may we say thank you to the young receptionist on duty that evening, she tried so hard for us to get warmth, she took the time and trouble to spend an hour hunting around the hotel to find heaters for us, and kindly brought up two heaters to our room, so that on waking the next morning we had a warm room, so thanks goes to her for her effort on our behalf.   OUR FINAL THOUGHTS About our part one review of Nutfield Priory hotel.  Leaving our disappointment behind, this could again become an interesting and historical hotel, it’s got a lot going for it, and if you read part two and our part three, you will see that we have offered far more favourable remarks on our visit here, but it’s just at the moment, until management get the hotel back up To a standard we expect from Handpicked hotels, then we shall not be recommending you visiting or staying here."
5505,"There are plenty of blue badge parking spaces in the car park, and they are a stones throw away from the visitors centre and the park itself. The parking area is gravel, making it slightly challenging for wheelchair users, but the parking spaces are so close to the visitors centre that you're not on the gravel for long."
5506,"Separate disabled toilet with usual grabrails and folding lever, thankfully reasonably clutter free. Space to turn and room for carer."
5507,There is a big step at the entrance. The shop has no wheelchair ramp. I was unable to get inside. Zero stars.
5508,"For an old building the Filmhouse did a great job of making this venue wheelchair friendly. Access to the venue was adequate and the toilet facilities were spacious and clean, although I found the seat a little high, otherwise it was fine. Prices of food can be a little high but their drinks were very good and the staff very friendly. I would visit this venue again."
5509,From the train to the station concourse is fairly straigforward once you locate the lift. It's tucked away at the end of the platform along its own corridor. The lift itself is large and has plenty of turning space. Once on ground level there's a clearly marked route to the barriers where one is wide enough for wheelchair access. One route out of the station from the Jubilee Line is level.
5510,"The palace is in the city centre. There are a number of buses that stop nearby. The metro and buses in Copenhagen have designated spaces for wheelchair users. Their website says that ""Disabled parking space is available at the Bertel Thorvaldsen Plads (by the entrance to the Thorvaldsen Museum)."""
5511,Staff were all very friendly and happily positioned the table so I was able to sit comfortably. Nothing was ever too much just a shame it didn't have an accessible loo.
5512,There is a car park at the rear and a shopping centre as close to both the train station and the bus station.
5513,I visit Horsforth Library at least once a week. I sometimes take my two year old grandson who loves it. Plenty of children's books with a dedicated seating area. The staff are so polite and helpful I never hesitate to ask for help.
5514,The 2 members of staff at the entrance were very helpful. They explained the museum layout when I asked them and they also directed me to the tram stop for my return journey. I didn't see any room stewards in the ground floor gallery and there was one sitting at the top of the stairs on the upper floor.
5515,"TOILETS and REFRESHMENTS Poor access, approached round the end of the Main Stand"
5516,There's a bell on the door which you can ring to ask for assistance. There is step free access and a decent width of door. It's a lot bigger than it looks from the outside - it was spacious and the furniture layout is flexible so you can arrange as you wish.
5517,"Yes. large, clean and beautifully decorated like the rest of the place."
5518,"Many stops around the city, operating both a upper and lower tour."
5519,"Easy to find disabled toilets as close to reception desk, but mens or ladies do have push doors to worry about, I personally had to get off my wheelchair to get inside and to then get into disabled toilet, so disappointing there. The toilet was clean and tidy, with grab rails and pull cord, and you can spin your chairs inside, if you managed to have a Carer with you to help get into the toilet."
5520,"Would of been a 10 had the lifts been slightly larger, although managed fine in the lift with a larger than average  wheelchair. Excellent access and excellent, helpful staff."
5521,There was a lot of seats going through the shopping centre and lots of seats in most of the shops and they can see everything they wanted to. They also had a lift and a ramp and escalators for easier access.
5522,The Premier Inn in Lauriston Place is a well placed for getting to most parts of the city. It offers a bright light and welcoming environment.
5523,Arriving at the station it was a bit daunting by its size and loads of platforms. Soon got the hang of it  as the signage was good.
5524,Wheelchair accessible restaurant with incredible Indian food
5525,"Accessible toilet on bar level, door opens inwards, red cord tied up, not very spacious for powerchair user and carer to fit. "
5526,Ample parking in the area immediately along the beachfront and beside the office.
5527,"Tourist mini train which travels along La Croisette, Cannes' sea front, and through Le Suquet, Cannes' hilly old town area. The train makes a 10 minute stop in the square outside Notre Dame to visit the church and see the views from the top of the hill."
5528,The hotel is located in Lauriston Place which is well served by local bus services. It’s a short walk to both Lothian Road and the Grassmarket.
5529,Parking next door at big car park. Only a very short distance to centre.
5530,"There were accessible toilets off the dining area and off the reception. These were bright, light and spacious."
5531,"A good venue to visit to see bands or for a club night, set across one level with no steep areas, tabled seating available, along with a cheap bar, and moderately sized dance floor area, however the venue is compact and can very busy at times, namely the weekend."
5532,"For parking, check the Council website at https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20043/disability_and_accessibility. There's not much at some University buildings but blue badge holders can park in residents only bays as well as disabled bays on the roads."
5533,Parking and transport to the museum is the hardest part of accessing this fab place! There is on street parking nearby (there is handy information on their website about this) but I couldn't see any disabled parking bays. There is a bus that you can get but you have to navigate down a fairly steep hill which might be difficult for wheelchair users.
5534,"Easy to find,  but seems to be used as a parent and child loo as well so don't be surprised if you have to queue!"
5535,"There is a ground floor accessible toilet. It's spacious, clean with grab rails but no emergency cord. The first time I went I was standing for a while to get into the accessible toilet and when I went to ask staff to check if someone was in it, they came with me and opened it, telling me it sometimes locks itself."
5536,There was parking close at hand but we walked through the park to get there. 
5537,Parking in The Kingsgate multi story. Prices have been slashed so don't be afraid to use it. Shopmobility on lower ground. Phone ahead and they will meet you with a scooter 01383 661455
5538,"There are two disabled toilets in situ outside the main toilets; plus disabled toilets inside the main toilets.  All with good lighting, good space for manoeuvring, and equipment in place that's appropriate, i.e.. wash basin is lower."
5539,"I drove into the first large car park on the left hand side, with disabled access close to the entrance of the gardens. There was a short walk from the car park down a gentle slop, there are are 3 steps if you prefer to walk down steps.  There is a drop off/collection point available at Crag Lane adjacent to the shop building."
5540,All areas are ramped with wide door ways. Wheelchair access is provided for the rides and take you directly to the platform. Clear information about the nature of the ride and staff on hand to provide reassurance and help in decisions. Saw several young people in wheelchairs BUT all require you to be able to transfer.
5541,"Reasonably roomy disabled toilet, at the back and with space to manoeuvre, but with some form of obstruction in the transfer space. Clean and tidy and space for a carer. "
5542,"The nearest step-free station is Green Park which is more than half a mile away. A few bus routes will drop you off in Shaftesbury Avenue, which is a short distance away. There is a multi-storey car park in nearby Brewer St."
5543,Lift down to all facilities including the castle.  Mobility scooters available free of charge down at lift door. Short film was subtitled and easy access room. Ramped area down to castle and into castle ruins.  Accessible shop and cafe.  Disabled toilet has private key held in shop beside it.
5544,Access from the street requires going through a main door quickly followed by a 2nd door that opens into the bar and dining area.
5545,"The doors are wide enough to easily get in when both open. They were automatic but were not working at the time of the visit. Once inside it's very welcoming with plenty of space, moveable furniture, and helpful staff."
5546,Lots of transport links/options for people to get into the city centre the nearest tram stop to the arena is Victoria. 
5547,The staff were great despite there not being too many of them. It was a fairly busy time of day so I really appreciate the time that they took to help me and ensure that I felt welcome.
5548,"Level access. Restaurant was rather small and narrow inside, upstairs would not be accessible. Which is a pity as we enjoyed our dinner up on the balcony.  The seating outside would be accessible though and perhaps with more room.   "
5549,Getting in from street level means going up a sloped entrance. It seemed a bit slippy and could be tricky when it's wet if you're unsteady on your feet. Getting around was OK as a powerchair user although a couple of points were a little narrow but people were great at shifting things and making space.
5550,We drove from London to Leeds in my car & then into the village set. Most people arrive by coach but the coach is not wheelchair accessible. We joined the tour group on site & went around together. The only negative thing was that there were a steps (eg. into the church) which would make this inaccessible to most powerchair users. I still had a great day. 
5551,The staff were wonderful
5552,The disabled parking was right outside the  cabin and there was plenty of room for two cars.
5553,parking bays within 50m of entrance. Bus stops 100m away from major routes.
5554,"The museum has installed 2 toilets, I did not use them but I don’t think they were accessible."
5555,"Clean and gender neutral, if I remember correctly."
5556,"I visited Southampton Pride during a visit 'down South'. It was my first Pride, so I wasn't too sure what to expect. What I found was brilliant: it was a fully accessible venue, laid out over an open street plan with grassy areas to sit and accessible toilets. All grassy areas had edgings around them, but they also had ramps situated at strategic points to ensure wheelchair users could access the grassy areas for some sun worshiping (it was a cracking day!). The main stage (the only stage I visited, so I can't comment for others) had a BSL interpreter for all acts and interim crowd entertainers, it seemed to be the same BSL interpreter all day though so I'm sure she must've been exhausted by the end of it! The ramps, coupled with the provision of accessible toilets and Mobiloo being on-site made for an extremely enjoyable experience. The only reason I've not given it 5-stars is because some of the steps didn't have highlights on them so, as a visually impaired person, I sometimes found it a bit challenging navigating those.   Overall it was a fantastically enjoyable experience where everyone, no matter who you were or what your story was, was made to feel welcome. "
5557,"There is one disabled parking space and one other at the door but lots of local roadside parking available. Public transport available close-by, bus stop at end of street and railway station (Paisley Gilmour Street) within half a mile."
5558,Polite and efficient.
5559,The disabled parking is underground on level 0. There is a row of parking spaces for the disabled which are located right next to the front entrance to the shopping centre. There is a local mini bus or a regular bus which departs from the roundabout opposite the forum Algarve. 
5560,"THIS IS PART TWO OF OUR MOATHOUSE REVIEWS, and A very pleasant garden awaits your visit, choose a sunny warm day to visit, and relax in the grounds, it’s delightful.   This old 14th century Manor surrounded by water, has remains of an old moat, a pleasant walk around two small ornamental duck ponds,  bordered by a lovely stretch of canal, often full of moored boats, ducks galore who wander around without a care in the world, a truly wonderful sunny warm summers day visit.  Coming out of reception, make use of the ramp by the entrance, (photo 1) and go  down and around towards the pool (photo 2) then face an uphill push for your carer, easy enough if they are fit, (3) and find an empty bench to look over the pool (4). It’s a lovely small pool, usually full of a variety of water birds (5) before heading back towards the hotel (6).  Over to the left is the second of the pools, where you will see many wedding photos being taken (7) as it’s so scenic a spot (8) Now go up towards the old pub itself (photo 9) and pass its entrance (10)  and walk past the side entrance (11) towards the greenhouse looking conservatory of its restaurant (12) which is really a nice place to enjoy an evening meal. (13 and 14) which overlooks a canalside view (15) with a small terrace is available (16)."
5561,"Staff at this branch are unusually unhelpful, slow-witted and incompetent - it took three attempts for us to get the drinks we had asked for, because staff were not paying attention, or did not understand perfectly clear instructions. The staff I spoke to concerning the toilet were rude, intransigent and unhelpful - especially the team leader, who was standing in for the manager, who had abandoned the shop at 4pm. After a long and fruitless discussion with the team leader about the toilet, he offered to get me a feedback card so that I could put my complaint in writing. He then went downstairs and didn't return. Is this customer service??"
5562,The Motel One is a modern hotel build within an old building. It’s very well located for the railway station.
5563,The staff are always really helpful at Rocksalt and will do anything they possibly can to make sure that you have a nice time there.
5564,"On arrival there is a bumpy path towards the ticket office .  The ticket office has cobble flooring as does the courtyard which offers access to the tea rooms and toilets .   The path to the house was mainly paved and flat and wasn’t too rough for my wheelchair .  The house itself is currently only open downstairs all of which was wheelchair accessible. Floors are generally smooth with a few carpets which may be a little difficult for manual wheelchairs . Larger wheelchairs may also need to take care as one or two doorways where a little tight .  The cafe was good with lots of choice including vegan options however you have to access the cafe through the courtyard which can be a bit of a rough ride . Please note if you are on your own and wish to use the outdoor seating transporting your food will be difficult as this seating is located back across through the courtyard and over the cobbles.  To the right of the cafe there is the kitchen garden. For me this was very accessible with paved flat paths with gentle slopes throughout .There was lots to see and was very interesting definitely the highlight of my trip !  The main gardens are accessed via a path by the house . Upon arrival we were given a map and told to follow the red route as we were told this has step free access throughout and is suitable for wheelchairs . However the paths in the gardens at the back of the house were mainly small stones which was bumpy and not a smooth ride .The pathways are not marked clearly and better signage is really needed here. We tried to follow the map provided but we did end up on a path that was steep , extremely rocky and not suitable for wheelchairs !  The terrain and hill made my wheelchair skid and I needed a lot of help to navigate these paths. Whether this path was part of the red route or not was unclear but I wouldn’t recommend the main gardens due to the paths in general not being very smooth and at times narrow to. The price of a ticket was £11 which included the house and gardens . I did not see any discount for disabled however I think you can get a free carer/ companion in with you if you have the appropriate proof .  I visited here as I recently joined the national trust but I was a bit disappointed with this visit due to the lack of signage , the uneven bumpy paths and the facilities being somewhat difficult to visit . "
5565,Fabulous welcoming 
5566,Six disabled spaces directly outside restaurant. Completely level access from car parking space to restaurant.
5567,The staff are great I have autism
5568,Once on the beach I was fine (I have a power trike).  Slightly tricky over dunes. Help was needed on path through dunes in places and for a few metres at top of the beach.
5569,Service was wonderful. When you arrive you wait to be served and it is table service. Staff were welcoming and friendly. 
5570,"Wide level access. Staff saw me at the door and came over to offer help. Cleared the way to a suitable table. Order point easy to access, staff brought my purchases to the table. "
5571,"Easy to use, clean and a good size."
5572,Toilets fab they have a changing place For 2 adults
5573,"Kept locked - the key is available on the counter, attached to a purple whisk, so you can't miss it. There's an alarm cord and a grab rail beside the lavatory. Misses out on five stars only because there is no grab rail by the wash hand basin and the room is quite small so manoeuvering might present problems."
5574,Accessible emergency red cord. Plenty of room to manoeuvre around and room to fit my carer in. Plenty of grab rails Clean and tidy. Keypad to get into the toilet which I couldn't use due to difficulty with my hands - it would be better for there to be a radar key on the accessible loo.
5575, We drove to the restaurant and parked in the carpark (see photo).
5576,"Very poor, left after three separate lots of staff made my life more difficult.  First group standing in the way with no awareness of me needing to get passed, blocking my way. Second person, management, turned right into my path without looking, and excused this unsafe practise, by saying she was busy looking after a customer, inexcusable for not paying attention. Third group were intent on sorting a display, darting across my path even although I had a very visible walking frame, so absolutely no awareness of mobility, balance or safety.  Left distressed. Previously had a member of management, telling me that the momentum of the stocking cage meant she didn't have control of the cage.  I lucky managed to stop, not fall over or get knocked over by the cage, she wasn't controlling.  Down right dangerous. Left upset"
5577,Friendly enough but unable to solve my problem 
5578,"Rose Street is in the Center of the Newtown, buses, trams are 100m and there are ample parking bays with usual blue badge consideration. Rose Street is however pedestrianised, it’s cobbled and one has to take care in walking."
5579,"Seems to have good access, but as I don't drive I can't comment on the parking, there do seem to be multi storey carparks very close to this station."
5580,Provision of accessible loo's and their have been extra ones added since previous years down at stage level.
5581,"Only had a little interaction with staff (at disabled entrance) but they were very warm and welcoming, despite the fact they were there to bag-check. "
5582,Plenty of space both in the villa and in the accessible flat. The pathway down to the flat is smooth and well lit after dark.
5583,"I wish I could give this restaurant a better rating, as the food is fantastic, but to get inside you have to mount three tall steps, and they have no ramp or other means of surmounting these steps. If you can get past these steps, then things are fine once you're inside, with a step-free ground floor dining area, though the 'accessible' toilet is only half-decent - see below."
5584,"The main access into the building is up 4 steps, more stairs inside to get up to the upper levels. Lift for disabled access and prams. Floors were level, however some of it is narrow. There was a poorly located sign with a phone number, on the outside of the building, to call for disabled access. It was on a door up 4 stairs, the disabled access is through the door marked Anthony's (the old restaurant) not marked disabled. It was locked but could be opened by phoning the number. The electronic ramp didn't work so wooden ramps had been put there, and it's also where the bins are stored!"
5585,You can either access the pier via the 'top' part or via a lift from the seafront (this'll make sense when you're there!). The pier has level access right along it - but there was a sign up to make wheelchair users aware that because of the 'planked' surface there are sometimes gaps and if you have narrow wheels then you have to pay a bit more attention! There are quaint 'shelters' at points along the pier as well if you want to take a seat. 
5586,"Outstandingly helpful. The lady who sold us our tickets asked whether the wheelchair was powered and when we said ""no"" gave the accompanist free entry. She also gave us clear directions about where the lifts are. Every time we approached a door, a member of staff rushed to open it."
5587,Very cheerful and helpful. Communicated well and took our order so we didn't have to carry our drinks outside. 
5588,The car park has many disabled parking spaces close to the entrance which is ideal for individuals who have trouble getting around. There are also bus stops.  
5589,"We could park right outside the cottage. Not sure how close the bus comes to this site, but there's a long drive from the road to the cottage in any case. The parking area is level and smooth."
5590,Parking is on a compacted field/soil surface. 6 spaces for blue badge holders on the left of the entrance on the same ground. Drop off recommended. Smooth path to the new ticket centre entrance.
5591,If you can drive there the Parking is ok some on the level of the cottages some though up a hill.  There is level access into the cottages ( three are across cobbles three are paved).  I did not measure the width of the doors.  Should have .  Sorry but they seemed far narrower then the modern building reg width.
5592,"We have visited many times as the access is good for us, the food is good and they have a good selection of garden plants, furniture and interior homewards and gifts. "
5593,Easy to find but I didn't use them so not sure how to rate.
5594,"Our 2nd visit and still amazing. A home from home where all disability Aids required were ready for use on our arrival. Lodges are fantastic with everything you need, staff friendly, views beautiful and lodge and gardens well kept. A great base for a family holiday that includes all. Thank you"
5595,Too small lack of room for wheelchair transfer or carer Lock on door was small and fiddly
5596,"For access to the away stand there is a disabled entrance from the George Hill Stand, which requires the attention of the stewards and there is a bit of a steep ramp, but the alternate entrance from the Zen Office Stand means a long walk from both the official car park and B&Q. The seating bays are very large and right at the front so your view of the game is not obstructed."
5597,"Signage was good, but occasionally we had to ask where the appropriate lift was - staff always very happy to help."
5598,Really pleasant-and apologetic for the inconvenient refurbishment underway.  
5599,Well located and labeled on maps and signs and spotlessly clean
5600,"The Starbucks coffee shop on Canongate is a sweet spot for people watching. Situated along the busy street you can watch the world go by and be comfortable knowing there are accessible toilet facilities, space to relax, move around, and the staff are lovely!"
5601,Very easy.  Liked the priority seating area.
5602,Knowledgeable staff clearly visible and they were expecting us
5603,"I use this station fortnightly or more often. It can be accessed by your own vehicle, taxis, tram, local free bus or on foot but are some big caveats which need to be added. There are considerable differences between access to platforms 1 and 10 inside the main concourse but also between those and platforms 13/14. There are only 2 accessible toilets and only 1 on the main concourse itself. Neither are well signed; maintained and in 1 case not especially accessible. They are abused by staff working at the station because they are near. Staff on the station are okay with obvious physical disability but nothing better than okay.  The attitude of senior station staff is generally very poor.   Signage in the station is hugely variable. Different ownership does not help. So, for example the tram signage is far superior to the train signage and so on. The main concourse is cluttered and there is considerable glare from reflective flooring and poor use of glass."
5604,"I find staff helpful and empathic.   They encourage taking time to obtain correct tickets, at best price and will give information on any possible drawbacks eg  the station for disembarking is unmanned, so the ticket collector on train would provide assistance, and will check re accessible exit.   They are very informative of future restrictions eg prior booking was required to allow train journeys to Glasgow during Commonwealth Games where otherwise I can go to statiion without prior booking for assistance."
5605,Mostly on one level - a couple of different step free entrances - the altar area is raised but didn't hinder our visit too much as you can see around the rest of it. Fascinating plaques on the wall commemorating some of Kuala Lumpur's interesting historical residents - many of them with very British sounding names who were involved in skirmishes of some sort! Lovely and cool for a 10 reflection before heading back out into the Malaysian heat!
5606,"Step-free access into the shop. So far so good. The ground floor display stands at the front of the shop leave enough room to get around them with a wheelchair. The display stands at the back are too tightly crammed together, with no room for wheelchair access between them. Half of the shop is in the basement. There is a staircase but no lift."
5607,I went by car to get to Heathrow it is a 45 to 50 minutes journey to the airport. There is disabled parking at Heathrow airport in the car park with quite a few spaces and you're able to get space very often.
5608,The trail was wide enough for most wheelchair users to access the routes however the path may be less accessible if the weather is wet and windy. The bark and mud path it could be hard for wheelchair users to use. Using a cane would be difficult due to the terrain and the unpredictable objects in the way. e.g. fallen branches.
5609,Genial! Didn't need any particular help!
5610,"The loo was clean and tidy, but a little small and the lock was broken.  They did have a sign to say they were aware of the lock being broken.  I was fine as I had my dad with me to stand guard but not sure what you were meant to do it you were alone - sing?"
5611,Access into the museum is on the level and lift access to the other floors.
5612,"On matchday (particularly for internationals), the main obstacle is the sheer volume of people (who can be very rude!) There are three lifts but quite inexplicably only one (very small) gets used to the disabled terrace.  It is all level access in the stadium."
5613,"The bungalows are wheelchair accessible with wide corridors, a great kitchen and bedrooms.  It sleeps 6 very comfortably.  I am a wheelchair user and its the best accommodation I have ever stayed in.  The grounds are great for my assistance dog who loves playing with Rod and Peggy's dogs.  Peggy and Rod are great and will go out of their way to provide equipment and offer any other signposting to services if they can not directly provide.  One of the bungalows has a ceiling tract hoist and they all have rise and recline chairs (I think).  As a family we have stayed in lots of accommodation and this in my opinion is the best.  Its a great base for loads of places.  "
5614,We did see a couple of wheelchair user parking spaces - the vehicle entrance is in St Machar Drive. Bus no. 20 from the city centre  gets you quite close - see review of St Machar's Cathedral for detail.
5615,Disabled toilets on all three floors.
5616,The toilets are on the lower ground floor accessible by lift. There were 2 accessible toilets. One was a changing room with changing mat and shower. The other was a regular sized accessible toilet. Both had grab rails and red cords. However the red cord in the changing room toilet was short.
5617,I find it really easy to get the bus here - the stop is right outside the main entrance to the zoo. There is also a large car park on a steep hill. 
5618,Loads of level disabled parking right outside of the main entrance.
5619,"The market was easy to access and had multiple entry ways. All areas of the market were accessible to our wheelchair users, however some of the routes between stalls were narrow. Overall there were very wide spaces in between the stalls. "
5620,"I came by public transport. Lothian buses 11,15,16,23,36,45 pass at Holy Corner"
5621,Flat entrance to hotel and to the new wing.
5622,"Every Friday my best mate and I would go here after he finished work just for 'one.' We both knew we were kidding ourselves and generally nursed a sore head the day after.   This is a beautiful tiled proper old mans pub, which i have been going to since moving here in 2002. Back then I hated it because it was really smokey and smelly (like many pubs back then) but the live acts on a Sunday evening pulled a great crowd.  Today it has excellent selection of Ales, Lager and IPA'S - a member of CAMRA and it has a great friendly atmosphere of all ages and personalities!    Great new menu!"
5623,"The staff are helpful and accommodating, when you walk into the store you are approached by a member of staff can help you towards what you are looking for and lead you to someone who can give you the support you need. "
5624,The staff member who served me at the counter was extremely welcoming and helpful. He asked me to take a seat and offered to bring my drink to me. Great service!
5625,"One of very few level access tattoo studios in Edinburgh. The shop is spacious and comfortable, staff are wonderful and talented!"
5626,"We just stayed one night here, which is probably just as well for our waistlines because the food is fabulous! The rooms and the restaurant are in the stable blocks of a château, and while some of the rooms are upstairs, some, including ours (room two) are on the ground floor as is the restaurant and reception. I don't know how many adapted rooms they have, (just the one, I think) but ours was very spacious and had some adaptations, detailed below. The bed was rather low but I would rather this than that it was too high, although of course different things suit different people. It also had rather a strange headboard: the feeding trough from when this was a stable which made sitting up in bed a little bit difficult! There was a sofa in the room and also two upright chairs with arms, plus, unusually, tea and coffee making facilities. It's just an hour or so away from Calais, so if you need somewhere in the area and you want to treat yourselves to some gorgeous food then this is a great place. The château was the headquarters of the British Tank Command during World War I and they are planning to add a little museum at some point in the future.  The accessibility generally is a bit of a work in progress but they are intending to improve it and I was able to get around without a problem."
5627,Not many staff about but not really necessary. Those I saw were helpful. There are signs with a phone number if you needed assistance. 
5628,Start could not be more helpful.
5629,"Loo on ground floor opposite entrance to bar , very good. Accessible bathroom in room was huge. Had grab rails etc but as usual loo roll was perched on cistern. Excellent shower. Room had an upright chair useful if extra support needed getting in/out of bed."
5630,Red cord to the floor. All hand rails. 
5631,A large accessible toilet is available next to the Disability Snowsports UK office. The toilet also has showering facilities and lots of space for moving around. The size of the toilet was ideal for us as we were able to change our clothes without struggling for space. There was also a hoist but you need to bring your own sling.
5632,"On arriving there were 4 disabled spaces in the main car park. We got a space but when it is busy, this isn’t enough in terms of disabled spaces. Out of the car park you go slightly down hill via a ramped path past the café and shop area. Easy to navigate the path. Go straight past the grassed picnic benches area on your right, over the bridge and veer left onto the Devil’s Gorge path. There are some areas where you need to take extra care due to tree stumps and steep banks but generally good. Lovely nature walk."
5633,the toilet itself is in a large room. Appropriate bars in place and plenty of space to maneouver. it does double as a baby changing area. it isnt where the other bathrooms are but near the front entrance discretly placed and definately accessible but does seem a little out the way.
5634,"Guide is available at reception to show which paths are easily accessed independently and those where a bit of assistance is needed.  there are no steep hills but a few sloping pathways.  Most paths are metalled but some are over grassy or muddy areas, with tree roots which make access a bit more of a challenge."
5635,"The staff are exceptional. Usually I do a lot of checking about accessibility before I book accommodation but this time for personal reasons I hadn't had the time to do that. I put on my booking form that I wanted a room with a shower as I have a disability. When I went back downstairs to reception, after seeing my room, to talk to them about the shower, they were very approachable and went out of their way to fin a solution. They immediately checked their other rooms and also called their 2 sister hotels to see if they had an accessible room. They also suggested using the accessible shower room in the Genisis Health Suite. Initially I was not sure about this but it worked perfectly. They left a note on reception for someone to take me to the shower room when I telephoned them. This worked well. I really appreciated the staff's positive attitude to dealing with it, they were very customer focused and wanted to find a solution for me. The positive staff attitude was throughout my stay. Everyone from the front desk, waiting staff and cleaners always said hello and smiled when they saw me. The front desk always dealt with things quickly such as when I wanted to order a taxi or asking directions. The waiting staff were wonderful. You are allocated a table which you keep throughout your stay and service was always prompt even through the hotel as busy. They asked what I was doing and remembered what I told them and asked me how that particular activity went next time I saw them. "
5636,Good
5637,For the disabled this restaurant is not ideally situated with the only parking space  in nearby municipal car parks about a ten minute walk. 
5638,Cheerful.
5639,Walked to the venue but appeared to be parking outside 
5640,"Overall, the access was good and signage was clear. There were a few sections with loose stone which may make it a bit challenging for some wheelchair users."
5641,Friendly
5642,"It's city centre london, the bus stop was quite a bit away."
5643,"the newly refurbished building has good access on the ground floor, with enough well designed disabled toilets. The walkways are clutter free and easy to navigate. outside there is accessible parking spaces and parking is free. Staff are friendly , welcoming and happy to help."
5644,The corridors are very wide but there is no lift
5645,"This is a very welcoming Guest House. My 90 year old mother can walk a few yards with assistance, but uses mainly a wheelchair.  There are two huge twin ground floor rooms, very nicely decorated and with enormous bathrooms.  The bathrooms had shower cubicles, low level baths and low level sinks, with plenty of room to use a wheelchair if necessary.  Although my mum was able to make the single flight of stairs to the breakfast room,  there is the offer of having breakfast served in one's room if preferred.  There is a  ramp is to the separate rear entrance which leads to the main town square.  The owners are extremely helpful."
5646,"Right opposite entrance from pavement, step free."
5647,The lift is behind the travellators and next to trolleys. I noticed coming out the lift that there are not any signs or warnings for the stairs which I thought was quite dangerous.
5648,"Everyone we encountered was helpful, patiently explaining what was going to happen."
5649, I explain my  particular needs surrounding my  cerebral palsy. And  on this occasion one member of staff kindly broke  pompadoms  into smaller manageable pieces for me and    added the   Chutneys which I had ordered.  On previous visit the staff have always been friendly and approachable    And always willing   To bring me food  or drink from the   Buffet.
5650,"This is an excellent all-inclusive hotel. Most of the hotel is accessible, although there are some defiencies for people who can only use a wheelchair. My rating tries to reflect the overall quality of the place, but also tries to reflect that it does have some imperfections for the disabaled. In normal circumstances I'd give it 5 stars. Unfortunatley there are, as far as I know, no rooms adapted for disabled guests."
5651,"Ample space, wide smooth paths and accessible toilets dotted throughout - this really is a great accessible greenspace. I loved the wetland area with winding boardwalk, it had been raining and wasn't too slippy at all. The toilets I came across were clean and spacious, and the signposting throughout this park is fantastic. The cafes are all easily accessible too!"
5652,Plenty of lifts.   However it was quite busy so that maybe off putting to those that have sensory issues.
5653,"The entrance is level access and has a push pad operated automatic door. The pad is on the right hand side going in and out. Note when leaving, the door will open out towards you. The space between counter and rest of the shop is about 1.5 metres. "
5654,"Main Entrance has a Large revolving door which can be slowed down and stopped for disabled access using dedicated button All floors accessible by lift One way system in place with COVID restrictions on stairwells, clearly signposted Plenty of seating in foyer to rest, some areas are quite a walk for those with walking difficulties, but if you ask at the desk in the foyer, they will summon a volunteer to help you with a chair, and plenty of chairs available in the foyer, if you have someone to help you. Good signage, plenty regarding COVID safety measures, signage is much improved from when it was the main hospital Main sign includes information regarding where disabled toilets are allocated"
5655,"The way into the chapel involves two shallow steps with a handrail on both sides. There is also a platform lift, which is discreetly integrated into the pavement, see photo. There is level, step free access inside the chapel.  On entering you arrive at the ante chapel, which has marble plaques dedicated to the staff who worked there. Some of the plaques can only be comfortably read at standing height. There is a plaque to Diana Beck, the first female neurosurgeon in Europe.  Then there are large archways into the nave of the chapel and Baptistery. It is also here the information desk is. There are some seats in the Baptistery please be aware they swivel. Near the altar there are regular chairs. Although the chapel is small it is a hidden gem so when we visited there were only a couple of other people there.     There were information sheets but I didn't notice any large print or audio guides."
5656,They couldn't be more friendly and made every effort to help
5657,The access for wheelchairs is reasonable. 
5658,The entrance and all inner doors are wide and lifts serve all floors. Everything is at wheelchair height at reception.
5659,Very good if you drive. Blue badge holders can park at the door. Archway tube station is very close but it has limited access. There are buses that serve the area but I have used them.
5660,No disabled parking. Bus passes near hotel
5661,"I have found in German Airports especially - the attention to detail and provision o wide spaces, lifts and moving flat escalators is superb. Of toileting facilities most are standardised and excellent. You know what is available and they are well serviced. Good signage and direction."
5662,"Please note that the restaurant has moved from upper floors accessed by the Flannels lift and is now in the basement.  Initial access is tricky as it has a gradient - stay left for the most simple option. Once through the door there is a small area above a flight of stairs down (approx 10 stairs). There is no lift. For wheelchair users they have a system that connects to a wheelchair that can get you downstairs. It takes a few minutes to safely connect you (and my chair wouldn’t fit so I had to transfer to their chair) and then you are tilted back before the conveyor belt assists your down the stairs. I was glad I wasn’t wearing a dress, although the waiter got a view straight down my jumpsuit - poor man!  This was pretty undignified, but it meant I could access the restaurant.   Once down the restaurant was well laid out, tables at a good height for my standard chair and the accessible bathroom was pretty large. "
5663,Staff were very helpful and friendly.
5664,"parking was good, we used the pay and display area opposite the Sennedd building."
5665,Venue staff were friendly but not very clued up. Box office phone staff very helpful. There's a bit of a disconnect though.
5666,Maggie and her team are great.
5667,"Plenty of parking close to the entrance, and three dedicated parking spots for blue badge users. You can park here for free for up to 4 hours, but if you need more time you just sign your car in at reception. This gym is also just a stones throw away from Nottingham train station, making it the perfect place to go if you're travelling via train."
5668,I'm not a wheelchair user but there is a ramp.
5669,"We were last here in August 2012 and thought it was a nice place to visit. This year we are again staying at Landal Het Vennenbos and so a repeat visit was necessary. So much has changed and for the better. The car park is more organized, as is the entrance. A large number of the cages have been renovated and some removed, the zoo is being updated. The bird of prey section has had a massive improvement with what seems to be a flying area right down the centre. The birds seemed happy and alert in their sections. Definitely worth a visit."
5670,Easy to read clear signs for the doors on access to the building and on the toilet doors.
5671,We didnt speak to the staff
5672,Access in the Centre is really good. Dropped a point as it was difficult to get from the street up on to the pavement as no obvious dropped kerbs and loads of cars in the way.
5673,"All stations except Newtondale are accessible for wheelchair users with supervised crossings over the tracks. All stations except Levisham and Newtondale, have reasonably spacious and well equipped disabled toilets and there is already some trains with wheelchair spaces and good disabled toilet. Goathland has an accessible cafe and it's disabled toilet is in z stationary carriage."
5674,If you're on the hunt for jewellery in Glasgow this is definitely the place to go. Undercover with a smooth floored easy to access arcade and plenty of shops.
5675,"No parking at the venue, but there are disabled bays in town and you can park in residents' only bays in Oxford. Try St Giles or get a bus to central Oxford."
5676,There are a handful of blue badge space in each car park but you need to know which platform your train is going from to make sure you park in the correct place and avoid a hilly walk between them
5677,clean disabled toilets in almost every area. they had hand rails and it was easy to unlock the doors with staffs help if needed.
5678,Helpful staff
5679,Vehicle access excellent. The drive is steep so pushing a chair up it may not be a viable option but I think there may be other more suitable pedestrian routes.
5680,large accessible toilet with all the handles however emergency pull cord is disconnected and tied around a handle and the room is used to store high chairs. Yuck!
5681,"I am disappointed and disgusted, If your disabled or in a wheelchair DONT BOTHER.  ITS DOWN RIGHT DANGEROUS.  1st time to the British Grand Prix and I have also been to Spa and Germany.  They do it so much better. 2 hours to get into Disabled carpark at a cost of £75 for 3 days.  At least a 20 min walk (for walking)  no distinct path sometimes I actually got stuck in Gravel pits or stuck on massive rocks or no other way apart from over grass.  The slope up to the Disabled seating area was so steep I nearly upended on my wheelchair.  In addition you have to fight your way through the crowds there and back.  No cover on the ""Disabled"" seating area.  There were people there who had medical equipment or conditions that could have done with shelter, a ban on putting up any sort of shelter.  (Eventually by midafternoon was told you could use a small umbrella) And to top it off as Disabled bays are the furthest carpark I've spent nearly 3.5 hours getting out.  For the entry fee Silverstone you should be ashamed.  My husband spent the day worrying more about me than enjoying the races and it was his day."
5682,Very helpful staff.
5683,The staff I met were helpful and friendly.
5684,"The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby."
5685,Single 3 inch step into the venue. Once inside everything was level and there was space to move.
5686,Parking at the door of the lodge.
5687,"We were a group of four with one motorised wheelchair. My husband rang ahead to let them know about my mum’s chair which they said would be no problem. The service was great and cheerful  and the food delicious. They picked us a good table near the disabled toilet (but not on top of it). The disabled toilet was a decent size and had a cord and reset button within reach. It was also the most stylish we’ve used by far!  At one point we dropped a mask from a bag when rummaging for meds. Our waitress spotted this and brought us a new one in a little The Ivy envelope.  On the way out it was a bit narrow where people sat with their backs to the bar. The staff foresaw a squeeze and we’re proactive in asking a few people to pop up for a second.  Top marks! Sorry no photos, we were too engrossed in the food, drink and chat. "
5688,Completely level with a nice smooth floor. Half star deduction only reflects fact it is tight in some parts for a wheelchair when busy.
5689,"Accessibility was surprisingly good.  It was my first visit to the George Street Assembly Rooms and Music Hall so I had a look on their website. The information specifically about accessibility on the Assembly room site wasn't easy to spot but the search engine brought up the relevant info. There was also contact information, including an email address should you wish to clarify anything. "
5690,"Very helpful, the person at the food counter directly spoke to me and the self service counter the woman came over and was very polite in asking if I would like any assistance and was really helpful when the barcode would not scan in. "
5691,"Nearest bus station 3 or 4 minutes walk and plenty of on street parking. Didn't use any transport as staying nearby , but think it wouldn't be a problem at all"
5692,"There is an accessible loo in the corridor off of the main reception. There are more throughout the building if you are visiting a particular space, but this one is the best and most convenient! "
5693,"There is a car park at the station with plenty of space. Be warned - Bo'ness is quite a hilly place and the road we took that lead to the station from the bus stop was extremely steep.  If you're thinking of travelling to the Bo'ness end of the railway via public transport, before visiting I'd recommend researching local buses/taxi firms if you're a wheelchar user, or would struggle with steep inclines."
5694,There are disabled parking in the street nearby but it can take a while to get a space
5695,I had no difficulty parking near to venue. There is a disabled bay across the road outside the entrance to the Botanic Gardens on Queen Margaret Drive and two bays outside the library on Byres Road a short distance away. However you have to bear in mind this was a Sunday evening in a very busy park of the city. 
5696,"Lou who helped us was friendly and introduced herself, helped us find a show and supplied a seat.   I would not have attempted to go if I had not had help"
5697,"All on one level with ample and good communicative staff, before entering and once inside the store, given distancing and directional signage. The store is small with only 6 aisles and fixtures on each end, but more than spacious. "
5698,All very friendly and helpful.
5699,Dedicated large disabled toilets.
5700,"Very helpful staff, willing to discuss the use of cycle baby seats on adapted equipment."
5701,the cord is always tied up
5702,"I'm a football fan but am always uneasy when going to away games - so much so, in fact that the majority of the time I don't bother. It's too hard to book tickets and, whilst you're on the touch line, the view you get is so often sub-par. My mentality has always been, stick to Charlton's The Valley: the stadium I know best.  Why did nobody tell me about Watford before? I can't fault Vicarage Road. They have the best sensory room I've seen and are putting in a Changing Places toilets  (but I'm sure if you asked for a hoist they'd have one). Staff are so friendly and all they want to do is improve!  There's plenty of wheelchair spaces and more are being added. Up The Hornets. Let's follow their example!"
5703,Door opens inwards but very large room with grab rails etc.
5704,At entrance there was more staff to talk me through procedure all masked and sanitation and sterilizer given as I entered building. All staff reassuring and very professional and put me completely at ease I felt very safe
5705,"during a non match day you can park no bother at the Disabled bays. amongst the Edinburgh Rugby teams cars, so can see some nice cars and meet players no bother. on match day its different  over the years you can see they are trying. the Parking is free with a parking pass from Scottish rugby when you request it. however they moved us this year on a match day to the ice rink which doesnt have disabled bays and caused issues when the staff security tried to make cars park super close with no door room to transfer.  i raised this with the health and safety team who will look into it."
5706,very helpful and friendly
5707,really easy
5708,"There's plenty of parking though I only saw one marked disabled space, albeit close to the main entrance.  It's a bit out if the way so doubt if buses pass close by (though can't swear to it)."
5709,"Help was there if needed, but otherwise in the background."
5710,Staff helped with directions and moving chairs if required - happy to help.
5711,"I was unable to see a disabled toilet at Copacabana. Although the regular toilets were fairly easy to access (ie. no step) once in the building there was little space, I would imagine a wheelchair user would struggle with the lack of space and also the quality of these toilets was poor. For one of the busiest beaches in Dubrovnik I would also believe that only having 2 female toilets is not enough. "
5712,good boardwalk path all round the Moss. Steep short climb from carpark to boardwalk but not too bad.
5713,"Level paved access from both car parks. No electric doors into restaurant but easy to open. Flat access throughout restaurant which is divided into smaller rooms. Good amounts of space between tables, but could be a bit of a challenge if very busy. We reserved a table and staff had already moved one of the chairs to accommodate the wheelchair. Table tall enough to manoeuvre wheelchair underneath with feet still on footplates. "
5714,Regular buses up and down Leith Walk. East-bound stop just a few doors up. Taxi can drop off close by (some naughty taxi drivers will even stop on the zig zags directly outside!)
5715,accessible but no changing facilities/hoisting equipment.
5716,"The first row of parking all the way around the complex has additional space blocked out on each side, allowing for car doors to be fully opened.  Transport to this venue is fairly limited unless you would be driving, there are a few buses that do stop, however the bus stop is in the middle of the car park, so to get to the main pathway you would need to cross traffic.  "
5717,"Venue had a level car park (fee still payable by blue badge holders), although venue was on road with double yellow line allowing three hour free parking with blue badge, and this ended up being closer to venue than payable car park. "
5718,"We sadly found it difficult to get into hotel, after parking really close to hotels entrance, (photo 6) the front steps are far to steep to get up, so it means using the ramp that is situated close by, (see photo 7) but then it was a hard push to get up the slope, and do turn left at the top of first slope, as it’s not signed where to go then, so follow our (photo 8)  and turn left, do not go up the rest of the ramp. Follow it round the corner and you will come to big door, with a notice and a bell  (photo 9) Staff will come quite quickly to let you in and will show you to reception. "
5719,"When travelling by train I always use the ""Passenger Assist ""Service. In my experience it works very well  and is ""tailor made"" to suit your own requirements. Accessibility for a disabled person at Darlington Train Station is not good. If you arrive at the station by taxi or can be dropped off by a friend then it is level access to the booking office and to the trains, but if you arrive in your own transport the surrounding car parks are useless as the route from one car park involves a steep incline which, in my opinion, will beat most wheelchair users, and the other car park is connected to the station by steps! "
5720,N/a
5721,The staff are very friendly and obviously trying hard. I'm sure any lack of customer service is down to inexperience.
5722,The taxi company offer a range of tours. I booked Roque de Los Muchachos.  I travelled in a 8 seater minibus.
5723,One toilet with no access problem but not large..
5724,"Friendly and helpful staff, ready and willing to assist"
5725,"Easy access to the 2 main openings into the gardens, all ground level.  Footpaths are suitable for majority of manual and electric wheelchairs. Although, near woodland areas the slope slightly increases which many become difficult and tiring for the person or carer.   Plenty of benches situated around the gardens to take a rest.   Clear signs around identifying areas and information about some artchiteceture.  Easy access to the grass area around the band stand, as well as some steps.  "
5726,Above ground museum is fully accessible with ramps and level access.   There is an underground tour for wheelchair users. You will have to be able to transfer into one of the museum's wheelchairs and will need a companion to push you around underground. The lift underground is an old mining lift with a slight lip to get in. Underground the route is acceptable but there are a few bumps and rails along the way so be careful. 
5727,"Level access from street to the lobby. Lift from lobby to music hall, then level access straight through to the venue."
5728,"This place has thought of access well, some areas are inaccessible but the main part of the interior bar and all of the outside is accessible. Plenty space around tables and aisles. "
5729,"Upon arrival there are various clear signs suggesting a wheelchair friendly alternative route. There are several steps at the entrance, but an access ramp runs adjacent to these. A wheelchair user is able to see the animals and exhibitions clearly due to the transparent edging, for example the glass windows or fences. There is also an interactive area where anybody can feed and interact with the animals, with an accessible walkway for wheelchairs, push chairs etc. The signs locating the way to the animal exhibitions are large and colourful, making them easy to see. There are various cafes, all offering wheelchair access. Most have wide double doors that remain open, allowing a wheelchair to pass through easily and safely. "
5730,"Super access particularly in house, but so much better than have experienced elsewhere.  Needed powerpack on my wheelchair as there are a few minor slopes to takle in the grounds.  The footpaths were compacted hardcore which caused the chair to lose grip a couple of time, but they were even.  Staff were most Helpfull and friendly.  The disabled toilet facilities easily accommodated my chair and there were suitably places grab rails and  emergency pull cord, most importantly they were clean."
5731,"Staff were helpful, informative and attentive."
5732,Mainly slopes but lifts are also available indoors.
5733,The staff are always happy to help if you require assistance.
5734,"Great staff and very helpful but one or two things could improve. Access on mobility scooter needs some very skilled driving, which I don’t have!  Some very narrow turns through train carriage and coming out of cells.  Staff were really helpful and opened staff only doors I managed to escape unscathed.   We knew before hand that I wouldn’t be able to access part of the museum  on left hand side but even accessing the first floor required someone to remove barriers and then on way back you are constantly going against the flow.   My husband visited the second & third floors and I returned to main entrance as I was directed but no one was about to open barriers.  Thankfully a very nice visitor removed it for me but it does make you feel uncomfortable. Toilets good and cafe had plenty of room. "
5735,The accessible toilets in entrance 5 have a left and also a right opening door ie. 2 disabled toilets. One of the accessible toilets in entrance 6 is operated by a Radar key and is a large room with a hoist and sink with adjustable height!
5736,"Automatically opening doors lead to 3 lifts to access the 1st floor reception area and restaurant. As with many accommodation providers the idea that a disabled person may have a carer and a child seems to confuse them. After a brief wait we were lead to a large r with a hastily added 3rd bed, but there was still plenty of space and a huge wet room. "
5737,Excellent facilities which met and exceeded our expectations.  Everything you needed for the less able bodied within our party.  Nothing was too much trouble.  They even recommended True Care Domicillary Care who also were excellent and provided a fantastic service.
5738,We drove to the Zoo which had ample parking with many overflow car parks as you go up a hill. The disabled parking was located the closest to the zoo at the bottom of the hill to allow for easier access. 
5739,"The access inside the property was very good. The floors were wooden, but some had loose coverings (rugs) and these had to be rolled up and moved as they don't work with a wheelchair! The thresholds on the exterior doors were quite high and I was not able to manage them independently. This is not a criticism but shows that access is an individual thing!"
5740,Valley View is all ground floor - spacious bathroom/bedroom/kitchen with tons of space to turn. Wheelchair user popped in and out of the cottage no bother and could access Branmbles barn as all the door ways are wide. 
5741,"The staff were extremely helpful from assisting with access to venue and facilities but as I was there alone they frequently popped by the viewing area to see if I needed anything, and the other patrons in the place were also friendly and welcoming should I need anything from the bar."
5742,"Friendly staff but sadly, this facility is not welcoming to those with visual and hearing impairment.    I use hearing aids and visited the building with a friend who has visual impairment. We both struggled to enjoy the experience because the building did not meet our needs.   The building was acoustically uncomfortable, excessively so. Two children were interacting with one of the installations and behaving perfectly appropriately, but the noise they generated spread and echoed off the walls. A few more people arrived and their chatter added to the noise. In total, it took just six people in the room to make it very uncomfortable for me.   There is a theatre and there is a hearing loop within it.  Great! BUT there is NO signage outside the theatre and only a VERY small sign inside, and it is on the far wall. I only spotted it because i have good eyesight and was looking. The loop itself seems of nice sound quality BUT the volume is set too low.  Another hearing aid user (who went in to check my view) agreed with this.   For those with visual impairment, there appears to be NO adjustment made to accommodate requirements.  There is a huge map, which is the main feature in the building and a digital tablet is provided to engage with it.  The font size is small and cannot be adjusted.  BAsically, it is usable for those with some degree of sight loss. It also requires people to have GOOD DEXTERITY because it is fiddly to use.   All the main installations come with written information. There is also information boards telling the story of Scotland's architectural heritage. The text is fairly small and there appears to be NO audio alternative.    I hope that facility managers will re-think their accessibiliy standards. I imagine that our every-increasing older population might find it interesting but given that most older people have some degree of hearing and / or sight loss, the building is pretty unsuitable for them.  What a shame!"
5743,Very friendly staff team - you order your food at the counter but everything (including drinks) are brought over to the table when they're ready. 
5744,All 4 lodges have huge wet-room.  2/4 lodges have Clos-o-May toilets.  All ground floor toilets are accessible- with one facilitating a left side transfer and the other a right side transfer. Grab rails around both the toilet and shower areas.  Ample space for carers to assist. Selection of S hower chairs and trolleys available for showering. 
5745,Flat access into main hotel and flat path to get to garden rooms
5746,"Driving here was a pleasure, it’s through pleasant countryside, and inviting looking inn as you arrive. No disabled bays, but all parking reasonably close to entrance anyway. "
5747,The Pleasance has tried hard to make the Courtyard venues accessible for wheelchair users. Finding a solution to cobbles would be good - but overall a great chance to enjoy Nish Kumar's comedy in an accessible converted portacabin!
5748,Nothing to make it hard to get in - staff will rush to open the door for you. It's atmospherically cosy/gloomy so those with restricted vision may want to bring a torch!
5749,"My first visit to the Music Room.Access is directly from the street and has level access.Seating is unreserved and either at tables or  in rows.We were late arriving at sat in the rows of seats ,moving  a seat  for my wheelchair.There is a bar in the room and toilets are just outside with easy access and two accessible toilets.The staff were extremely helpful and I would recommend this venue."
5750,"Very easy to get in, lots of space, wide doorway and built in ramp access. As soon as I entered I was greeted by a friendly member of staff. I asked to use the toilet and get a take away cup of tea, the man showed me where the toilet was and offered to remove the baby changing table but I still fit in. There was plenty of space for me to move around, I did transfer into one of the seats at the table. "
5751,"Helpful up to a point, some better than others."
5752,"Various shorter flat trails to visitor farm, café  & playpark (through cobbled courtyard).  Trail goes downhill to riverside- accessible in a pavement scooter."
5753,"Parking on street outside, wide doors and level access. A Hibees dream ..."
5754,Wide doors to the entrance and lots of space inside. Only tricky bit is the big and heavy doors to get in. Definitely couldn't manage on your own (particularly as it can get very windy).
5755,"Needless to say that as it is an old lady of the sea the doorways and some of the turns are very tight. They do have some wheelchairs there that you can swap over to for the tour. If in doubt ask them to measure your chair so as to save getting stuck going around. The tour is explained to you via a telephone shaped device that explains where you are and a bit of in depth information about that part of the yacht.  There is a tearoom about half way around but as my friends and I never went in due to the length of the queue I can't comment on it. It is an interesting tour, if you want like that sort of thing, consisting of a lot of looking and listening.  I would not recommend this tour for anyone who is concidering walking around who has mobility problems. It is a long walk and I spent a lot of time looking for somewhere to sit and rest. Her Majesty has a lot of furniture with nice soft arms on them.  I will say that I enjoyed the tour being ex-forces and having heard lots of stories about the yacht. "
5756,There is parking facilities and the hotel is perfect for Heathrow airport. There is just a short bus ride to the underground Piccadilly line to take you into central London.
5757,"Good - just a couple of places where you cross roads to get from one area of the park to another, and the drop-downs are a bit bumpy. The paths through the park should be fine for someone self propelling in a manual chair. Access to the facilities at the centre of the animal closure involves passing two heavy gates but other visitors were quick to help with these."
5758,"Rugby World Cup 2015, had the privilege of attending the stadium twice for Scotland Group Games. Access to the Gallowgate and Leazes End by lift, well stewarded - stewards in attendance on the stadium periphery to guide you through the crowds, and then to and from the appropriate lift to your seat in the stadium. Recommended is to seek a wheelchair space in the Leazes End - 7th floor, stunning views across to Gateshead with a view of the action you can't match at pitch side. Once inside, the atmosphere generated is electric. The thing I liked most was that often attending sports stadia, you find the wheelchair spaces to be designated away from the rest of the supporters. Here, you can be very much feel part of the crowd, at the heart of the atmosphere,  thanks to the cleverly thought out wheelchair space plan. "
5759,"Nice and pleasant, chatty without being overly chatty."
5760,"Very helpful, gave free entry for disabled person and half price to carer. Offered use of wheelchair, which was very useful as it's a huge space to negotiate."
5761,"Friendly, attentive and discreet service - alert but not intrusive. One star lost for their failure to understand that the red emergency cord in the toilet must hang freely all the way to the floor."
5762,Plenty of parking at the water-sports centre including 3 wheelchair bays.
5763,"Disappointing on many counts. Step-free entrance locked, no tables suitable for wheelchair users, the way to the toilet blocked by large packing boxes."
5764,"Really great. Lots of wide smooth paths, no obstructions to viewing the duck pond which has lots of moorhens, mallard ducks and even the odd cormorant. There isn't a barrier between the bath and the pond though, so take care! Saw lots of seating around the park too if you need to stop and take a rest."
5765,"The staff are charming, friendly, helpful and thoughtful. Top marks!"
5766,Very accessible.  Very friendly and helpful staff.
5767,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced.
5768,"Staff very helpful at the ticket office. Helped with choosing best price ticket, train details and how to find the platform."
5769,"Super, new design, built in. Everything easy to access. "
5770,"As we approached the old 17th century coaching inn, from the road it looked quite nice, golden brown stonework with lots of character, and a archway entrance for car park, which did not seem to belong to the hotel, but to a complex of various outlets, but it is very, very narrow, and with a big car such as ours, we barely made it through. There were two disabled bays right against the building, very awkward to park in place, as wanting to leave room for other cars to pass without damaging our car. There is drop down barrier, which indicates it’s a paying car park, but the two bays belong to hotel, and we were not charged, and did not have to register our car, but it’s a very grotty place, and difficult to turn round, as you have to go out via that narrow bridge entrance, so we were not impressed at all. Once inside hotel, we were very disappointed, it was dark throughout, ( I have tried to show this with the photographs ) badly in need of maintenance and re-decoration. It is a very old building and furniture was designed to keep that effect, which did not work and gave the hotel no appeal at all. The reception area was small and dark and dingy, very uninviting. We had coffee break in the lounge area by reception desk, and it looked dusty. The coffee itself was hot and strong, nicely presented, and we could sit and reflect that we were pleased we were not staying overnight here. The bar lounge was uninspiring, again dark and poorly lit, and not comfortable looking. The restaurant didn’t look to bad though, you might be tempted to try a meal here, but it lacked character.  The ladies and gents toilet were along a corridor, but I did not find a disabled toilet. They were not easy to get into, with pull handles which had to be pulled down, making it very difficult to get in to use toilets. Clean and tidy with one cubicle, for men, but practical more than stylish. The private function room was not appealing, and again dark. You will by now have gathered that we cannot in anyway recommend this hotel for disabled, let alone able bodied person, and hope management can improve this hotel before too long."
5771,It's a straight and easy to navigate street. Level surfaces and dropped kerbs where required.
5772,"A wheelchair accessible restaurant with friendly and helpful staff, happy to answer any questions and excellent service."
5773,"Access in and around the building:  The steps and door to the building were fairly easy to find as I was with a companion. At the door we were greeted by a member of staff and shown the reception which was helpful.  Once inside the building we were shown around. Getting to the rooms required the use of the lift or stairs. Interestingly, and helpfully, the corridors by the lift were painted bright green, in other places different colours – this all aided navigation.  I loved the large door numbers and even more so the lighting above the door which made them easier to find. As well as helping with locating the door lock. The bold pink stripe to the side of the door was also a great feature.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  Once in the accessible room them was plenty of space. Good use of colour contrast and lighting.  Access in the dining area:  The bold use of colour and good lighting made the dining area a great environment.   Access to other facilities:  The bar was bright and light with a choice of seating."
5774,"Accessibility to the hotel was really very good,  a specious building. Out room was large and had a very helpful ceiling hoist. Also very friendly concierge service"
5775,Friendly. Professional. 
5776,Nothing was too much
5777,The accessible toilet was easy to find and was located near the reception. It is rather large which means there is enough room to maneuver and also have a carer present. The toilet was clean and tidy and was cleaned regularly which was monitored on the wall. 
5778,Automatic doors at entrance. Toilet with wheel chair access on ground floor. Lift access to all floors.
5779,The staff were friendly and welcoming. 
5780,Good circulation space around the museum. One of our party has a vision impairment and found the reduced lighting of the Titanic Exhibition a challenge but used the large print descriptions to aid understanding of the exhibits. 
5781,We asked the staff at the museum who kindly told us the most accessible way to get to Fort Charlotte which was up 2 steep slopes and then across a road into the Fort.  
5782,"The theatre is step-free throughout the ground floor and to the stalls seats. There is an agreeable but cramped bar, you will have to do some delicate negotiation to get around all the chairs and tables, but that's a small point."
5783,"There is on-street parking right outside Zest, with no time limit and free to Blue Badge holders only. There are designated Blue Badge parking spaces nearby. Parking is   £1.10 per hour for other vehicles, with a two-hour maximum stay. There is a parking meter just 5 metres from the café entrance. Emerging from the rear of a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, care is required as access is directly onto the busy road. The nearest dropped kerb is at the nearby mini roundabout. There are moveable tables outside on the street, with a canopy for cover. The streets around the café are paved, with a slight camber.  St Andrews can be reached by the main roads A91, A917, and A915. The nearest railway station is Leuchars, 10.2 miles or 16km away, approximately 20 minutes by car or bus. Accessible taxis can be booked in advance - contact Williamsons on 01334 476787. There is a regular bus service from Dundee via Leuchars station into St Andrews, Stagecoach route no.99 has low floor access, wheelchair access and Wi-Fi. All no.99 buses go to St Andrews bus station. Bus timetables can be found at https://www.stagecoachbus.com/timetables.The café is a 15-minute walk from the bus station. "
5784,Very easy on the lower level - lots of space to get to the counter and around the tables. The upper level has steps and I couldn't see how a wheelchair user would get there but the lower level is large and had plenty spaces to sit when we visited.
5785,"We drove and parked in one of the 2 disabled bays by the front door, but there is also lots of parking at the rear. There is a bus Stop ID: oxfamwmd right opposite it but it is not the easiest road to cross on foot."
5786,"By National Rail  Glasgow Central Station & Glasgow Queen Street Station   By Subway  St Enoch Station & Buchanan Street Station  By Bus 1,1A,1B,1C,100,359,X4 stop @ Buchanan Bus station  There is no parking available on site, but there's public parking nearby. "
5787,"There is an excellent accessible toilet spoilt by two features. (1) the door into the toilet lobby is terribly heavy and stiff, not at all wheelchair-user-friendly - one star lost for this (2) the red emergency cord had been tied to the handrail in a complex knot, and was consequently useless to anyone who might need it in an emergency.  See my photo below. Two stars lost for this piece of crass thoughtlessness."
5788,"If you can't climb steps, you can't access Wimpole Hall, at all, which is very disappointing. On the day I visited, we just went to a craft fair in the grounds and to the courtyard area, so I'm not sure what access to Wimpole Farm is like. The parts we visited were very poor as far as access goes. The path from the car park to the courtyard  was basically earth with potholes, which on a rainy day was very difficult for my husband pushing my chair. To be fair, we could have taken a longer route, but that wasn't much better and there were no signposts to indicate a more accessible route. The courtyard is cobbled with brick stones and a boarded route would have been helpful to reduce the bone-rattling experience endured by my husband and myself. The main shop is difficult to access as the aisles are narrow, and I couldn't get in some of the smaller shops at all."
5789,"There was no disabled parking, it was what looked like an abandoned yard, full of hideous pot holes,.. Made the whole trip a frightening experience, being unsteady on feet, with all the issues that a stroke has,   "
5790,Toilets are easily accessible *I've only checked female toilet. The cubicle is large and there is room to side transfer to the right of the toilet for left side transferring from chair. However there are no grab rails so if you require them you might struggle. Toilet is all painted white with a light colour floor so colour contrast is not brilliant but it's a (usually) clean usable facility.
5791,Always friendly and helpful.
5792,Getting to the store by public transport was fairly easy as buses stop in St. Andrew Square. There's also a tram stop right outside the door. The Square also has some on street parking.
5793,"It has been many years since we have stayed at this hotel and have to say it met most of our requirements. I do not know what kind of glazing the room had but it certainly shut out any road noise.  With dual aspect windows, one also could look down to Ocean Terminal and across the dock area.   The bed was large and comfortable, although the duvet cover hardly me the sides of the bed when we were in it.  We found Breakfast as expected from previous stays in other Holiday Expresses, with a good choice from either scrambled eggs, sausages and  baked beans or continental breakfast option if one preferred. Unfortunately we never found the cereals but again, we ought to have asked."
5794,A number of accessible toilets with a variety of fittings and space sizes - very well described on their web-site.
5795,"Ramp and no steps, fantastic."
5796,"We parked in the nearest public car park which was about ten minutes push away. On the way back we passed a bay in the Main Street just opposite the castle - however the markings were so faded, they were hard to make out when right next to them let alone in a car! Didn't see any closer blue badge parking or any parking dedicated to castle visits.    Buses must pass through  Barnard Castle but not sure where they stop."
5797,"Parking was reasonable, multi-storey with disabled bays nearby. We parked on nearby double yellow lines using Blue Badge"
5798,One room of nongendered toilets including one disabled cubicle. Main door to this area not large - potentially a challenge to open it. Red cord too short. Cubicle a bit small to manoeuvre in. 
5799,"For a golf club, obviously mainly designed for golfers, it is very disabled-friendly."
5800,"The parking spaces were good, lots of them and nice and wide etc.  It's a shame however that you have to pay so much to park there, I know it's to encourage public transport use but when you're in a wheelchair it's not that easy.  I would have given more but the cost added to nearly 25 minutes to get out because of sheer volume of traffic trying to get through 2 barriers and I think that there must be a better way!!"
5801,"TICKETED MOAT AREA:  Access arrangements for people with tickets to go inside the moat, as listed on the Tower of London's website, are excellent, and deserve 5 stars. It states that ""the route through the installation is a step-free path that is approximately 900 metres long and covered with trakway. It has been designed to be accessible for all visitors and will have a ramp at the entrance and exit for easy accessibility."" There are ""audio described sessions for visually impaired visitors 06 and 07 November at 18:00 and 19:00. You will be asked to meet your guide 30 minutes before your timeslot. Transcripts of the Yeoman Warder introductions at the start of each time slot will be available with large-print versions. There will be a BSL interpreter on site on the 09 November who will be signing introductions for the 18:00 and 19:00 sessions. During time slots when there is no interpreter, transcripts (small and large print) will be available for the Yeoman Warder introductions at the start of each time slot. (They) have lanyards available if you would like to discreetly alert event staff to the fact that you may need extra time, help, or assistance.""  FREE VIEWING ACCESS FROM TOWER HILL AND TOWER CONCOURSE:  I arrived about 8.15pm, so was there for the last 45 minutes of the evening. When I arrived the area was crowded. From Tower Hill I managed to get to the front of the railings and was able to look down on the installation from street level. This provided a good view, but there was a lower path with people on it so it felt a little distant. Also from street level at Tower Hill there are trees and shrubs so there is not an uninterupted view. I then walked round to the Tower Concourse. The Tower Concourse is on a slope. There are information boards here about the event, however there is no reference on them to accessibility. To view the moat from here there was a large queue, this was at 8.15pm, so I assume it may well have been even busier earlier on. The area is fenced off so it involves walking up and down the length of the concourse several times to reach the area adjacent to the moat. At the entrance to the fenced off area there was a steward, my disability is visable but she didn't offer an alternative route for me to take. Luckily when I got parallel to the exit, the steward saw me and opened the fence and let me through so I went via the exit. Looking down from the Tower Concourse there is no seats. I found a space to view and I decided to stay there for the rest of the evening and I found it deeply moving."
5802,"Spacious accessible toilet, you have to go through the door marked as the gents toilet into a corridor that has the accessible toilet."
5803,"3 disabled parking bays, but the car park was loose gravel (although not as deep as in other areas)"
5804,"Courteous and helpful - each and very one. They will take you to the lifts, loo etc if they think it's difficult for you to find your way."
5805,"Very good access for an overnight stay. Wheelchair accessible room was excellent and easily large enough for two power chairs.  Automated main door to the hotel, lifts to all floors, accessible bedrooms close to lifts and facilities. Tables and chairs in dining area moveable to enable good wheelchair access."
5806,3 disabled spaces next to beer garden/entrance.  Spaces on sloping site so not so good for rear access.
5807,"For graduation days, a nearby zone is reserved for disabled car parking. Only cars who have booked to use these spots, and show their valid blue badge on the day may use these spaces. There are other small areas dotted around campus that are accessible with a blue badge, but on the whole car parking on campus is not viable. There are several nearby bus stops on prominent bus routes, and also a rank of taxis outside the famous clock-tower on Woodhouse Lane. The pavement is smooth and mostly level, making pedestrian access ideal."
5808,Staff were accommodating and understanding of specific needs. 
5809,Not really the place to go for a drink in a wheelchair. My personal view!.  But where would the adventure be?
5810,Signage is good. There are five permanent hearing loops installed all of them were working. One not working very well - regularly checked
5811,"Brilliant large, easy to use and large accessible loos."
5812,Outside toilet which is accessible but did feel exposed and there was a queue.
5813,We took a bus to Covent Gardens earlier In the day and then later walked to Seven Dials Hawksmoor.
5814,"Has its own large free car-park, with many marked disabled spaces all in a line nearest the entrance/pavement.  Pavement is also flat - no kerb- so easy to get onto in a wheelchair.  Haven't used public transport to it, I think there are buses to the area."
5815,"This is part one of THREE reviews, do read the others for a full view of what’s available here.  Part ONE Resort World Birmingham, (includes review for Genting Hotel. Part TWO Miller and Carter Restaurant, ( our 5* star restaurant review)  Part THREE MOXY HOTEL  Arriving by train is the least complicated way to arrive here, although it involves quite a bit of walking for your carer. For train details (See our review, just search for NEC, then on location type in Birmingham, look for National exhibition centre, then look at Disabled Traveller for more details.   If arriving by train or car, again more on this below, on section Parking and Transport  options. DO READ THESE for advice.  PARKING COSTS. During December 2021 and until further notice, it will cost you £2.50 for two hour parking.   IF YOU GO OVER 2 hours then it will be £16.00 ouch However, if you spend £20.00 anywhere in World resort, say on shopping, or restaurants, take your parking ticket with you and get it stamped at the shop or restaurant, and you will then only have to pay the £2.50 cost of ticket.  Oh that’s better, and that lasts for 12 hours parking for you.  It’s a nice place to go and see, right by the NEC halls, and alongside a lovely lake,  there’s enough to do and see for a short visit, or simply to enjoy a longer stay with restaurants to fill you up. Our photos will guide you as to how to spend your time here, but it’s certainly interesting to check out. Having arrived by train you exit the NEC by the bus stops (photo 1) with a view across to Resort World (photo 2) then you can chose which path to follow to get you inside (photo 3).  Arriving by car, you park by the  “shops sign”. (photo 4) and take the lift up to level “0” (photo 5) and come out to walk along by shops (photo 6) then walk along towards the lift and escalator (photo 7) and here your enquiries can be answered at the Guest Services desk (photo 8).  Close by are toilets (photo 9) and there is a disabled toilet for you (photo 10) which is roomy, with grab rails and a pull cord.   The Resort has its own Hotel entrances (photo 11) the Genting Hotel (photo 12) and the reception desk is a classy elegant space (photo 13) with a nice place to sit and relax (photo 14) and at the far corner you will find disabled toilets (photo 15) which is spacious enough, nicely tiled, and of course clean, with grab rails and pull cord (photo 16).  But this is an unusual Hotel, it’s used just for your bedroom facilities, all meals are taken in one of the Resorts restaurant of your choice, your coffee breaks will have to be elsewhere, but it’s handy and well looked after, so perhaps that may not matter to you. You simply exit the Hotel by reception desk (photo 17) take a lift and go up to your rooms level (photo 18) and enjoy your stay.  We were not given permission or help to be able to see what the rooms are like, but we imagine that they would be very nice, as the rest of the Hotel is, so advising you as to staying here is difficult for us.  Our final thoughts Well worth a visit, pleasantly surprised at the low costs of shopping and dining, with enough to do to pass time away. We certainly would recommend the Miller and Carter restaurant to you, excellent food and drinks, with moderate prices as well. The Genting Hotel was very nice for what we were allowed to see. Remember, it does have a cinema, a bowling alley, many restaurants, and across the road an adventure park, so give it a try while in the area.   "
5816,The box office staff were very helpful when I booked to check there was enough space for my power chair and kindly directed us to the accessible entrance to the theatre.
5817,"This is a very large store, so good if you want to get everything in one place. The access is very good, but it is very busy most of the time, it may be worth arranging assistance before you arrive.  Isles are wide, so there should be no problems getting around. As a visually impaired person I found it diffcult to find a lot of products because the place is so vast. I will ask for help next time."
5818,"Site follows curves and mounds of a giant human statue so there are many undulating hills which are not really accessible. Perimeter path fully accessible (level,some loose chippings, regular benches).  Venture up some of the gentle paths (some are loose chippings others grassy) round by the ponds and there are nice views. I have a power trike which managed fine apart from one little nudge from my companion. Don't be tempted to try one of the paths to the top - too steep for wheelchairs and too narrow to turn up the top. There's a photo showing me and a choice of paths going up - we took the very lowest one which gently wound its way up the side of the hill (not to the top)."
5819,"The cinema is on two floors, downstairs the seats are four around a table, upstairs it is traditional cinema seating. The seats around tables are very comfortable and swivel so that they are accessible to people who have disabilities. Wheelchairs can be placed by the ramp if not needed for seating during the film. This is a very popular cinema built in the 1930s, closed in 1988 then refurbished and re-opened in 2004."
5820,"Super helpful! Told me about the Palace, and heard them assisting others with directions."
5821,I was dropped off next to the venue where there is a drop off/ pick up area but there is a small car park next to it with dedicated disabled parking spaces
5822,If you pick your time right you'll be fine getting (no radar key needed) and there is ample space to manoeuvre around.
5823,We used toilets in restaurants so wasn't too aware of public loos.
5824,"I used the accessible toilet in the Imaging Department. The nurse showed me where it was. On the door is an image of a man and a woman and a toilet. Written on the door is patient WC and underneath is signage in braille. There was nothing on the door to indicate it was an accessible toilet. However inside there was a brand new, spacious accessible toilet with grab rails and emergency cord. There were even coat hooks on at two different heights (sorry my photo chopped the coat hooks off). It was clean and tidy and a pleasure to use.   In the reception area there was one sign indicating an accessible toilet.   I noted that there were a separate baby changing and baby feeding areas. I mention it in this section, as often baby changing facilities are in the accessible toilet, and often I've been places where I have had to wait while the facilities were being used for baby changing or vice versa.     I feedback to reception about the lack of signage on the accessible toilet and she will follow that up  with her manager.  I also asked if they had a Changing Places toilet and staff didn't know what one was. So again I raised that."
5825,"Great accessibility,staff are so helpful,asked about eating they showed us to a table and asked if it was suitable,then pointed out the disabled toilet. Plenty of roam for the wheelchair both in the garden center and the shop. Great!"
5826,Excellent! All areas accessible and I could see everything I wanted. There are one or two tanks that you can actually climb into but I couldn't get into those but all the others were laid out with plenty of room to wheel around them.  We didn't go outside on our visit due to the weather so can't comment on the accessibility of the outside unfortunately.
5827,"There was barrier free access from the car park to reception, the restaurant and to our room. It looked like all accessible rooms, like ours, were on the ground floor.  There are only two floors; there is a lift.  "
5828,"3 marked parking spaces are available at the front of the building....but its a large area, and to be honest, last time I went, we parked on double yellows as its legal to do that anyway!"
5829,"Staff were excellent. On the day of the show I realised there was tiered seating. I emailed the box office, they emailed me back and they reserved me a step free seat on the front row.   On the evening staff were friendly and welcoming. At the box office I was told were the lift was rather than having to ask where it was. When I arrived at the Upstairs staff took me to my reserved seat. I had a fabulous seat."
5830,"Large toilets with grab rails fitted at the right places, has raised toilet seat, has plenty of space for a wheelchair to move around. Clean and well maintained. There are available disabled toilets on both floors and in both sides."
5831,We stayed here for a few days. The room had rails around it to which bars and a shower seat were fitted where you want them. Good quality. Staff lovely and helpful. Room huge so no problems with moving about. Outdoor lift from carpark and designated disabled bays. Good disabled loo by restaurant. Nothing too much trouble for staff
5832,"Went to Hovertravels disabled access day today.  'Try before you fly'.   All staff at the event were brilliant.  Welcoming, knowledgeable and extremely patient and helpful."
5833,Staff are friendly and helpful and if they do not know the answer they are more than happy to find someone who does
5834,Disabled parking is directly down the hill. I would advice to use a powerchair or a carer who pushes your wheelchair.
5835,Busy location but once there it does have many disabled parking spaces so no problems. Don't know about nearby buses.
5836,"Tapas restaurant in a charming square in La Ranilla, the old Fistermen's Quarters, with good vegetarian options. "
5837,"The Mall which the cinema is located in, has various parking lots each with plenty of disabled parking spots right in front of the mall entrance which is very convenient for the individuals using the space. Once inside the mall, elevators can be found almost everywhere and an elevator can be taken to reach the cinema on the top floor. "
5838,Mostly volunteers as the cafe is a Community run concern.
5839,We travelled from Baltimore airport to the hotel in a wheelchair accessible taxi. There are very few wheelchair accessible taxis in Baltimore/Washington D.C.. We had to call a specific taxi company when we arrived at the airport  to request a wheelchair accessible taxi. The ride was a little uncomfortable and bumpy but we did manage to squeeze ourselves and our luggage in.  Although when we initially arrived at the hotel we did not need a parking space it was good to know that the hotel had an unground car park. There is also a metro station (foogy bottom) approximately 0.6 Miles from the hotel.
5840,Never had a issue with them they are willing to help if a issue
5841,Disabled toilets situated at the main entrance. They were quite tight though.
5842,"Great large area allocated for disabled people near the entrance.  We get the bus, and always tend to get the wrong one, but this time we got the right one, you want to get the X37 or the 47 that go straight past Ikea, the 37 kinda goes an awkward route around it. "
5843,The staff made my visit. The warm welcome and the time spent explaining the building and it purpose was enough to make me decide to have a return visit to explore further!
5844,We drove to Southampton and used the blue badge parking spaces offered by the parking company. On our return our car was very close to the terminal - delightful.
5845,Great Access throughout the Stadium
5846,Friendly
5847,Staff helpful 
5848,"The Centre has loads of shops all with easily accessible open fronts. There's plenty of space to walk around and wide enough so we could walk as two powerchair users side by side and have a conversation; can't do that in most places.  The surface was easy to wheel on, the areas clearly signposted, and the atmosphere really welcoming. So much so we hoping to revisit when we're next in Glasgow and have more time to browse."
5849,"Toilet as described above. One suction-type grab rail available, which you can put to the left side of the toilet, which is a standard toilet."
5850,Park and Ride site so regular low floor buses from various stops around York. Lots of disabled parking spaces. If you follow the signs for mobility then there is a mini car park just for blue badge holders. Flat access from car park to entrance.
5851,"Visited with our family as a get together as a birthday treat for our son Craig who is profoundly physically disabled with complex needs.  Homelands Trust more than met those needs, the accommodation is superb, fitted out to the highest standard with top of the range equipment and was spotlessly clean on our arrival.  The staff at Homelands were very friendly, approachable, and were able to accommodate our request for equipment to suit his requirements.  Knowing that we were coming for Craig's birthday, they even left out a birthday card for him, a real surprise.  We had a delightful stay and all of us agreed that we will return again many times in the future, many thanks to all."
5852,"2 doors on endearing the building (small space between the two) with large handles, slightly heavy to push/pull open."
5853,No steps throughout and accessible entrances.
5854,Outstanding! Completely separate private room of a good size. The lost 1/2 star is because it's almost impossible to find and again it's a bit of a maze to get to it.
5855,"Friendly, ask what you need and are not patronising"
5856,"Plenty of off road parking on the driveway, all even surface and good for wheelchair users/"
5857,"No carpark - parking is difficult on the street (permit holders only, mostly). There is an accessible parking space on the forecourt that needs pre booking. There are local bus services that stop further along the road. Taxis can pull onto the forecourt for drop-offs. Nearest car parks are a little way off.  "
5858,"At the reception desk the staff are always happy to help. However when you arrive at the station on the train, a rabbit does not materialise immediately and you are often left waiting for quite a while."
5859,Drove- disabled parking right outside Callendar House
5860,"Dad has certain requirements to enable him access his environment and stay comfortable and safe. Level access - he can walk a few steps otherwise uses an attendant propelled chair or a mobility scooter. Homelands has level access and downstairs accommodation and bathrooms.  They provided a wheelchair and a mobility scooter both of which suited his needs. Dad is an oxygen user - Homelands are used to this, the oxygen company delivered his oxygen compressor and oxygen cannisters to the venue prior to our arrival and collected them afterwards. Dad uses a closomat type toilet at home - there was one on site that suited his needs. Dad needs a shower seat and level access wet room - provided Dad uses a profiling bed, height adjustable with cot rails - provided with plenty of cushions.  Dad uses a riser recline chair - provided. The living area was spacious with room for the wheelchair if needed.   The outside space was accessible and afforded a beautiful view of the golf course and coast.  We were a multi generational family group and there was lots of space for us and our day visitors to join us. There was enough space that dad did not feel overwhelmed by the children who were excited and loud at times - they played upstairs in the bedrooms or on the landing which itself is a beautiful space.  We found that we had everything we needed in terms of cutlery and utensils, we did eat and prepare large family meals.  If we felt we needed a particular thing it was just a case of searching and it did turn up - e.g. oven gloves, serving bowls etc.   When we were tidying up at the end we realised that there were baby monitors in one of the wardrobes - we could have used them so will remember that next time.   The only downside for us is that the venue is situated on a coastal hill in an oldish village.  Thus the pavements are not all easy to use a mobility scooter on.  Some of the cambers and slopes are quite steep.  Dad was able to get up to the little shops area but didn't fancy the road down to the golf course as it was too steep.   We enjoyed our stay and have booked two adjoining lodges for February to celebrate dad's 80th birthday.  It is only a short drive from my parents family home, but it is far enough away to feel like we are on holiday and the venue makes it perfect for us all to get together without worrying about access.   "
5861,A seedy part of town that has come up a notch. No mention of Beatles history.
5862,"Great accessibility, good parking, excellent loos, and a place to eat."
5863,TK Maxx is located in the centre of town without a car park. There is always a distance  from a car park to access the store. The train station is also nearby. The nearest car park is the Q-Park Shambles.
5864,Various accessible toilets throughout the centre as well as a Pamis style toilet
5865,"Although this branch of Waterstones has a step-free entrance and a lift to the basement, I do not recommend it for wheelchair users because the display tables are huge and too close together, totally blocking access to the bookshelves, so that there are large areas of the bookshop totally inaccessible for wheelchair users. Disgraceful."
5866,"The park has four disabled toilets across the park. Three of the toilets are wheelchair accessible and provide aids to support the individual. The toilet near the main entrance is the most accessible for wheelchair users as it is very spacious, offering support aids, hoist and adult changing facilities.  At times this can be a potential inconvenience as it is the only available hoist within the park making it busy at times."
5867,"This shopping centre was just about 200 yards from the hotel we were staying in and found it good for buying various things, from gifts to bottles of water (a version of Spar)  It also had a good excursions centre.  In the lower floor (a massive lift to go between)  there was a cinemas (showing English films on a Tuesday), an amusement arcade and a number of eateries)"
5868,Very friendly staff who couldn't be more helpful 
5869,Great student union with further improvements due for start of term in October 2016
5870,"Every single member of staff, at both ports, were superb.  Even though we hadn't known to book a lift accessible space on board, everyone helped ensure we got one and knew what to do in future without once making us feel like we were inconveniencing them.  They were all helpful and kind and they spoke to me, not my husband about me, and none were condescending.  They made the journey easy and pleasant."
5871,"The museum has excellent level access, where as, the cottage is level access but the floor, being a very old building has cobbled stone flooring and is a bit uneven. This should not prevent anyone from visiting it! In the museum there is large print available if asked for. Some of the exhibits have an audio commentary to go along with them."
5872,"Access into the pub is easy, once inside it can be busy and then manoeuvring does need care. The bar and both restaurant areas are all on the level. "
5873,Seemed to be easy access but never actualy had to use them.
5874,My wife has been a wheelchair user for 16 years and we visited Kelham Island for their special open day. We were able to easily visit all of the exhibits and attractions and there has been dramatic improvement for wheelchair users since our first visit about 4 years ago. I was particularly impressed with the smooth wheelchair walkway which had been created to overcome the cobbled access areas.. Toilet facilities were fine and automatic doors were available. A great deal of thought and work has gone into making this museum accessible for all.
5875,"Found this venue to be COVID confident enough, we sat at tables spaced about 1 meter or so apart and the staff were friendly.  Food delicious, people even came in to pick up take aways which were handed to them at the door.  The only thing I would say is if your a wheelchair user maybe the entrance and exit which was the same might be a bit tight to get in and out.  The disabled toilet, seemed ok for someone abled bodied with hidden disabilities or not good with stairs or with a stick... and maybe a small wheel chair, the doors might seem a bit heavy for someone in a wheelchair if that makes sense with the handle a bit far up for them."
5876,"I arrived here by taxi which stopped directly outside the house.  There are lots of buses but I'm unsure how close to the house they stop. Taxis are reasonably priced in Las Palmas and I used them to get about. I would usually walk into town in the morning and get a taxi back at the end of the day and this worked well for me. The accommodation is in Vegueta (Old Town Las Palmas) and some of the streets, including the one the house is on, are on a slight slope. After leaving the house it was a five minute walk to the cathedral  but one of the streets had a very narrow pavement, which wasn't quite wide enough to walk comfortably with my crutch. However the neighbouring streets are quiet so don't be put off by it.  "
5877,There is one wheelchair accessible toilet available in the bar area it is located in the corner as you go past the bar. The light comes on automatically as you enter. There are grab rails to both sides and room for a care giver to help if required.    The Red cords were tied up however when I spoke to the manager he told me that they do untie them but find that members of the public tie them up for some reason or another.
5878,"The club is all on one level and there is one disabled toilet opposite the class studios, and one containing a disabled shower in the ladies' changing room."
5879,The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our time at the sports centre.
5880,See earlier parts of the review.  
5881,"This friendly family run hotel was an excellent base for our (I was part of a group) Tyrolean adventure.  It had been used by the company before so our Tour Manager knew it.  Although not designed for   disabled guests, all our needs were met  and the language difference wasn't a huge problem."
5882,"Had visited Harlow Carr and wanted afternoon tea. Not visited Bettys since I've been using my electric wheelchair. I'm afraid to say I couldn't get through the door, it was to narrow and there is a tight corner to it. A small pushed chair would be ok I think. Staff saw me struggling but no one came to offer assistance or an alternative entrance, other people were becoming quite annoyed that I was blocking the door, so I gave up I'm afraid!"
5883,"Access into stations is usually good with ramps although these are sometimes steep and long, but lifts are frequently breaking down so it is wise to check online before travelling."
5884,The accessible toilet in the main building is situated next to the stairs leading to the first floor. The toilet in the grounds can be found next to 'cafe tees'. 
5885,Very friendly and extremely helpful. If you can’t visit on the open weekend contact the artists/crafters/designers directly and arrange a visit direct with them. 
5886,Walkable distance in city centre. Space for taxi outside
5887,"Disabled toilets aren't situated ideally as you have to go through two swing doors to the gents, females and the disabled toilets."
5888,"Our group had a really lovely day out on the vintage trams. The staff were great, the trams were accessible and it was nice and sunny which always helps. We also enjoyed our visit to the vintage shed which is an antiques shop at Colyton station. Our group loved reminiscing with each other in the shop. Before we got back on the tram to Seaton we had tea and cake at the cafe, a really successful afternoon out!"
5889,"Clos-o-Mat loo. Wetroom was very big, very clean throughout. Adjustable shower chair / commode "
5890,Lovely nail bar with great service
5891,"We found that the majority of U L-bahn stations were accessible. So are the more modern, low level trams. Getting around was therefore easy."
5892,The Museum is accessible although there are a few parts with stairs that some people may have to miss out on. There is an awesome gift shop with a range of gifts. My favourite part of the museum was an old fashioned cobbled street with lots of old fashioned shops.
5893,"Red emergency cord had 1 bangle, was too short, and looked cut."
5894,Hotel accommodation
5895,"Loved the completely step-free entrance through a door that remained propped open (even in November!), straight down a gentle ramp right into the heart  of the venue. The space is huge and well-lit, the noise levels are quite high, especially when busy, but the environment is very relaxed. There are lots of food stalls to browse, and once you've ordered you're given a buzzer to take to your seat (or wherever you like) so you don't have to stand and wait on your food. This really helps to keep the passageway around the stalls clear from queuing and waiting crowds. I'm sure staff would be happy to assist anybody with carrying food to tables if required.   Benches at tables are lightweight and can be moved aside if wheelchair access if required. Floors were all concrete and smooth. Very dog-friendly environment - there were lots of dogs when we visited!  The bar is probably the least accessible part of the venue as the counter is at standing height and it can be difficult to attract the attention of bar staff. A dropped counter would bring this review up to five star."
5896,Should always get a parking space and entrance just beside.
5897,"I am a local in Elgin and if I ever need a taxi, I always use Ronnie's Cabs. Quick and effective service with wheelchair accessible taxis and very helpful staff."
5898,The staff are all very understanding and willing to help.
5899,"Nice, spacious restaurant at the back of the Glasshouse Hotel in Edinburgh. Good access, although bit of a maze to reach the restaurant!"
5900,"Fully accessible toilet, easily found. Enough space to get around. Loo had grab rails, was clean and tidy. Mirror was at sitting level. Might be a little tight for a carer. "
5901,"You can easily arrive by bus to the East Gate as there are buses outside the gate. Parking is available out side the West Gate, the John Hope Gateway."
5902,Both men's and women's  with rails and space to manoeuvre.
5903,The staff were particularly helpful and many thanks to the check out lady who packed my bags!
5904,"I was impressed by the access of this bar compared to some others. Though the restaurant/bar itself is up a flight of stairs, this can be reached via a lift. Once upstairs, there is plenty of room to move around though lighting was admittedly dim   "
5905,"I got a lift, but the Outlet village has public transport and free disabled parking."
5906,"Coming from the bus station, access is flat straight into Greggs. There is no door as such, as the entrance is an open space directly to the station.  However, if coming from the street (door at opposite side of shop), accessiblity could be improved.  Double doors which aren't automatic and don't have a button etc. You also cannot be seen by staff when at these doors, so would be difficult to attract their attention to get assistance.  Their is a slight step into the shop from this entrance, as floor is higher than pavement.   Inside the cafe area it is laid out with tables and chairs, these are not fixed so could be moved around. Generally main passageway areas were clear and fairly wide.  The counter does not have a lowered section. "
5907,Disabled parking bays and is on the bus route.
5908,"A step is located outside the entrance, no hand rail is provided, however the door is wide enough for wheelchair users to gain access. Outside seating is also provided in the summer months which is ideal for wheelchair and mobility scooter users."
5909,"There are marked bays near the entrance but on busy days these might all get full, however there is plenty of space . You need to pre-book the scooters by ringing 01677 427203. "
5910,"Those of us with memories of how The Astoria was before the refurbishment all agree it is now so much better. Warm. Comfy seats. But it could be so much better.  In the screens I've been to - 3 and 5 - the sound is much better. But the sound proofing is in adequate. Recently whilst watching Mary Poppins Returns there was a constant rumble from an adjoining screen showing some block buster.  Then let's talk about accessibility. Screens 3, 4 and 5 are accessible. They are not on ground level. But there is a wheelchair lift to take you down the equivalent of 10 steps. So far so good. But be warned, it is quite a walk to a disabled toilet on this lower level.  I first visited in November and refurbishment was still on going in the two upstairs screens. I assumed that to comply with accessibility requirements Reel would put in a lift to upstairs. Wrong! The two upstairs screens can only be accessed via the stairs. No good for me. (Ambulant disabled) Let alone someone in a wheelchair   I queried this when I visited. The young guy on duty was clearly embarrassed. ""I'm sorry sir. All I can suggest is you contact us beforehand and we'll let you know if the screen is accessible.""  Such a pity.   It's great that Reel cinemas have spent money on the Astoria. But its not a ""proper job"""
5911,There are two main disabled seating areas - trackside and on the terrace. Wheelchair sections halfway up the west stand are at 12a and 32a. The Terrace is half way up the West Stand and on 6 Nations days is generally reserved for injured rugby players. This is accessed by the lift in the main reception (which depending on the size of your wheelchair can be pretty tight). If you're sitting Trackside then make sure you bring suitable clothing as you may get wet! It's a great atmosphere but the view is at pitch level.
5912,"Flat easy access, automatic sliding doors.   The ordering panels are a little high for a wheelchair user, but there is a button to call for assistance."
5913,"There was an accessible toilet that had handrails and was of a decent size. However, the door did not have any locking mechanism on it and it was not a changing spaces toilet."
5914,Staff very helpful and friendly.
5915,There is a standard disabled toilet through double doors behind the bar. It does not require a radar key and has grab rails on either side of the toilet. 
5916,"There are lots of disabled parking spots, which are monitored for proper use.There are a number of buses that go to Merry Hill"
5917,"The path from car park up to the fort is steep - 1:4 in fact (we could have driven up if we had wanted and parked by the museum).  Once up there the main gate to the fort leads only to steps but there's nothing to indicate this.  In fact there is  an alternative gate however this is not signposted.  There's nothing to direct you to anyone who can assist but my husband went to the museum (who were very helpful once we made ourselves known). Even more ridiculous is the fact that access to the disabled entrance gate was up a steep grass bank and I mean steep as well as bumpy. I wouldn't attempt it again and I'm game for most things. Manual wheelchairs wouldn't stand a chance. Once inside the fort, the grassy surface is sloping and uneven in places. It's difficult to pick an appropriate route (the man who opened the gate for us helpfully suggested an approximate route)."
5918,Excellent. Almost a Changing Places toilet. There is a bench which can be lowered although I didn't see an overhead hoist. Grab rails on both sides of the toilet. Plenty of room for a wheelchair user and assistant. Very easy access to the toilet  via a wide vestibule which means there are no awkward turns. The only downside was that the red cords had been tangled around the grab rails.
5919,"There is a disabled toilet with a radar lock on it. It is a good size, with enough room for me to turn my powerchair around, and there is enough space for my carer as well. There is a grab rail.  However, I have noticed that sometimes the staff use the disabled toilet. I'm not sure why. There are able-bodied toilets downstairs."
5920,"Whether for the Theatre ( there is 3) Art exhibition (largest collection of  Lowry)  just food his is a great place to see.  A multi floor car park across the street connected to Lowry Outlet.  It would have been a five but for the sloped floor to the toilets - it is a struggle to get back up to ground floor, you could as one of the volunteers for assistance.  Discount for people with disability and carer. Good clean  Disabled Toilets on each floor.  Lifts to get to the 1st floor."
5921,"Hencote is a vineyard and restaurant built about 3 years ago . Disabled facilities are very good, decent toilets, level access.    The outdoor area(which is now closed for winter months) has accessible areas at the upper level but not to the lower ones. "
5922,"The disabled toilets are fully accessible and spacious for a large chair and carer support. Lower level basins, and toilet plinth, grab rails easier access dispensers and fully covid compliant."
5923,The venue is fully accessible – step free access and the lift to the upper level.
5924,Staff were lovely.  The head housekeep was great and had the concentrator and O2 bottles ready in my room on arrival.  Everyone was cheery and chatty.
5925,"We met the owner, Felicity, and she was most welcoming and helpful."
5926,"Disabled fans enter the ground by gates in each corner of the stadium. The stewards are quick to open it and let you in. You come out at the edge of the pitch and there is a small rise to the disabled seating area behind the goal. It appears that this is the same at both ends of the ground. According to the website 'level playing field' there are 48 wheelchair spaces at the ground, which means the Macron Stadium is 116 spaces short of the legal level. The view is good - well it would be if your team scored in front of you! You will also get wet if it rains, which is quite likely in Lancashire so be prepared for all possible weather."
5927,There are large doors and hallways providing a spacious pathway for those who are disabled or require a little more support or room.
5928,This is a small motorway service station on the M74 North bound carriage way that offers the normal services you expect from fuel to food etc. There are two areas to the service station one for cars the other is used by lorries and coaches etc.  This venue is also used as a drop of point for some of the coach firms.
5929,"All very helpful, especially in the restaurant."
5930,"Staff were very helpful and pleasant, "
5931,The bank is in a pedestrianised street so close proximity parking might be challenging. There are plenty of bus services passing nearby but they are a wee bit distant.
5932,"The toilet is situated in the bar/lounge area, there is good signage to find the loo and staff were happy show us where to go. The toilet is a good size however it may not be suitable for those in larger power chairs for manoeuvring about. There are grab rails available although there is no drop down rail  next to the toilet which may pose a problem for some. Upon speaking with the manager he took my concern seriously and is going to bring that to the attention of the owners who will hopefully be able to amend that."
5933,"There was an accessible loo in the corridor adjacent to the Spanish Hall. It was clean, spacious and fit for purpose."
5934,There is an accessible cubicle within the main toilets.
5935,"Cineworld staff are extremely helpful, more than happy to provide assistance when requested.  If food and drink are purchased staff will carry it to your seats."
5936,The security and bar staff were all lovely and made sure I was comfortable throughout the night.
5937,"Nice clear approach to the toilets, but of course a push pad operated door into the corridor where the toilets are would be better. Not the clearest signage either. "
5938,Small local history museum telling the history of Sidmouth from Jurassic times through to present times. Admission is free. 
5939,Fairly uneven paving and very cobbly in parts but area in front of Abbey smoother. Dropped kerbs added.
5940,The majority of the staff were not natural English speakers but had excellent command of the language.   Impressive co-ordination and organisational skills from the reception staff to the restaurant staff.
5941,"We were given our menus promptly, and the waitress took our order as soon as she saw we were ready.  There are only two German beers on the menu, so I chose Erdinger. It came in a lovely tall glass,  great for handling if you could handle it!  We had a metal straw which my carer lost grip of after my first gulp, and it went down to the bottom and was almost lost forever until she had to go through the frothy top to pick it out!  There was absolutely no problem in asking for a more practical vessel for a disabled person.  "
5942,Push chair up gentle slope. Doors held open by helpful staff.
5943,"There is just one sign posted disabled toilet on the  ground floor next to the gentleman's toilet. It is very busy with queues all day which can make access to the toilet itself very difficult. However, I asked a member of staff and they kindly took me through the Sir Hugh Casson cafe to the Keepers House which has a separate small lift which gave me access to a second disabled toilet on the lower ground floor with no queue. I have been to the RA of Art on at least 6 occasions and you just have to be prepared to queue or take my advice and visit the toilet in the Keepers House just 2 mins away"
5944,"Very similar Market to George Street, though has no funfair rides and is smaller. In a horseshoe layout, this appeared to be as accessible and less congested than the Square. There was more width for powechair Access. There was an undercover area with a bar and seating, the only issue, although ramped a carpeted area made up of  sections taped down, the ruffling of the carpet a trip hazard potentially. The food and drink on offer was particularly European in culture and preparation, the smells and the scents made it more interesting than a themed German Market. On sale were pottery, ceramics, pottery, picture and framed arts, jewellery, lighting and craft items. I did not see temp toilets p, but would assume the disabled and accessible toilets in the nearby Centre were immediately available. They are accessible by Radar Key, and there was a Euan’s Guide red cord info card in evidence. In the centre of the City within 5 minutes or less from Glasgow  Queen Street, Central Stations and the underground, ample bus services, and car parking ."
5945,"We stayed at the Kingsmills hotel for 2 nights for a special birthday. The room was well adapted for a wheelchair user, with a wet room and wide doorways. All areas were on the same level, including the lounge and private rooms booked for dinner. Food was good and staff were all friendly and helpful."
5946,The restaurant has an accessible entrance via a small ramp.  The ramp has quite a tight  turning circle at the top before you turn in the door. There is also a small Drainage channel at the bottom of the ramp which can make a bit of a bump as you roll On and off it. What is inside there is a large reception area which leads to a lift which takes you up to the restaurant. The lift  is quite small Bookbag enough to fit a standard power chair And one other person at a squeeze. The lift also takes you up to The hotel rooms. I know that the hotel has a wet floor shower room and Within a bedroom as you will see from their listing on Euan’s Guide. It is best to gonna head to book a table in advance. And also discuss any assistance or mobility impairment you can also do this via email. When you come down the ramp at the entrance you turn onto a narrow pavement which borders  a busy Main road I was advised having someone walk beside you is there is quite a cumber on the pavement which can be quite disconcerting. As you turn the corner onto the pavement there is a small pothole which is difficult to avoid.
5947,Fantastic concert but we did not have the best seats for a man who has mobility restrictions.
5948,No special acessible toilets available.
5949,Toilet easy to find at the top near the cafe but is quite small. There was minimal hand rails and no emergency cord.
5950,There is park outside the cinema around the corner with lots of disabled spaces. Ok if you're on a scooter or wheelchair but a long walk if you're using sticks.
5951,There are toilets but no accessible ones within the restaurant. Visitors can use the shopping centres accessible toilets but they are some distance away.
5952,Good size for power chair left transfer on to toilet. Only problem is doors one to get in to toilet corridor the other directly behin to get in to disabled toilet so can cause issues.
5953,"Access is very good with lifts to both platforms and an underground tunnel to take you from one side of the station to the other for the different platforms.  The station uses the RNIB React service to provide audio description to visually impaired visitors.  Signage was good, clear and easy to follow."
5954,I went by train into Birmingham Newstreet station Network railway assistants are some of the best for getting me on and off the train. I came out of station and then got tram from right outside station and this takes you straight to Jewelery Quarter and its about two minutes away from station. There are lifts to street level I am sorry do not know about car parking.
5955,Good sloping entrance
5956,"Step free access into the restaurant, all level flooring, and staff willing to help with any requirements. "
5957,There are disabled car parking spaces which are free. 
5958,"I don't know about parking, but Southwark Station (Jubilee Line) is a few yards away and is fully step-free."
5959,Two sets of double doors which both need to be opened for wheelchair access but staff quick to do so.
5960,On level 
5961,"Toilets are accessible in all areas of the hotel, however a number of the doors are very heavy and a number of people could struggle with this when trying to gain access."
5962,Great toilet but no red cord
5963,Approaching the store I wasn't too sure if the heavy doors we're going to be that easy to manage as a powerchair user. My fears were soon alleviated as a concierge stepped forward and held the doors open to make getting in easier. After some quick directions he showed me to the lift and explained the way out was forward as it was a double exit lift. He pressed the buttons for me and my exploration began. Getting around the departments was easy with level access and plenty of space to wheel around. On making a purchase I found the counter a little high but the card machine was moveable.
5964,"Easy access to the store, however, there are times when there is so much promotional products outside that people end up tripping over you in your wheelchair."
5965,Level access throughout ground floor and out onto patio.
5966,"A nice open pub. It has a dining area, a lounge and the front bar. Pub food served by friendly staff. There is different seating throughout the pub so there will be something to suit everyone. They show the football on a large screen in the lounge or TVs throughout. Front bar has large windows so is very light."
5967,Free blue badge parking is the closest parking to the entrance however it's still a short way.
5968,I've been here a couple of times and staff are always very helpful. When I have been on my own at the counter they have seen my crutch and immediately offered to carry my tray of food to my table. Service is always friendly and welcoming.
5969,Plenty of level parking space
5970,Easy to access disabled toilet
5971,The staff are friendly enough but other than having interactions at the food kiosks I didn’t really have any interactions with anyone else. They don’t help you with your orders at the kiosks in the way of I had to try to get my drink bottle refilled and try to reach it from them. 
5972,The staff are very friendly and always happy to cater for customers needs.
5973,There was a toilet will contrasting grab rails. Toilet was left sided transfer. There was also a shower with seating and grab rails but no changing table. These were located on 1st floor so you have to use lift to access them by wheelchair.  If needed there is a changing places toilet located in the Intu centre which the gym is connected too.  There is an emergency help point on the wall between the accessible toilet and shower. There is also a lower water fountain. 
5974,There are car parks on the Fairfield side entrance and Store Street. These are through barriers and the former involves multiple speed bumps and 2 awkward turns which can cause problems for people with physical disabilities. There is accessible parking but it is not especially near to the station at either side and at Fairfield is often blocked by private hire vehicles dropping off people without disabilities by parking across 2 spaces. Taxi drivers also make the crossing point from the station to the Fairfield car park difficult. Both car parks cost unless you're there less than 20 mins.
5975,We had high hopes of the National Nature Reserve as the literature talked of an accessible trail. Unfortunately for us the journey from the Youth Hostel car park down to the underpass that took you to the start was too challenging as a wheelchair user. I think it was a case of some maintenance is required to event out the tree roots that have grown up through the path and some work on the broken drainage challenge that impeded progress.
5976,Some on street parking. Buses travel close by and would be easily used.
5977,"Yes, the commercially run cafe (Asher’s) is on the ground-floor, but no way is it easily-accessible, either for wheelchair users or people like me who are visually-impaired. It is merely on the ground floor. And the food isn't exactly top-notch either. Try Cafe Rendevous at the Hight Street end of Church Street (about 400 metres away) if you want a taste of proper Inverness scran  The accessible toilet, which is shared with the baby-changing room, is just before the pay barrier for the non-accessible loos, but is not exactly state-of-the-art. And the change machines never work.  The signage in respect of asking for assistance at stances 1 - 3 is pointless if the traveller is sight-impaired. Very rarely a despatcher at stance.  If you are hoping to board the 919 service from Inverness - Fort William, give yourself a break and avoid the 14.05 as it never runs on time, always has a driver change and shares Stance 2 with 2 other services vying for position. You'll be lucky to leave 15 minutes late. "
5978,"We got here from Edinburgh Waverly on the train, which took us 36minutes and a 2 minute walk from the Station to the venue. Disabled parking is available at the front of venue. "
5979,We parked further along the promenade. There are loads of spaces nearby including Blue Badge spaces. It gets fairly busy so you might have to drive round for a while!
5980,"There is a large sign outside that clearly indicates where the restaurant is. However, the entrance is down a passage way so is easily missed/walked past if you don't already know where it is located. The entrance is flat meaning that an individual who uses a wheelchair could access Yates. There is various seating areas inside but to access certain areas there are a few steps with no ramp alternative, meaning your choice of seating is restricted. Yates is not table service therefore you have to go to the bar to order your food which may cause some difficulties for wheelchair uses due to the height of the bar. Unsure of alternative menus as our group where able to read the ones provided. "
5981,Very helpfully and eager to help
5982,"Visited here after a recommendation and wasn't disappointed, staff were friendly and couldn't do more for you, excellent food, fresh and hot and a wide selection on the menu.  Very safe environment regarding COVID and overall a very clear establishment highly recommended "
5983,Easy to find identify and ask so helpful
5984,You can park at the foot of the hill. A signpost takes you from the village's Main Street and along a track. The grass either side and the rough surface leaves you wondering if this is the right way to be going. Getting to the end of the track you turn in to a spacious rough gravelled car park where a reassuring sign announces the story of Boath Doocot.
5985,To many chairs and tables the tables were also to high
5986,Friendly and attentive! Very helpful getting me set up with the Tramper.
5987,All loos are accessible. There are also separate wet rooms with loos so plenty available.
5988,"I was impressed by the venue itself, but the attitude of the staff was incredible. The minute I arrived they highlighted the accessible toilet and assisted with my sports wheelchair. They also have me some tips on where to get food locally and the best way to get their in a wheelchair. They really went above and beyond!"
5989,Accessible parking on National Park Car Park (charges apply). Accessible by bus from Keswick.
5990,"I was meeting a friend for lunch. I got a taxi there from the station.  All in all, I would recommend this venue."
5991,"A ramp is available for main front entrance but if you wish to use the spa or treatment rooms, then drive down to the large car park at bottom of drive. The entrance into spa is over to you left, and on the level, until you get inside and by the corridor entry to spa and pool, where you will find steps, so not an ideal spa for disabled use."
5992,"Staff are generally helpful, both at the box office and front of house."
5993,"Someone else has already mentioned that there is no dropped kerb. There still isn't but it isn't a big kerb and with my Freewheel, I got up it without help. It is a busy road though and I appreciated having hubby with me to help decide when it was safe to cross.   The top section of the path is quite steep and has a loose gravel surface. I was okay going down but huby had to help push back up as my wheels kept skidding under me. The rest of the path was good quality - concrete. There is a fence on the side where the drop is, which looks good quality but allows someone at wheelchair height to still see the view.   The last section has steep steps and so isn't at all accessible but I felt that the view was fine from the top of those steps.  Strange access issue, I know... but I can't be the only one with both a phobia and serious allergy to nettles... the path is wide enough to get through without getting stung but they aren't exactly cut back and at the beginning of July were a lot taller than me! If it had been windy, I'd have probably not dared go through. "
5994,"As a ferry terminal, this place appears to work fine, although a bit more signage about where to put your car and how to buy a ferry ticket wouldn't go amiss. Not much sign of the accessible loo that CalMac are promising on Euan's Guide, though."
5995,Helpful staff - they moved a chair for me so I could get my wheelchair up to a table
5996,Parking at door.
5997,We travelled by car and there are definitely enough disabled parking spaces which are nearer the park entrance for easier access. The nearest bus stop is a small distance away but there will be a small walk from the bus stop to the park.
5998,"The nature reserve is situated just past Brusnwick village approximately 6 miles outside of Newcastle city. It is part of the Northumberland wildlife trust (NWT). There are two hides and a viewing area but these are kept locked and accessible only by joining the NWT, which costs £30 a year plus £10 for a key. There is a car park which is free, and entrance to the reserve is also free. You can reach the reserve from Newcastle city on the no 45 bus from the Haymarket bus station, getting off near Sandy lane which apparently brings you to within 450ft of Sandy lane - the reserve is down a road, one field long.  So as the reserve is split in two - part free and part for NWT members I will keep those two areas in separate paragraphs - firstly the free area.  There is a map in the car park showing routes. There are a couple of routes you can take to look around, one goes down to the lake and is fairly accessible in a wheelchair or mobility scooter, although it is a rough path and bumpy. The easiest path is down to the lake, which is fairly short ( a few hundred ft)., this path loops around to met the other path, but I found that the section after the first bridge is difficult terrain - too hard to navigate on my scooter so I turned back and tried the other path.  The next path was partially through a small amount of woodlands,  on a muddy, uneven path which led to a board walk - again requiring a step up, which I managed to get my scooter up, but Im sure this would be difficult for most in wheelchairs or on scooters.   I managed to get to another bridge and needed assistance on the other side of the bridge where the path goes partially around the lake - I would not recommend this part for anyone in a wheelchair or on a mobility scooter, its just far too rough and uneven. Personally I would only recommend this to wheelchair and scooter users going down to the lake, which is only a very short trip, but its the only area I feel is safely navigated, however after heavy rain, mud could make this unsafe. I would definitely recommend taking someone who can assist in case of getting stuck. It is a nice lake, fairly picturesque, although we saw very little wildlife, the woodlands are nice too. If all you are wanting is to get out for half an hour to an hour and be surrounded by nature then it could be a good option. There are no toilet facilities or cafe.  For the NWT access you need to backtrack up the road until you find the first field on the right, take this path to the end of the woods then to the end of the field, there is a right turn taking down the side of a field into woodlands. The path after the road and along the two fields is rough and bumpy, it drained the power in my scooter rapidly and was very uncomfortable despite being flat, but it was doable - just. Surprisingly this is apparently listed as wheelchair accessible! It was hard work on a scooter and I have no doubt that it would be hard work on a power or manual wheelchair, in muddy weather I would suggest avoiding it, and again I would only attempt it again if I have a strong, able bodied assistant. At the end of these two paths though there is a board walk which provides easy access along to the dipping pond and main bird hide. The hide is locked, but we purchased a key along with our membership to the NWT, it is accessible by a short ramp and is easy to get into for both wheelchairs and scooters. Inside there is plenty of room and they even have some spaces where a wheelchair user can pull their chair up to the viewing areas without having to get onto the benches. There are views into a large bird feeding area on one side and over the reeds and lake on the other side. There are comfortable cushions on the benches too. As usual in hides there are no toilet facilities. There is another hide apparently just off the boardwalk, also locked, which I did not manage to visit this time, but I was told it was along rough track but not far. I will check this out another time."
5999,"Pankhurst House where the event was held had excellent disabled access. There were automatic entrance doors and reception staff were available to quickly and easily give me access through the automatic gate into the main building. The event took place in a lecture room on the ground floor, with step free access and a ramp to the stage area. The event had a BSL interpreter and there was captions. After the event there was lift access to an upper floor room where a drinks reception was held. There was a choice of drinks and snack available. There was some seating."
6000,There was some accessibility to ground floors. There was no access through the front with a mobility scooter but a brilliant member of staff called Fiona helped us up a path that took us to the back of the garden and inside.
6001,Gaynor and Julie are great
6002,"This is a small train station between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Stirling. I found this station particularly good for signage and information about accessibility as there were large information boards listing station facilities, including hearing loops. The trickiest feature of this station I found was parking."
6003,"The staff are friendly and welcoming, and are very accustomed to dealing with disabled people. This includes the occasion on which the lift was out of order; entry was diverted through the café, where security staff could see anyone disabled and provide them with access to the security lift. I was not made to feel as if I were an inconvenience to them, despite the lengthy efforts they had to go to."
6004,There is a car park next to the venue I use my blue badge and i could to park close to the front door .
6005,"This nightclub has 5 floors and each 1 is accessible by a lift. You need a key card to use the lift which you can get from the bouncers. This is the only slightly annoying thing about the lift is that when you want to use it you have to go and find one of the bouncers to get the card. They are not always around.  On the ground floor is the bar area with some tables and chairs scattered around. Each floor can get very busy on weekend nights. So it can be a bit tricky navigating around people without running their feet over.  Each floor has different type of music. This ranges from cheesy 60s/70s/80s tunes, to hip-hop and drum and bass.  The bouncers are friendly and helpful."
6006,toilets were a decent size and reasonably close
6007,"There are a few blue badge parking bays on the promenade. At this time of year, there wasn’t the problem of them all being taken."
6008,Accessible toilet to Part M standard.  Baby change too.
6009,"The accessible loo in the South tower was great; in fact one of the nicest I've seen for space, cleanliness and usability."
6010,There are 2 sets of double automatic doors with push buttons at the entrance. When we arrived the doors didn't open. When we left the outer door was already open and the button worked for the other door. The access is step free and the public are only permitted onto the ground floor. After the entrance there is a reception desk with a partial lower counter. Next to it is RADA Bar. The counter is at standing height. There is free standing tables and chairs. It was busy when we visited and in our group was a wheelchair user and as the tables and chairs are close to each other it looked like it would require a bit of manoeuvring. However a couple on one of the outer tables spotted us and moved to another table for us (thank you). 
6011,There is a small carpark very nearby but I was able to be dropped off on the yard. It’s a road for access and there’s a large concrete area for being on the yard. 
6012,"Great location with outside seating, friendly helpful staff. Wheelchair accessible,  Dog friendly.  Fantastic scones."
6013,"Although a porta cabin style building the accessible toilet was fantastic. So much space you could have held a party! Easy to get to, on the level, wide dooorway, and grab rails."
6014,Car park was close to the museum and easy to find.
6015,My review has improved. 
6016,"Most spectators are coming via train. Gleneagles is the nearest station and if you require it there is accessible transport between the station and the event. Gleneagles Station has recently undergone refurbishment and is now more accessible. If coming by car, there is dedicated parking for Blue Badge holders - it is a fair distance away from the event so there are accessible buses to get you there. If you have specific mobility requirements contact the event organisers as there are limited spaces available in Car Park 2 which is much nearer."
6017,There's just a slight sill to get the wheelchair over at the main door.
6018,"I was really disappointed with the standards of access at this site.  Yes, it's an historic building on a steep site so access wasn't going to be perfect, but the disappointment was that the staff clearly thought their access was great.  But it's not.  Disabled spaces are at the front of the entrance,  but the surface was gravel or cobbles.  You progress through the two buildings via a series of ramps which are too steep for modern standards and in several places they turn corners across a slope.    I'm a reasonably fit user of an energy efficient lightweight wheelchair.  I seldom need assistance in normal conditions - I've even managed stretched of the Royal Mile unaided.  But I needed help several times at New Lanark, which was a problem since I went with my son.  Coming down the ramps was almost as bad - blisters on my thumbs from trying to keep in control.  I wouldn't have been much more confident being pushed by someone inexperienced.   On exiting the building the only way back to the car was up a steep roadway with traffic passing in both directions.    Access to the school house was down a very steep roadway.    Suitable for someone very confident in pushing a wheelchair, as long as the occupant wasn't too heavy.  "
6019,Nearby parking
6020,Access good into hotel lifts are good size bit of a wiggle with wheelchair getting into the room didn't use wheelchair in bar or restaurant too busy so I used walking stick
6021,"I was in the stalls. There is a flight of stairs with handrails to get there or alternatively there was a lift. I was told to take the lift to the second floor and then I found I had to walk down a few steps to the foyer of the stalls.   The foyer is where a bar is, which is at standing height and sells drinks and some cake. There is limited bench seating here.   From the foyer the stalls are step free on a gentle slope down towards the stage. I sat in row B and had an excellent view of the stage. There is a central, straight aisle but stall seats can also be reached from the end of each row although these aisles are narrower and follow the shape of the seating rows."
6022,Nothing on site but public on-street but a number of blue badge parking on roads outside. Park & Ride available for the town. Accessible local buses. Check www.stratford.gov.uk 
6023,"Only 1 table that will accommodate a wheelchair, and it's a maze to get to it. Very small table, too."
6024,I contacted the venue before my visit to check accessibility to my seats. (I knew I could get into the venue.) I was told by the member of staff I spoke to ut was level access to my seat. In fact I would have needed to negotiate about 12 steps.
6025,Didn't use parking facilities so can't comment.
6026,Fine.
6027,Disabled loo is present but basic. No changing place or additional support available. It’s a basic facility that could do with a clean. There are hand rails and an alarm cord should the user face any difficulty. 
6028,"A step-free entrance to the shop, and the aisles are very narrow indeed. Once you've committed to going down an aisle you have to keep going or back out - don't even think about turning round. Some parts of the shop are too tight to get a wheelchair through, but if you take detours you can get to every display shelf. Half a star lost for these tight difficulties."
6029,Despite the difficult circumstances of the lift failure the staff were very helpful and enthusiastic.
6030,You can park on the high street right beside the Ice Cream Parlour.
6031,there is disabled bays opposite the enterance.
6032,"This is a fascinating Palace, but it is for the most part very inaccessible. Steep spiral stone staircases, dim passageways, ruined halls and dark cellars are the main characteristic of Linlithgow Palace. However, as other reviewers have said, the Peel walkways are very nice, and you can also easily enter the courtyard of the Palace where the beautiful water fountain is, and most of the visitor interpretation boards detailing the history of the site."
6033,Brilliant.
6034,"Large car park, fairly flat and plenty of accessible bays"
6035,"A good accessible toilet is immediately of the cafe area. Bright, light and fit for purpose. The approach to the door was better than expected as there is a clear path running from the door and along to the serving area."
6036,Public transport is limited.  Disabled parking available but I've noticed that they have put a garden centre on the ones closest to the door since I last went. The bays are also really old and the markings are wearing off. 
6037,"I'd been wanting to visit The Devil's Porridge Museum for quite some time and the visit there did not disappoint. I would recommend it to anyone visiting the area. The building is modern and has good disabled access. The history of the area told in the museum is very interesting and it has a great mix of artefacts, information panels, film and audio to help bring the history to life."
6038,You wouldn't think the gardens would be accessible but there was step free access throughout & friendly staff. We went for the Botanics at Night event which made it all the more special - definitely worth a visit!
6039,"Can't comment on the parking. Plenty of buses stop nearby in Leith Street and York Place, and the cafe is near the York Place tram terminus."
6040,"The front entrance on West Nile St has steps only.  You can also enter from the other side, with a door also on Renfield St. This has flat access, the doorway would be fine for most manual chairs, but may be narrow for power wheelchairs. Could also be tricky for some people to open the door."
6041,"The visitor centre from car park with free disabled parking is simple, they allow you to take free mobility scooter from inside visitor centre to car if someone can do that for you. Doors are wide and electric there is a disabled toilet just round corner from customer service. Staff really helpful. The Scooter can get round moor with no problems even through mud and puddles. Its a must visit if you are interested in uk history and has information spots round the moor. Also has guided tour."
6042,"All staff very helpful and attentive, assisting with meals carrying tea  and food for me .  They offered me help at all times."
6043,I did not really come across many staff on my visit. But the staff in New Look are located over the store and seem happy to help.
6044,There was a lot of disabled parking spaces but we decided to go around the back of the beefeater and park beside the premier inn hotel and enter via the premier inn and enter via the back of the beefeater. Excellent car parking. 
6045,"The settings were lovely and peaceful, the lodge it's self had everything that was needed for people with disabilities, we had a varied range of needs due to the number of people going. At no point was this an issue and everything was put in place for us. The welcome was wonderful we were shown round and were given plenty of information about the surrounding areas. I would highly recommend this place for anyone that has a disability or who care for someone with a disability "
6046,Accessible pub/restaurant with a huge range of beers and an interesting menu. Just check the lift's working before you turn up.
6047,"The cinema is located on an island surrounded by busy roads. To get to the cinema you have to use an underpass. There are several entrances to the underpass and it is not clear which ones have ramps and which ones have steps only until you get to it. There is no step free route information on their website and it meant that I had to double back on myself a couple of times. I found this needlessly stressful as the cinema could have included the information on their website.  Once I arrived at the cinema access was very good. There were automatic entry doors and there was a lift to the auditorium. The doors to the auditorium were both single and double heavy fire doors. As this is not the main entry point to the auditorium there was no one about to provide assistance with opening the doors. The lift goes to the 4th floor. Following the signs for the auditorium, it brings you out at Row P which is the only level entry, step free row of seating. There is also another row behind but there are a couple of steps to access this. Looking down there is steep tiered seating, which would necessitate walking up/ down stairs. The side stairs have a hand rail on one side and the centre aisle has handle bars rather than continuous handrail. Once I finally got into my seat the view of the screen was impressive."
6048,"There is a toilet as I was aware that other people went to use it. However I don't know if the toilet was accessible. However there are a couple of accessible public toilets, which require a radar key within a couple of minutes walk."
6049,Plenty of on street parking.
6050,"There are bus stops on the Royal Mile outside the museum, but if you plan on driving there are no spaces immediately nearby. The street outside is busy. There's a taxi rank on the Royal Mile and on North Bridge."
6051,The staff at the entrance gate let our taxi through. At the palace there was a person on the ticket desk. I didn't see any staff while walking round the house.
6052,Parked our wheelchair Accessible vehicle out side the front door of the bungalow.
6053,Wheelchair access will depend on your chair in my opinion as in areas it is very narrow and dark as well. 
6054,A wheelchair accessible shopping centre that has great facilities including lifts and specialist toilets. However the toilets must be accessed using a key or by contacting a member of staff or on the ground lower floor in line with the carpark there is an intercom. This is not convenient in an emergency.
6055,There is a wheelchair accessible toilet however the signage for this is not very good. The toilet is located to your left as you exit the  ticket barrier on the upper level.  Station staff can point you in the right direction for this toilet
6056,Good food and good access with a radar key shared with baby change toilet
6057,The capability staff always have a warm welcome.
6058,Good access member of staff came and took us to the changing places changing room then came back to assist us to the pool
6059,Large accessible toilets in ladies and gents.  Two doors to enter which require help if both are closed.  Very clean.
6060,Loved this place! Great to see and hear about the Household Cavalry throughout the ages and best bits definitely trying uniform on and seeing the horses in their actual real stables.
6061,"Some newer trails are quite rough, but trails to farm, café/playpark & riverside all smooth enough. If you go down to the river & turn left following the riverbank there is a great pool for dogs to swim in!"
6062,The  venue is very wheelchair friendly  and has easy access  to the high raised wheelchair area  with a great view with a ramp to the viewing area.
6063,Front entrance (box office here) has one small step up. Ok if you're pushed but could be an issue if you're unaccompanied - no ramp was offered.   I was accompanied round the back (had to go outside again) to a side door which led up a gentle ramp straight into the dress circle. My seat was the first on the front row. My wheelchair was stowed in sight just a metre or so away. Easy!
6064,The toilet space was just about manageable but the red cord stops short of the ground. (card attached now)
6065,Plenty on–street parking available on and around Constitution Street.
6066,Step free access from street and lifts inside. Some toilets which were accessible weren't signposted as such (such as one on third floor).
6067,"There is a gently sloping ramp into the cafe and the doors are propped open. Tables are close together but the furniture is movable which makes things a little easier. It's table service, so you shouldn't need to worry about heading up to the counter.We were able to see most of the refrigerated food and pastries from our table."
6068,"Lots of spaces, but these are unmonitored and open to abuse."
6069,"There are toilets in several areas but the main accessible toilets, the largest, are in the dedicated toilet block adjacent to the entrance paths. The toilets include the accessible toilet, spacious, clean and well laid out."
6070,"Having something of a passion for the story telling around Scotland's whisky heritage I thought it was time to revisit an old favourite nestling under the shadow of Edinburgh's mighty castle.  Impressed the first time I visited, this time around and given all the covid precautions, it still enchanted, delighted and ""blew my socks off"" to wheel into the magical Claive Vidiz Whisky Collection."
6071,"Very friendly and super helpful. A member of staff is at the front of the restaurant and takes you to your seat, there are plenty of other staff to make sure you have an enjoyable meal and your table is given lots of attention."
6072,There was great access. The entrance nearest to the car park was flat. It had double doors which easily opened. It is flat throughout It is a bit tight to get through in places but you can manage if you are careful. The other entrances appeared to have a very small step in. With a little bit of help you'd get a wheelchair over them fairly easily.
6073,"The staff were great, very helpful. "
6074,"Main access to all of the separate buildings is very good. Wide areas inside the exhibition spaces and in the restaurant and cafe. A few exhibits are accessible only via a couple of steps and the Sunderland Flying Boat interior can only be viewed from atop a flight of steps. Also, some of the doorways in the Battle of Britain exhibition are very narrow - a relatively small fold-up wheelchair just managed to get through but a larger wheelchair or mobility scooter would not be able to."
6075,"We used public transport to get there.  There is a bus stop fairly nearby which goes to the place where we were staying. When we left, the staff told us which direction to go and which bus to catch. London buses, as usual, were fully accessible. I do not know of any tube stations nearby, and I would not advocate driving there."
6076,Public(radar key) disabled toilet right next to the car park. The toilet is kept ok but is a little run down. The Rumblin' Tum doesn't have a disabled toilet. 
6077,Friendly and helpful staff.
6078,Wheelchair accessible. 
6079,As I mentioned above the toilet is also a changing room / shower room with seating and rails. There is also a red cord next to the shower although this doesn’t reach to the floor yet. Inside this room there are also two low down accessible lockers which are very spacious. I have taken pictures and written captions which you can view. I dropped a half star as there was not a red cord next to the toilet which I think is a big safety issue.
6080,Easy to get in through power operated doors. Accessible toilet. Tables and chairs moveable.
6081,"Excellent accommodation. !  Lovely spacious rooms ,well and tastefully furnished , very well equipped with overhead tracking in bedroom and bathroom , In a beautiful setting overlooking the golf course and links.Staff were very helpful . Thoroughly recommend"
6082,"Mixture of good and bad experience. Staff in check in fantastic and helpful, airline allowed me to take my own wheelchair right to the door of the plane , and placed my fold away walking frame in the hold. New designated assistance area, more visible, with someone in attendance, seating looked very low, .disabled toilet in check in area has been upgraded, but actually  the old one was more accessible . Access to toilet very narrow.  Very Steep ramp once through security.despite advising I could not manage steps, ambulift was not place flush with entrance to plane, and was a good 6 inches short, assistant stated that was as close as they could get, but when stewardess advise them to get the lift on chair, they were able to position it much closer! Same ambulift used at Stornoway airport and was flush with the entrance. Had a similar problem on way back. Airport parking, disabled  parking difficult to find and has been moved further away "
6083,"Staff were full of suggestions and very helpful, and made the visit really good. "
6084,"We arrived from the Banbury area, and main A422, and you pass this delightful hotel as you enter Wroxton village, but you need to drive round the bend to find its car park. The entrance itself gives you a feeling that all is going to be well.  You can be dropped off by foyer entrance while driver parks up, or park yourself before making your way into hotel. However, the car park area is on a stoney and rough area, we found it hard work to get across to foyer, so lower marks given at this time for parking. If it happens to be raining on your visit you may not be very pleased about that by the time you get into hotel, as we found no disabled area provided near the foyer. But please do not let that spoil this delightful little hotel visit for you, stick it out and you will really enjoy your visit."
6085,"The website has no mention of accessibility so we rang to ensure it was suitable for a wheelchair user and they confirmed that it was. When we arrived I was a little daunted as it’s a very old but beautiful building that was formally a bank and had been converted into a restaurant but kept all the features such as the old wood panelling and stained glass windows. The daunting bit was a very steep set of stone stairs leading into the restaurant. We could see no sign for disabled access. One of our party went inside to enquire about disabled access and we were told to “go round the back” and someone would meet us. This was a little confusing as there were a couple of doors we passed but as there was no one there we continued around until we found a gated yard which was clearly a shared access to several buildings including the back entrance to the restaurant. The gate was opened by a staff member who let us in and showed us to the back entrance. If I had been alone, meeting others in the restaurant then I would have been unable to access it and would either have had to ask a passer by to go into the restaurant to ask for help, phone the restaurant from outside to get in or call whoever I was meeting for help, hoping they had got there before me. When we got into the restaurant someone had parked their large mobility scooter in an area that would allow access straight to our table but it simply meant that I had to go around the edge of the restaurant and through the bar area to get to where my party was sitting. Inside there were several tables in an enclosed area in the centre of the room which could have been alittle awkward to negotiate in a wheelchair but we were seated on a table around the outside which  was absolutely fine for access. We had a real issue when we left as there was no staff member available to assist us we had to get out on our own and the gate had a magnet release a couple of meters before the gate itself and we had an issue with the fact that the gate was so heavy that it took us a couple of tries and in the end a passerby helped my mother and I get out of the yard. "
6086,"We came by train from Partick station, which is about 10 minutes walk but a nice walk. If you arrive by car, there is a drop-off point. I don't know about disabled parking. The 100 bus stops very close by."
6087,"We drove, parking was fine, I walked to the gift shop to pick up the scooter."
6088,"It's a Wagamma, you know what you are getting. Greate Asian food. Great value"
6089,There is a step free entrance to the small gardens. There are pathways through the garden but be careful as some tree and bush branches are over hanging in places. There are plenty of benches. 
6090,"Wide door to let you in, easy clean floor area, all chairs will cope well here. It had grab rails and pull cord. Thank you very much to management for thinking about disabled people."
6091,Disabled parking spaces available but not clearly signed 
6092,"If travelling by car, large area of carpark with disabled parking bays. Seemed good layout with room around each parking bay.  Although it was busy for the event when we were there, there were staff directing the traffic as it arrived/left. This was well organised, it did take a bit of time for everyone to get out, but seemed to go smoothly.  I don't know about public transport to here."
6093,Ramped gateway entrance from side lane is a little narrow but manageable.
6094,On a main road with no obvious parking and heavy traffic: travelled there on foot with wheelchair. No knowledge of public transport but certainly a number of buses going passed.
6095,"See photo. Not 100 % standard but spacious. Right support rail is a little further away than standard and the seat is permanently raised. Soap is a pump dispenser. Baby changing in all toilets but not marked on the door so parents were taking up the accessible toilet. Emergency cord does not reach the floor and does not have handles. Good floor grip, slightly wet. No hoist or changing bench."
6096,"Along the drive towards Bodenham Arboretum it takes in at times, narrow countryside lanes, but at a steady pace, it’s no trouble at all. At the entrance for the parking to see the Wyre Forest, along a busy main road, take it nice and steady, or you will pass the pull in areas, and there isn’t that many places to stop.  A bit more of a problem at the Safari park, if you do drive into the lanes towards the kiosks, as there isn’t a way you can then get out without going through the kiosks, so  make your mind up before hand if you intend to visit the Safari park."
6097,"Approaching the main entrance a push pad triggers the wide automated doors. Once inside a clear floor graphic offers a welcome and directs visitors up the stairs or via the access route. The access route is clearly signpost and leads you to a large lift which has room to turn a powerchair in. The buttons are clearly labelled so you know where to head for. A brilliant addition is a doorbell push button on the first door so that you can call for assistance if you need a hand - the labelling clearly explains this in a way that is welcoming and encouraging. Once in the main space there is plenty of room to move around with loads of seating, computer access, a cafe and a recreation with dropped counter."
6098,Brilliant! The entrance to the Forth Floor is just around the corner from the main entrance in Multrees Walk. When you enter the lifts are right in front of you to take you to the restaurant. It's a roll in and roll out the other side lift which is useful. When you get to the restaurant it's spacious and easy to find your table.
6099,"Although we didn't need to park, everything was explained in the information"
6100,"No steps, sliding glass door. Tearrace doors in the house all allow you to wheel straight out so would be great in summer."
6101,"There were slopes on the walkway to the Hotel but signage was good - and once in the Hotel, the main obstacle were the thick carpets.  The lifts were a good size too and the interior well signposted."
6102,Helpful and friendly staff.
6103,"We brought a group of older people with learning disabilities to a matinee performance of the Ice Show. Prior to our visit we arranged to carry out a risk assessment of the venue and the member of staff who showed us around was extremely helpful. On the day of our visit the staff made our group very welcome, they took orders for ice creams and delivered them to our seats during the interval. All the staff were friendly and helpful and this contributed to the success of our visit. Thank you."
6104,The access is so good you don't even think about it.  Highlights for us were: Wide doorways and corridors.   Openplan sitting room with lots of space. Our cottage had 2 bedrooms downstairs with ceiling hoists.  HUGE wetroom/shower-room with hoist. We brought our own shower chair.  Profiling beds in the bedrooms. Peaceful terrace
6105,"There are three doors into the main centre all automatic and powered by push-pads/ touch sensors on the right hand side coming in. A beep will go off when it has been activated to let you know the doors opening. Two doors in the accessible toilet is on the left hand side, then another door will take you into the centre."
6106,there are accessible loos on all floors. so easy to find.  I get in with my power chair + carer.  With 5 accessible loos in the building I  can find the best one for me to use. 
6107,"Used Handicabs for transport needs Nearest train station is North Berwick, which is about 10 minutes by taxi, which needs to be pre-booked (no taxi rank) You need to make your own way there  "
6108,"We drove, there was ample parking on the day with a number of disabled spaces. I think it could get busy as the parking is shared with hospice visitors. A table can be booked at the cafe if needed. "
6109,There is a bus route and a few parking spaces
6110,"Good access, great food. Nice lunch spot."
6111,"This review is for the Mary Quant exhibition which has just opened and is on until 16 February 2020. The exhibition covers the 1950s to 1970s, lots of clothing including mini skirts and hot pants, Quant's own make up brand and accessories. The entire exhibition is step free."
6112,"If you plan to eat, book a table online before your visit, it’s always busy! I love a visit to the Hard Rock Cafe whichever city I am in: decent food, lovely staff and good music.   The Glasgow venue does not disappoint. Go round to the left of the building to find the accessible entrance and use the lift to get to the bar and seating area. The store is also accessed via the lift if you want to look at merchandise. Otherwise, sit back and relax!"
6113,"Parking is on the street, and the parking strip is ramped, usually no spaces available on this busy road."
6114,"The Anchor does have a disabled toilet however, it isn’t very spacious if someone needs assistance from someone else. There is no changing place toilet though. Down at the beach in Broughty Ferry there is a changing place although, it is only open till 5pm in the Summer and 3:30pm in the Winter."
6115,"Plenty of on street parking available and free for blue badge holders. However, none available when I visited so I parked in Buchanan Galleries which is a 5 minute walk away.   With it being right in the city centre lots of public transport available. Queens Street railway station is across the other side of George Square. "
6116,"As the name suggests the venue is out in the countryside, we travelled by car, as only 30 minutes away. Plenty of car parking , with large designated disabled spaces near the door. Path to door even and flat"
6117,Generally pretty good although not as helpful as at Dobbies Dalgety Bay or Livingston. The pianist in the café at lunchtime was amazing! Don't know if he's always there or if this was just a special occasion. 
6118,"for a shopping centre, it is one of the best that I have visited. The shops arealso generally fullyaccessible as all the restaurants. There is even a spa which I believe is accessible also. We public areas are kept very clean and hazard free."
6119,Level access to venue.
6120,There are a significant number of disabled parking spaces behind most buildings at Port Solent. The problem is then relying on the 2 lifts to be in working order for you to change levels in order to access the main boardwalk area.  The closest parking spaces to the two lifts are located firstly outside the Odeon Cinema and secondly behind Casa Brazil and David Lloyd Gym. 
6121,"The venue is located 100 metres from the main town bus station, with traffic free and level access from the bus station through to the front door.   The Eastgate car park, with fully accessible disabled parking bays located just 50 metres from the theatre.  On-street free disabled parking 80 metres, 130 metres and 175 metres from the venue. Drop-down kerbs at all points to cross the road. "
6122,Easy to find. Very good instructions supplied.
6123,Good bus connections.  No disabled bays nearby.  Two unrestricted spaces just along from the front entrance.  Can park on double lines on street to the rear - no waiting restrictions but one of the residents isn't happy about that.
6124,"The main entrance has two automatic doors which operate with a push-pad system. On one occasion this was broken, however staff at the nearby reception desk were on hand to help keep the door open. There are two lifts, one each side of the main linking corridor that allow wheelchair users to access the upper floors of the main gallery. All rooms have step free access, and any elevated platforms come complete with ramps. The majority of the exhibits are easy to navigate. There is a single lift at the back onto Argyle street, accessible via push pad doors, with a walkway onto the street level."
6125,Wheelchair accessible but the staff are so rude.
6126,It is ramped up to the entrance. There is automatic doors.
6127,"Plenty of parking spaces, three of them are disabled.  No public transport runs up to the distillery, the nearest bus stop is 1/2 mile away."
6128,"The staff member who saw us parking and helped us in through the restaurant, carrying a bag to our room, deserves special mention. Also the staff member who seated us for breakfast - he made sure we had a table that suited my needs and checked whether I wanted to transfer or not."
6129,Parking outside on the street but no disabled parking at the actual venue that I was aware of but there is a lowered kerb and it was easy to park.  There is also a car park nearby.
6130,Big wide uncluttered toilet with appropriate grab rails; bit of an awkward door arrangement to get in and out without banging main restaurant
6131,"I've put the review date as October 2018 but to be honest, we go on a regular basis (at least once or twice a month)  We love this place! Its family friendly and has an excellent choice of food and desserts.  The layout is brilliant, there are tables, booths and even an American school bus that has been decked out inside with tables to give a different kind of dining experience (not wheelchair accessible although it can be accessed with crutches if you can manage the bus steps)   We tend to sit in the 'gas station' part of the diner which is just for over 13 year olds and upwards. It tends to be quieter in there because of the lack of little people!  There is seating outside with a play park and also a large indoor play barn too (can't comment on this as we've never used it) They are also very seasonal and deck out the place at Halloween and Christmas etc and it looks great!  Like I said, its a usual haunt of ours and we will keep going back again and again! "
6132,"Access into the store is really good with a wide entrance and level access. The store has an accessible loo, trolleys adapted for wheelchair users, and induction loops."
6133,"The doors into the museum are electric, the whole area is wide and flat, with lifts to other floors. There is plenty of space everywhere."
6134,"The Boardwalk is wheelchair accessible, I have a big power chair and it was no problem for that. There is also a special surface on the Boardwalk  to prevent those people who are walking from slipping. There are Braille signs around the Boardwalk, there are also tapping edges and lots of resting places.  It is well maintained too."
6135,It seems odd at first awarding five stars to what I originally perceived to be a potentially difficult terrain of but it made so much sense when our tour guide spent time and effort in planning a route for us that provided level access all the way; just a couple of dropped kerbs. We had two powerchair users in our group and there were no problems at all in getting around. We saw everything that was described and were able to get up close to things. Our colleague who has a visually impairment loved the picture book that the guide used to show illustrations of things.
6136,"We drove and there is ample parking ,even for guests."
6137,great access
6138,Staff vary from outlet to outlet but are mostly friendly. My wife left me in the car to go toilet but forget to put up our blue badges. Someone came around checking the disabled parking spaces. I was about to explain but he told me not to worry as he could see the wheelchair in boot.
6139,The ship does have an accessible toilet but not having used it I can't comment further.
6140,Level access from the street and a lift to the required floors.  Hearing assistance.
6141,"A wheelchair accessible Christian community church situated within the Meadowhead area of Sheffield. The community church is conveniently located within a small shopping precinct and all members of the public are very welcome. Every Tuesday morning a food bank is run from the community church and coincides with the church's coffee morning and Citizen's Advice Bureau drop in clinic. The food bank offers support to those in crisis and in order to access the food bank service you must have a formal referral into the service. Visit www.gracefoodbanksheffield.org.uk, or contact the referral helpline on 07580 516 512 for more information. In the afternoon on a Tuesday a cooking class takes place, which involves the community cooking a nutritional meal together and then eating it in each other’s company.  All volunteers are very welcoming and will spend time chatting to you over a cup of tea/coffee."
6142,3 free parking spaces outside venue also free parking at rear of shops. Bus stop at Johnstone Square 2 minutes walk from Papamacs.   Train station 10 minutes walk.
6143,"The Delaunay Counter is a café in the style of a Viennese Coffee House, located on The Aldwych, serving  savoury food but their speciality is their Austrian cakes, such as apple strudel, Black Forest gateau and sachertorte (chocolate cake).  It's got good disabled access as it's steps free, has a disabled accessible toilet and helpful staff."
6144,Very welcoming and friendly. Drinks order taken promptly and waitress came for the food order as soon as they saw we had read the menu and were ready. Staff were very attentive but not 'in your face'. 
6145,All the staff are approachable and willing to help. The museum offers to make any special arrangements if possible if they are contacted prior to visiting
6146,Staff very helpful. Especially the cafe staff who were exceptional. 
6147,"Very helpful, met us with the ramp, no problems at all."
6148,"Went for lunch.  Although on top floor, there are lifts.  Fantastic food, amazing views, excellent service.   I’ll be back!!"
6149,Caffè Nero at Eldon Square is just near one of the entrances to the shopping centre. There is level access into the shopping centre and also into the shop. I went on Disabled Access Day and claimed my complementary coffee.
6150,"The staff were helpful, patient and friendly. They made the effort to make conversation throughout our visit."
6151,"There is a ramp leading into the airport where you are met with Braille directions and automatic doors. Immediately inside the arrivals area, there are toilets including a large accessible loo - but be aware you might need to move through a bit of a crowd to reach them. At the departures lounge, disabled access was much more obvious. There was an electronic accessibility information podium to give you directions, disabled access information and useful tips. I spotted it immediately. The airport was entirely level access throughout, and everything was clearly signposted. The food outlets are very hectic however - so be prepared for scattered queues and bustling about at tills and collection points."
6152,"Staff were fabulous! Really loved the guided tour and tales of whisky making ... The cafe staff were attentive and happy to tweak the furniture to get my powerchair chair at a table of my choice. The team in the shop were great and happy to take time to help with purchase and explain the nuances of the many, many whiskies. "
6153,"Here to see Glasgow Rocks play basketball so have my foam finger at the ready! The venue is accessed via an elevator on the outside which takes you to the next level up and the viewing platform. Once in the arena, there’s a huge amount of accessible seating!"
6154,One of the best ever!
6155,The parking was very very good we could  park outside the hotel and take my stuff out the car
6156,"Disabled parking next to first building - park shop - so very convenient; however, doesn't have parking bays so cars can park close to each other which may make it difficult for some people to exit the car or get a wheelchair up to the car if someone has parked too close."
6157,We parked about 2 minutes away from the ground. I also noticed there were 2 disabled car parking spaces opposite the ground. The nearest bus stop is about 5 minutes away from the ground at James Square.
6158,"It's a flat surface, it's got 4 lifts and one lot of stairs. Every shop entrance is accessible. They also have lifts inside the shops. Accessible from the car park. Partly sheltered."
6159,"All very helpful but not over the top. No ""does he take sugar"" events thankfully!"
6160,"A traditional seaside pier with shops, cafes and amusements. there are nice views of Eastbourne sea front. Fun place to spend time."
6161,"The Changing place toilet was near the entrance and spacious , well equipped with grab rails."
6162,Average  felt awkward on being asked if needed assisting if there was a fire
6163,Cinema located in The Forge shopping centre which you enter up a ramped entrance with some disabled seating areas located at the back of the room.
6164,Staff were very friendly and helpful. 
6165,did not visit
6166,Level access throughout and security staff helped me with doors without even asking
6167,"Great day out with my husband, mum and father-in-law.  I got in for free and they gave me a fantastic  Access Guide which clearly showed what was accessible and what wasn't . There was an inclined lift to get down to the lower town . Lots of costumed staff around if you have any questions. Loved the old fashioned fairground, Only reason that it's not a 5 is that we bought sandwiches in the cafe then found they were 2 days out of date"
6168,"Level access, automatic doors, ramps and slopes."
6169,"Pleasantly surprised that the most disabled friendly facility in our trip to Aviemore turned out to be 3,500ft up the Cairngorm! The funicular is thoroughly recommended for able bodied and wheel chair users as a great day out.   Fantastic exhibition, great cafes, stunning views, and highly accessible facility."
6170,"A wheelchair accessible route all around the park.  Staff were around (if you need assistance go to No 3 Cottage where they are based, though they are often out in the grounds).  Disabled toilet available also"
6171,There is ramp access into the church. The door was wide open. The church is small with benches on either side. There is a central aisle leading to the altar.
6172,Parking is close to the entrance. But you need your own transport or get a taxi.
6173,Level access throughout. Wooden floors so easy to move around. Wide corridors in shop.
6174,Staff were outstanding the disability staff training is second to none!
6175,"There was a wooden ramp from the parking bay up to the private patio area. The patio had table and chairs, gas BBQ, patio heater and small outdoor fridge, but there was still space to easily move around in my wheelchair.  Access from the patio into the tent was level and step-free. Once inside I was shocked by how spacious it was. There was lots of space to manoeuvre around and it felt bigger than a lot of hotels I've stayed in. It also felt nice to drive across the smooth wooden floors.   The king-size bed was comfortable and was nicely decorated with cushions, blanket and hot water bottles. The bed was lower than a standard bed, so it made wheelchair transfers fairly easy. Space underneath the bed could accommodate a portable hoist if needed.  As there was no electricity in the tent, there were times we struggled especially in the bathroom at night. The small solar light on the roof didn't give off much light so we were almost in complete darkness. This made using the bathroom even with assistance very difficult and a little risky especially as I can't walk, have extremely poor upper body strength and rely on help with everything. I feel the low-key lighting is perhaps not so good for guests with mobility and visual impairments.  There are so many pros to there being no electricity. One being you get to switch off and have no distractions from the internet world, friends etc. However, this could be a problem for disabled guests who require mobility aids/medical equipment and also need to charge them. I have a powerchair so I'd need to charge it if I was there any longer than a day. Thankfully I live very close and fully charged my chair the night before our stay. "
6176,The church has its own car park with 3 accessible bays right by the door (a lot of spaces as it is a fairly small car park) car park is flat and smooth surface  Close to a bus route - couple of minutes away
6177,"The front door has a very tall, steep and slippery hump. It is extremely difficult and annoying trying to get a wheelchair or powerchair over this hump, and in wet weather impossible, because it's shiny, and slippery when wet.  The doorbell button is much too high up on the doorframe and almost impossible for most wheelchair-users to use.  Worse still, the reception staff cannot hear the doorbell because it's located in some remote part of the building at the back, so I am often left waiting outside in the cold, or I have to bang on the door - because it's not possible to even attempt to get inside without someone holding the door open.  Once you're inside, it's all fine, there's room to manoeuvre and even with my chunky powerchair I can get into all the examination and treatment rooms."
6178,"Peterborough Station provides full step-free access and extremely friendly assistance, there are modern (2013) lifts to all platforms. The station is about 10 minutes walk/roll from the Cathedral. Be careful - the route is very badly signposted and you may get temporarily very lost."
6179,I visited the apartments not too sure what to expect. I found them to be very good for me as a visually impaired person.
6180,We went by car so cant comment on public transport.  Plenty of disabled spaces near the front door
6181,Good  ICT access to all floors.
6182,The staff were very friendly and obliging in assisting us and showing us around their tearoom. 
6183,The lady at the ticket box for the lift was helpful in telling me about the access to the roof top. The staff at the museum entrance just issued me with a ticket and didn't provide any assistance/ advice.
6184,Friendly and accomodating
6185,"This is the first time we have been stayed in a property that is adapted for the needs of the disabled.  it was wonderful for my wife to be able to have a shower whist on holiday, and for her to be able to move around freely in her wheelchair when ever she wanted. The home made scones went down a treat when we arrived, thank you.  The welcome pack and the info on the website, along with the personal recommendations from Helen made it easy for us to plan our stay."
6186,A nice spacious place to eat with polite service
6187,Steve was very helpfully thoughtout our stay
6188,Welcomed to the premises. Very friendly. We were given a table and the chair was taken away to  accomadate my wheelchair . Meal was ordered and everything arrived promptly arrived and was delicious. Great  service and even had decaf tea.
6189,"The disabled toilet is a good size and you need a Radar key for it, which prevents it from being abused and helps to keep it in a good state of cleanliness.  That though is the only good thing I can say about it.  It's location is not convenient for a wheelchair user, being that it is right at the back of the auditorium about eighty feet or so from the disabled area. Not so bad if you have a catheter but if you don't and you need to go, you are going to have to fight your way through eighty feet of wall to wall bodies. And you know what it's like, most able bodied folk can't see below chest height and are oblivious to wheelchairs......ooh, all those ankles and feet for the taking!"
6190,Crown Glass Plaza has disabled parking in its car parks. The nearest is the Council owned parking approximately away near Waitrose on Link Rd. The nearest train station is Nailsea & Backwell which does not have disabled access.
6191,"A Wheelchair friendly Contemporary Café & Bar that honours the best in local produce and independent suppliers where possible, with a selection of homemade soup, sandwiches, salad and breakfast. Ideally situated in town centre "
6192,"Exceptionally helpful, especially the concierge team. In advance of our arrival they arranged hire of mobility equipment. Staff were keen to help throughout our stay."
6193,This is a very accessible venue. The entrance has button controlled automatic doors. There is a very spacious lift to access all floors of the building. They also have Welcome by Neatebox installed so that you can make staff aware of your access requirements in advance of your arrival. 
6194,good clean accessible toilets
6195,The toilet had a lot of space and some of the changing areas were equipped with hoists to support individuals.
6196,A regular place for us to go for lunch or coffee in the cafe and a stroll around the gardens.
6197,"There are two main entrances - one to the Chocolate Lounge and exhibition, and one to the Chocolatier's Shop. Both are level access entrances, and although the doors aren't automatic, they are lightweight. The whole Chocolate Lounge is level access with low seating, movable furniture and plenty of space between tables and chairs. It is quite dimly lit throughout however. As you enter there is a viewing window to where the chocolate is made and a wide archway into the lounge where a friendly member of staff greets you. If you want to then go on through to the shop, there is a short flight of stairs with a wheelchair lift - however if you would prefer not to us this lift, you can exit the Chocolate Lounge entrance and follow the path (at a gentle gradient) around to the second entrance which has level access into the shop."
6198,"The macrobert arts centre is very accessible to people with disabilities. All the spaces are wheelchair accessible. Even backstage and getting on to the stage is accessible. You can go on the stage via a locked door which goes through to backstage, you can go through the prompt side door to get on stage or you can go on stage via a stage door beside the auditorium. The macrobert has relaxed screenings for people with hypersensitivity and autism. They also have an 18+ drama group for people with disabilities and additional support needs."
6199,Wheelchair access excellent - all on the level with wide access doors and well spaced seating in the cafe. Good space to navigate the farm shop. No high shelves and staff happy to assist both in the shop and cafe. N.B Outdoor play areas not included in this review and the outdoor areas are hilly. There are picnic tables and a viewing area which would be suitable for wheelchair users or people using other mobility aids but we didn’t’ use them on this visit. 
6200,"A dedicated Post Office with space to get in, move around and access the counter."
6201,"Great little restaurant in Balmedie. Good food, nice staff and lovely atmosphere. It doesn't look much from the outside, but is actually very nice. I didn't see a sign for an accessible loo on the way out forever - so didn't get a chance to ask if there was one. "
6202,"There are 2 platforms for viewing the races, there is no access to anything other than ground floor bar and charity coffee shop as there are no lifts. You can easily view the pre race paddock.......there is very little signage throughout the racecourse."
6203,Very helpful and willing to discuss needs.
6204,"The disabled facilities were clearly outlined in the brochure and included information about wheelchairs, hearing assistance, toilets, parking, assistance dogs, ear defenders, an easy read guide to visiting the festival, an easy read guide to the programme, additional needs badges and volunteer escorts.  Their brochure was also available in large print, braille, audio CD and MP3 format.  They provided details of how to contact them should help with access be required.  We used these contact details for help with our parking problems and this help was indeed provided.  The large cafe was accessible for our wheelchair users and we were able to pull tables together so that we could all sit together and watch all the activity. The food available would not necessarily have been ideal for our people with disabilities but we had brought their own food with us anyway."
6205,Amazing access from the moment you leave the car.
6206,"Level access into the pub, plenty of seating and a disabled toilet."
6207,Hard to find your way around. Signposting not helpful to visually impaired people. Barriers hard to use. Difficult to find somewhere to sit and wait for train.
6208,Quite a large car park and ramp to door but completely packed with cars close together and on kerbs - possibly being used by attendees to the SECC complex for Take That concert night
6209,Full wet room and wide access
6210,Staff seemed friendly and helpful and very used to dealing with tourists!
6211,"Really nice modern quirky pub, roomy enough to move easily around in a wheelchair. Accessible loo altho you need to get a code from bar staff. Excellent Sunday roast!"
6212,Very pleasant and knowledgeable
6213,"The ferry was very accessible for the wheelchair, actually much more so than I expected. We had an accessible cabin which was more than adequate for our overnight crossing from Aberdeen to Lerwick on Shetland. We also took the car across with us and that was very well organised and seemed a well drilled process. "
6214,Only used the toilet in our room but did notice disabled toilets at reception.
6215,Corfu Town is a short 5 – 10 minutes’ drive by taxi from Corfu Airport. There are buses that serve the town centre and taxis are plentiful and quite reasonably priced. Plenty of local buses stop close by. I took a taxi from my hotel.
6216,the staff at the GESH are great with people with a disability as they have ran them for many of years the Disabiled Clubs
6217,The main entrance brings you in via the take away ice cream counter. This then has stairs to the main restaurant. However round the side of the building there is a ramp to another door which has a bell on it to summon assistance. Inside the restaurant the layout is flexible and chairs can be moved around to suit your requirements.
6218,"This is really a yes and no. There is a ramp into the visitor centre and onto the castle grounds. However, access into the castle itself is blocked by a 10 cm high step, which could quite easily be retrofitted with an on and off ramp to give access to the castle court. Big plus for Historic Scotland though - they provide an access guide for their properties: http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/access-guide.pdf"
6219,Very spacious toilets and very clean.
6220,"The toilets are in the Sailing Club clubhouse, 15 metres from the cabin. The clubhouse was rebuilt a few years ago and so the toilets are modern and fully accessible, spacious with room for a carer. They are very clean. If needed a volunteer can lead you to the toilets."
6221,"Such attention to detail was shown by all staff we met - and so helpful but not at all intrusive. After my 1st night, I mentioned that there was no reading light in my bedroom - I had an excellent contemporary lamp the following evening!"
6222,There's a car park with blue badge spaces outside the hostel and landscape discovery centre (which share the same eco-friendly building). We also saw modern local buses stopping there several times a day. 
6223,The staff on reception were really helpful and gave lots of information on parking and accessibility
6224,The whole experience is great. You make yourself visible at the bus stop and then the driver deploys the ramp in the middle door so you come right in where you need to be. One manoeuvre to settle yourself in and you're underway. 
6225,It is mainly staffed by volunteers who were really nice and talkative once they realised I wasn't intending to steal the plants!  They had a great pride about their garden and wanted to share it.
6226,"The Colosseum was one of the highlights of my trip! We went as early as possible and this worked really well to avoid the busy June crowds. Access was surprisingly good, and in places it was even excellent. At some points there was a bit of rough terrain, but not everywhere."
6227,"No parking needed as we arrived on public transport. The metro lift is at the bottom on the entrance ramp to the front door of MICs, and another lift is directly across the road which you come up coming from La Rambla. There is also a bus stop outside but we didn’t use that. It is worth looking at the T10, T30, T50, or T70 travel cards they are exactly as they say in trips. Depending on how much you are going to travel. We stayed within zone 1 but that is a big area and we done 48 trips for the week. They work on the metro, buses, trams and trains all very wheelchair friendly (another review on Barcelona)."
6228,"The Hotel has a small car parking area for four vehicles. There is a single dedicated accessible parking bay. The bay has clear markings and provision has been made for sufficient space for a wheelchair user to be able to move alongside their vehicle to transfer. The parking space should be booked at the time of making the room reservation.  For those using public transport the street side options, only a few metres from the hotel’s front door, offer buses, tour buses and taxis or slightly further afield the tram network and of course the railway stations at Edinburgh Waverly and Haymarket."
6229,Level access cobbled st level toilets 
6230,"Blue badge spot directly outside, buses with disabled access on the Cowley Road. Reasonably accessible."
6231,The access is surprisingly good as a wheelchair user. You can wheel across the flat grassland area quite easily and get some spectacular views out to sea and over the village and the busy harbour. A slabbed pathway takes you to the visitor centre which is accessible. You can also walk beyond the centre and on to the grassland of the headland. It is a bit lumpy in places but with care you can get some great views out to sea and along the coast. More ambulant visitors can climb the steps and go up to the viewing point about the visitor centre.
6232,"I had no trouble with access, a nice wide door and plenty of room on the inside."
6233,"Reception staff Not exactly polite or helpful, could have opened door near reception to help get in but just watched struggle.  Podiatry nurse was brilliant though"
6234,Great - there is parking right outside the front door.
6235,staff were always respectful when individuals needed time to communicate  what they were trying to order or if someone needed a last minute change of what they wanted to eat or drink and I didn't feel pressure to order quickly or awkward when something needed 
6236,Typical old building you will need to get the attention of staff inside to hold the doors open. No steps. Level access from pavement . Bistro tables are not far from the entrance but staff will take you to your table.
6237,"Portaloo, only 1 disabled toilet there."
6238,The nearest tram links are just opposite the train station. Tram stops and platforms have recently been modified to ensure disabled access is provided at the majority of stops on each line. Access the city-map online and check-out parking locations: https://www.gis-mannheim.de/mannheim/#  Deutsche Bahn also have a dedicated webpage and contact numbers for people who may require assistance: https://www.bahn.de/p/view/service/barrierefrei/barrierefreies_reisen_handicap.shtml
6239,Paved path round to side of hotel so no steps.
6240,"The Botanic Garden is a beautiful and peaceful spot in the heart of the city of Cambridge, 3/4 of a mile from the city centre. Set in 40 acres of grounds, with wide paths and good access throughout, it's a lovely place for a day out all year round. It's almost entirely wheelchair-accessible, including the excellent cafe. Free entry is available for a companion/carer/PA if required."
6241,Parking is a short distance from the main meeting point at the Tourist Information Office.
6242,Last time we stayed the concierge were fantastic. This time they were very unhelpful. The Duty Manager was very dismissive of our concerns - he could not have cared less. We felt like second class citizens. It was very upsetting and frustrating. 
6243,"Parking city centre is not easy, on street parking is available but there's a walk to the venue from where you can leave your car. Bus transport is good and stops are close to the location. "
6244,The main restaurant area is quite spacious the main doors in the restaurant are quite heavy and difficult to open without assistance 
6245,"The train station is about a 10 minute walk away, and it's on a slight slope down from the station to the sea front. There are also a number of buses that run along La Croisette or stop nearby.  Sorry unable to comment about car parking, but assume it would be expensive given the location."
6246,Out of order sign on door but it had been used for storage. They quickly cleared it so I could use it. Disabled  toilet quite shabby compared to rest of the restaurant. 
6247,Parking is not brilliant being at the top end of the Royal Mile ( a fairly steep hill).
6248,"We found all staff very welcoming and friendly, polite as to our needs, and willing to support us with what we were allowed to see and do."
6249,"Our lovely guide have gone the extra mile and researched, in advance, the accessible areas of the tour. It was such a delight to spend the morning with Laura, our guide, and sad we had to say our goodbyes."
6250,"Yes there was a lift, which is poorly sign posted, there is little seating available to rest, the stairs now have candles along the banister, which is unsafe.  The lounge area and sun longue are out of bounds due to the clutter of furniture in the longue, it was difficult to impossible to use, or sit safely and definitely not wheelchair friendly, a complete nightmare for me and I can walk, but with balance and special awareness problems."
6251,Excellent access and they are keen to help
6252,"excellent, helpful"
6253,"Virtually no parking immediately outside as it is on the high street. Some street parking is available, but I didn't see any disabled parking on the street. There are a few public car parks nearby with excellent disabled spaces. "
6254,"A small step into the cafe, the owner said he would consider provision of a ramp if required. Plenty space inside, tables and chairs would be moved needed. The toilet, very clean, small but well serviced and provisioned, not wheelchair suited."
6255,Motel One is a modern hotel situated a short distance from Waverley Railway Station. It offers a range of rooms and has a lounge bar area that doubles as the dining and breakfast area.
6256,"The access throughout the Hotel in my wheelchair is very good. Including to the Spa, Gym, Bar and all restaurants. There is a lift up to the rooms which is a good size. The vast majority of the Gardens are also accessible as is the gift shop whic h does have a small step."
6257,"There was a slight step to get into the restaurant, however my chair cannot get up anything higher than 3cm and I just managed to get in. I did need support to get out because when I go down any bump I need someone to support my chest due to me not having upper body strength and I could fall forward. I don't know if they have a ramp for easier access as I didn't need to ask due to me being able to just get in with a running start. Could not see a sign to say beware of the step. See photo below of the step.   I felt that the tables, especially the one we were at, was quite low down and the frame of the table was rubbing the top of my knee. Therefore if I was a millimetre higher I wouldn't get under the table. I'm not sure 100% how the other tables were, although when looking around they all looked to be the same height. Also I struggled slightly to reach things on the table due to the height. Again this can be seen slightly in my picture.   All in all the restaurant was very spacious and plenty of space between tables. There is a seating area up a couple of stairs but majority of the tables are on the level access floor."
6258,"A bit hard to find at the top of the castle, through the side door to the cafe. At the visitor point they are easily accessed beside the red phone boxes. Well appointed inside. "
6259,"The greatest wheelchair adapted place that we have ever stayed in. Perfectly converted and equipped for specialist needs (profiling beds, mobile hoist, even a lazy boy chair in the lounge!), but also really nicely done and with super friendly owners. Fresh farm eggs a bonus. Dog friendly. We will definitely be back!"
6260,Disabled spaces out the front of the entrance and also plenty of on street parking.
6261,"No Changing Places. The toilet is to the right hand side of the restaurant and is accessed by a RADAr key. Be careful not to trip down the two steps which lead to the male/female bathrooms, the accessible toilet is before this area."
6262,Drive in and register your vehicle at the reception. 
6263,We got there using the tram - we got off at Edinburgh Park Central and it was just a couple of minutes away. We were asked not to be there more than 30 minutes before start time and we'd timed it well. I was surprised that the tram wasn't busier. From the tram stop it is level access to the venue and had the distinctive EIF branding marking the way.
6264,Fully wheelchair accessible throughout the site. 
6265,The staff were great. Particular thanks to the security man who helped me use the platform lift.
6266,No specific disabled bays at the forest car park area but there is normally enough space. The surface is OK but could be better.
6267,"There is no problem with accessing and moving round the venue. There is a lift to upper floor and also a ramp connecting the floors.  I mainly visited the Planetarium and the Science Theatre, both of which were wheelchair friendly. All café areas are also wheelchair accessible. There is a big area with lots of computer games and these are mainly fully accessible."
6268,The staff were helpful but it was busy so they couldn't spend much time with customers and we waited a while for our order to arrive.  Not sure whether it was understaffed or there were too many customers.  They did their best under the circumstances.
6269,"I was able to get around ok in my powerchair (I didn't go up towards the woods which they say is not very accessible). The terrain is variable with some hard surfaces, some loose shingle, fields and compact earth. The viewing of animals are variable according to the structure of the pens. E.g. The pig pens with baby pigs and their mums were high brick wall structure where you needed to be at standing height. The design probably can't be helped but visitors of a small height need to be prepared to not see all the baby pigs and chics. Numerous chicken and duck breeds with mesh viewing. The petting area rotate small animals to come out onto low hay bails to interact with. There is a small step at the end of the entrance ramp into the farm. Bird,, butterfly and creepy crawly house have heavy doors. Some inclusive play equipment."
6270,Janet and Jon were extremely helpful and interested if there was any way that they could improve the lodge for the disabled.
6271,The staff was very friendly and helpful when I  visited the hotel and were happy to answer my questions.
6272,"The entrance from the street is through open double doors of a slight incline on the pavement. You will pass the door to the Accessible Toilet on the right before another set of double doors, which swing open forward into the restaurant and bar area. The restaurant has an outside terrace which overlooks the River Tyne, but that is currently inaccessible in a wheelchair.  Many of the tables are pedestals, so it is easy to get underneath in a wheelchair as the height is about 75cm."
6273,"The loos are clean (as clean as a loo can be), and the urinals are spaced out to conform to social distancing measures. They include a changing bed for babies and young children. There is an accessible toilet in the hallway of the cinema itself. It has a red emergency cord, though it does not have a red cord card. However, there are no changing places toilets."
6274,Easy to spot + well signed disabled loo. Has grab bars and mirror and is clean but could be even larger.
6275,This is my first major day out since I've been getting of lockdown last March although I was very nervous the majority of the Abbey monument is outdoors so I feel quite safe to drive around in my wheelchair. It was a really big confidence boost for me. The pass around the abbey which itself is in ruins are all very flat and block paved so it's an ideal path for any wheelchair user. Within the abbey grounds there are some gravel pathways but they are easy enough to avoid by staying on the paved areas.
6276,"As we were staying on a half board basis at the Labranda Playa Club, it was only natural we ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel.   For those not on half board, breakfast was only  around 6.50 euros and the three course evening meal 12 euros.  If staying at the hotel, residents also got a 10% discount.  Excellent value all round. Breakfast was  self service but had all that one could require -   Fresh fruit, orange juice, yoghurts meats, cheeses and so on.  There was bacon and sausages available with eggs done to order.    The orange juice and coffees were also very nice.  A meal to set one up for the day. The evening menu was also very extensive, with a lot of choices for starter main and desert courses. I admit to being a fussy eater but during my 11 nights in the restaurant, I managed to vary my main course quite easily. I felt my wife, as a vegetarian,   did not have a lot of choices but she enjoyed what she had.  I mention this to a member of staff late on our holiday and was told if we said what was required, they would do their utmost to supply. On this, we found that staff to be friendly and show interest in their customers.  On the occasions the restaurant was busy, the staff were very efficient in ensuring orders were turned around in a reasonable time.   It was good to watch them in action and they always had a smile for you and seemed genuinely interested in what you had been doing..   Sorry, but I am really bad at remembering names but Raul and Joanna  were absolute stars. We only had a bottle of water and a pint of San Miguel with our meals which only cost 4.50 Euros."
6277,Super helpful and PRO inclusion of wheelchairs
6278,"The disabled access spaces in the car park, are no wider than the other spaces making the accessible spaces less accessible to some. "
6279,Just on the pier at Waterhead and Bowness.
6280,"I travelled by car from Dundee to Fife and was able to park my car right infront of our accommodation in a disabled blue badge space. Between everyone that was staying at Homelands with me for the weekend there were four cars, including my own. Not all parking spaces were taken when we arrived so we were able to find spaces for all cars, and I also noticed that the house next to us only had one car between everyone staying there so we were able to use cars further down the driveway. However, I feel if all houses had more than one or two cars between visitor then there might be some difficulties.  Due to not being from this area I am unsure about public transport, although there is information available on the Homeland website. There’s a bus stop 200mm from the entrance to the accommodation, list of certain buses are on the website. Markinch railway station is 8 miles away from Homelands and there are taxi services nearby, I think contact details were available in a book located in the livingroom of the house we stayed in."
6281,Plenty disabled bays right outside the door.
6282,"Only let down are the toilets, I'm not aware of any changing places toilets and the toilets are on the small side, but plentiful.  Silver chalets aren't far away from main campus to return to."
6283,"Access to the Staion is by lift at the west end and ramp at the east entrances, at the moment the whole area of the St. James Centre area is being redeveloped so the James Craig walk is closed. Well serviced by tram and bus services."
6284,Pretty limited. There's steps around square with no ramps. Have to stop in somewhere on the upper floor to have a rest. Only one lift that takes ages to become available.
6285,We used Justpark and got parking not too far. London is not great for accessible transport for me!
6286,Staff stayed behind the counter when I visited but they were happy to answer questions I had. 
6287,"Southpour don't norma!ly take bookings but did when I phoned to explain I was coming down in a wheelchair. Easy access through the main door from the street. Friendly staff on hand to help with the doors. The 'Easy Access ' toilet comes up trumps with plenty of space to get through to it. The food was superb, clearly care went into the preparation as it both looked and tasted superb. Great work Southpour, a very enjoyable visit."
6288,"Generally good, theres an access lift to get between floors and its level throughout with no steps at any of the entrance points..."
6289,Plenty of buses but I would imagine parking would be a challenge. The hotel may have allocated parking but as we weren't staying I'm afraid i don't know
6290,There is plenty of disabled parking available in the car park but no dropped kerb to access the venue itself 
6291,The museum building is in one of the buildings that former the World Famous Albert dock this of course is a very old dock and as a result there is a mixture of paved areas and cobble stoned roads and walking areas with in the docks this of course is very bumpy if you are in a wheelchair. When the cobble stones are wet because of rain then it can be very slippery. There is good signage on old fashioned St corner signpost to keep you right there is a good wide stone ramp to the door of the museum and you enter via a good wide glass door and then a second inner door. There is an information desk in the left hand corner as you enter. There is two lifts to all floors these are big and well lit and there is  green lights on the edge of the doors when they open that makes It very clear the space you have or the width of the door. There is a notice at the lift doors that informs people that wheelchairs and prams should have priority in the lifts. There is space to move around all of the floors of the museum   
6292,Disabled ramp at both entrances. Large double doors so spacious entrance and exit. Access to the tables may be difficult if the individual is in a wheelchair.
6293,"Lovely helpful staff. With five stars I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt over the red emergency cord in the toilet, but if I could be sure they were the culprits who tied the cord out of reach, I would not be awarding five stars!"
6294,"This was the house of Daniel O'Connell, an important Irish historical figure, and you watch a film about his life before visiting the rooms he and his family lived in. There was a lift inside and I got round pretty much everywhere on my small scooter, with the help of one or two alternative wheelchair entrances where there were steps to the main doorways.   We had a nice lunch at the adjoining cafe, using outside seating which was fine for me, but I don't know what the indoor seating was like because it wasn't open due to Covid.  The museum part was interesting and worth visiting, and a plus of the visit was the level grassy path from the house across the dunes to the low cliffs above the beach. The beach itself wasn't one for wheelchairs, but it was wonderful to be able to get right amongst the sandy wildflower meadows on my scooter, and the views were amazing. "
6295,"There is a very small step to get in, there are two entry  doors as there are two different levels inside which are separated by a few stairs. A staff member helped me get up the step to get in the lower level- it was smooth and easy. In my power chair I’d have climbed it easily but I was in my manual chair. I fit perfectly under the table, the tables are ideal for wheelchair users. There are bar seats and some high tables too so I’d recommend booking a table. "
6296,"Good access, couple of obstacles but nothing major"
6297,The staff were friendly and helpful. Let down slightly by the uncertainty of how to use the platform lift.
6298,The couple who were our contacts were very helpful. I did not need to contact them re access issues.
6299,Disabled parking bays are available in the main car park closest to the building. The car park operates on a first come first served basis only for all parking spaces. Blue badge holders must display their blue badges at all times whilst parked. The nearest designated bay is 100m (109yd) from the main entrance. The route from the car park to the entrance is accessible to a wheelchair user with assistance. Assistance may be required because there is / are slopes/ramps. The car park surface is tarmac. There is a dropped kerb / non stepped access from the car park to the venue.
6300,"Lowered counter at reception, level access to ground floor. lift to all floors. No automatic doors in corridors and doors are very heavy. Lots of seating in reception."
6301,"I've done a recent review so this is just an update.  The covid safety restrictions which were in place at last visit are still in place, so people are asked to pre-book as timed entry continues, wear face masks unless except, socially distance, wash their hands.   To the left of the top of the stairs/ lift at the entrance there are 4 seats with back support. I had raised it last time that the sofa with no back support was too low and I was happy/ touched that when I returned that the staff had listened to what I had said and had replaced the seating for something much more accessible. Thank you so much Wellcome.  The cafe is still spaced out and the shop is still closed.  There are 2 new temporary exhibitions Tranquillity on Level 0 and Joy on Level 1. The topics feel very timely as we all could do with peace and joy in our lives given the last 18 months we've all had.   Tranquillity is a very peaceful gallery with soothing background music. The exhibition is in 3 parts. The first My Body is a Temple of Gloom section and the third and final section Regarding Forests are dimly lit and the middle section called Balancing Act is brighter. The exhibition is spacious and well designed. We went on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't busy. It was very easy to social distance. There is seating throughout the gallery, which shows that accessible furniture can be contemporary and creative. There is one exhibition, which is a digital photo gallery and to turn the pages you wave your hand in front of the screen. We felt very mellow and chilled going through the gallery. It was nice to stop and ponder. It's definitely one of my favourites of their temporary exhibitions.   Joy is very visual. The first section depicts people dancing, the second section has a number of smaller and fun exhibits and the third and final section is called Procession of Eighteen. The gallery is again well spaced out and there is plenty of seating.  Neither of the 2 temporary were too busy and the spaced out layout means that it was easy to social distance. It was a very relaxing and stress free visit.  In between the galleries we  went to the cafe on Level 0. It was not too busy when we arrived and tables are spaced out. We both had a veggie lunch box. Really delicious and wonderful combo of textures and flavours. The food is pre-packaged but it is still freshly made and the quality is excellent. It was nice sitting there and catching up after having not seen each other since early 2020. Then we became aware that next to us a table became occupied by a group of about 8-9 people. At that point we decided to cut out visit to the cafe short and we left. I raised it with staff, see staff comments below.  We went back to the cafe later, when it was quiet for cake.  We had a really lovely and apart from the large group in the cafe, the rest of the time we both felt very safe. "
6302,Fantastic. Really helpful onboard and off. Explain how ticketing works clearly and you can hear them offering help to everyone on board for whatever reason. 
6303,All very friendly who we met.
6304,"Excellent. Wide open corridors, escalator and lift access."
6305,Good access overall - there's three different lifts you need to use between the platform & exiting station but now we know where to go we'll be using this station more.
6306,Parking available on first level of car park
6307,Level but boneshaking access to front door via ramp and duckboards with metal grip strips. See below for problems withe toilet access. Interior access fairly spacious. 
6308,Access is great! Step free access from front door to seats. We were on the accessible seating platform accessed from Door A. There was a short ramp to get to this. The platform itself has both moveable and fixed seating which made organising ourselves very easy. View from accessible seating area brilliant.
6309,"very slight lip at the door and although there was a wheelchair user in the tea room when I visited, it would prove difficult to get to the toilet or to tables further away from the door"
6310,"The staff were welcoming, friendly and very helpful. We were particularly impressed with the pre-visit information as we were nervous about visiting."
6311,"There are 2 bathrooms in Pinder cottage. Though no hand rails, a portable stand with rails both sides was available at no extra cost."
6312,"We had arranged specialist transport - a fully wheelchair accessible vehicle - with a local firm, Haller-Mobil -  http://haller-mobil.at/ - whom we would highly recommend. On the outward journey the driver was able to park very close to the entrance to the arrivals hall and deploy the ramp easily.  Dropping off on departure was more complex - it seemed a much busier part of the airport and finding a parking space was more difficult for our excellent driver."
6313,The mobility car drivers couldn’t have been more helpful. Staff in the Crown Jewels room made sure I could get close to the exhibits and asked people to move to let me get closer. Everyone made you feel very welcome.
6314,We were pleased to get a booking at the  Seven Dials Hawksmoor. We went on a Sunday afternoon. We all ordered the roast beef. The portions were massive especially the Yorkshire pudding (see photo). The beef was delicious. Seven Dials Hawksmoor is  Wheelchair accessible and has a disabled toilet. 
6315,Super kind and helpful when making sure the ramp was placed safely.
6316,Stall holders are very friendly and helpful in showing you their produce and helping you make a purchase.
6317,"Clean, well designed accessible toilets on both floors.  Changing Place facility available."
6318,"Assistant did not know that shop had a portable loop, but other assistant did, He did not know that loop had to be on the counter, nor to turn it to face customer."
6319,"Access in and around the park was good. We followed the various paths and explored around the lakes, gardens and activity areas. The Visitor Centre in the middle of the park was accessible. Finding you way was easy as there are loads of signs and a very good map that you can download from the website."
6320,"Five stars for ease of access within the main terminals - ramps and lifts whenever needed. On departure, to get to Terminal 1A we had to cross a road in the open - not a problem provided you watch out for traffic and it isn't raining.  The signage leaves quite a lot to be desired, especially on departure. The information desk in Terminal 1 was unmanned when we first stopped there, and the special assistance desk in Terminal 3 turned out to be specific to a particular airline (not ours) but we were more lucky on our second visit to the information desk, and were told to go to check-in."
6321,"Both toilets easily accessed whatever type of chair, manual or electric"
6322,"Tucked away but easy to use, a good size and clean.  The worst part is the door."
6323,"Last weekend was the fourth Electric Fields. After going last year and having a brilliant time, we couldn't wait to go back and see if the access had improved and if it would be as fun as last year.  With seeing acts like Aldus Harding, Real Estate, Anna Meredith, Foxygen,  Jesus and Mary Chain and Arab Strap we were promised a great weekend.  I am writing this review as somebody who has poorer balance and has has a speech barrier and who camped."
6324,Considering this is a brand new building felt overall accessibility was disappointing.
6325,Helpful.
6326,"It is tucked away within the Aston Webb Building of the University of Birmingham campus in Edgbaston, just a few minutes trundle from University railway station. There is limited blue badge parking on campus. Local buses stop fairly close. "
6327,Bang in the middle of ground floor  with room for the whole family
6328,My father in law and I had a fantastic day at this brilliant venue. No issues at all.
6329,Staff friendly.  Table service.
6330,"There are two parking spaces right by the church, but no reservation system - get there early. There is also on-street parking nearby, which also fills up early. There are plenty of bus stops nearby, though a slight slope on Battersea Rise to get from the bus stop to the church."
6331,"From the time of enquiring about HOMELANDS, booking the accommodation and leading up to our stay, everything went like clockwork. When we arrived a member of staff showed us to our lodge and took us round it. As there were 8 of us, the accommodation we stayed in was the largest of the self catering lodges. It exceeded all our expectations. The lodge had been expertly designed and laid out for disabled guests. The downstairs was completely adapted for wheelchair users. It consisted of 2 twin bedrooms, each having an electric profiling bed. There is a very roomy wet room. The main living area is open plan and a door opens out onto a patio. Upstairs consisted of 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. The situation is perfect with amazing views. All our family were able to join us and this was a truly happy time! The staff were very friendly and could not have been more helpful. If you happened to bring your dog with you, there is a dog bowl outside!"
6332,Limited parking on the Royal Mile.
6333,This is a review of the accessible fitness facilities available at Vikingar Largs
6334,Access is good and assistance is available.
6335,"The first part of the path was gently sloping and a bit stony, but after that it was flat boards with wire over them and passing places. Plenty of benches."
6336,Entry into @Bristol is flat through automatic doors. Lift to all floors. Designated wheelchair spaces in planetarium if given advanced notice.
6337,Our experience with the staff at the airport has always being great. The main support we get comes from the PRM team OCS and that is always first class. 
6338,Great overall access with ramped entry to buildings with accessible toilets and changing  rooms  with accessible boats with winch  to assist with  great staff who are more than happy to assist
6339,"Was a great evening out, all be it very cold. Was much much better than I was excepting. Beautiful scenes made up of giant waxed paper Lanterns. Most impressive. "
6340,London is very accessible by public transport. 
6341,"Disabled loo at former Tissington station - bit grotty but welcome!  If going to Herbert's, they have a lovely one."
6342,"Overall the venue was good. Nice and bright, which helps me as I'm visually impaired, and the staff were very supportive when it came to giving me assistance. I couldn't see any blue badge parking nearby though, although there was a drop-off right outside, and a fellow attendee who is also a wheelchair user commented that the parking was 'quite a bit away'. "
6343,"There is a mobility car if assistance is needed up the cobblestone slope. We decided to walk/roll up and I was able to manage in my powered wheelchair. There were cobblestones all around, but I just tried to go slow while driving over them to minimise the bumps.   Most of the rooms were accessible with either level access or wooden ramps. I was surprised to see a modern lift had been installed to take disabled visitors up to the Stirling Heads Gallery. There are some areas of the Castle that aren't wheelchair accessible, but The Access Gallery is great as it has displays, images and interactive games etc and it allows disabled visitors to see parts of the castle that are difficult to access for wheelchair users etc.  "
6344,"The hotel overlooks, at right angles, the north end of Playa Canteras, the city beach in Las Palmas, the capital of Gran Canaria. It's a mid price hotel, which is currently undergoing some refurbishment. The hotel offers breakfast, for an additional charge.  It has a sun terrace.  It has limited accessibility for people with mobility difficulties."
6345,Large garden centre with café and clothing etc. Plenty of room to get about (except in the Clothing / Household section which is pretty cramped for a large wheelchair to get though without pulling stuff off the rails) and helpful staff.
6346,Full marks to the staff. On arriving the reception staff explained the layout and the best routes to take. This included pointing out the accessibility of the viewing area. In the exhibition areas I met other staff who were friendly and gave tips on what to see as we went around.
6347,"Tottenham Court Road station is step-free and only a few blocks away, Green Park Station is step free and about half a mile away. Several bus routes will drop you near Cambridge Circus, which is just round the corner. "
6348,"good decent size, disabled toilet with all the other toilets at the side of the restaurant and there is a clear path down the side of the restaurant, with no tables do you entrance is not obstructed by other diners"
6349,"A handy train station in Larbert linking up Stirling with Glasgow and Edinburgh. Slower trains than the main Edinburgh to Glasgow line, but all journeys well under an hour. Good ramped access and decent parking at this station."
6350,Getting to Stirling Castle can be a bit tricky but that's more to do with the volume of visitors. If arriving by car their is a car park on the esplanade. There are several Blue Badge spaces but these do fill up quickly. There's also a regular bus service that drops people off at the esplanade. 
6351,Exhibition very interesting. You are given a ticket as one of the original passengers and have a guide to talk you through the experience . A hologram also talks you through interesting facts and figures. Long enough to be interesting but short enough that children will not be bored. Allow an hour.
6352,"Flat surfaces everywhere, good paths"
6353,"Accessible loo easy to find, clean and fresh, lovely decor Plenty of room to manoeuvre  wheelchair and turn full circle Plenty of room for a carer One drop down rail to left of toilet, I found this difficult as I need to push up with both hands to get off toilet, perhaps repositioning the adjustable rail to the right hand side of the toilet and a grab rail on the left hand wall, would provide more assistance for wheelchair users I had to move a bin & toilet brush to get to sink, but that was a minor issue. However I had to use my wet hands to turn my chair to dry my hands on the towel which was hanging on the door behind me, the towel hook could do with being a couple of inches lower for wheelchair users to use."
6354,Helpful and smiling.
6355,"Large disabled toilet, easily enough room for a wheelchair and carer. Toilet just outside auditorium on ground floor."
6356,"As we were travelling with a wheelchair, we found it very easy to get around as there weren't many steps. There were a couple of nooks and crannies that we couldn't quite access but could get right up close to see the animals and staff were so good in making sure we got a good spot for animal encounter sessions and milking demos. The only thing we couldn't access with a wheelchair was the train but the tractor was fitted with a lift and safety bars so we were very happy with a tractor ride instead of the train. I believe there is only one wheelchair spot on each tractor ride so best to mention to the staff as soon as you can."
6357,"We will say this, Scottish people seem to be naturally friendly, will people, and we received all the support we needed. Staff everywhere are just the same, so we offer high marks for our Scottish friends."
6358,"Good shows and musical on. Toilets and lifts available, good bus routes and parking."
6359,Big and spacey
6360,"Staff gave a friendly welcome at the Reception Desk. Restaurant staff are equally friendly and helpful - even carried tray to the table for us. Guide (Alan) on the Museum Tour was very respectful, entertaining and informative with some great little anecdotes - we have visited a number of times but saw new things and learnt a lot!"
6361,"We drove. No accessible parking. If you can park by reception, it's reasonably level.  Other parking is a lot further from reception, though there's plenty of it."
6362,I did not see a disabled toilet but wasn't looking for one as I used one in the center before going on board. I would surgest looking at their website or calling to get any questions answered. 
6363,"If you phone ahead to the actual theatre, you can book one of their Disabled Parking spaces in their Courtyard.  It is difficult to park outside  because it is a main road but is easier at the end of an evening show.  There is parking in side streets however."
6364,"Large room for carer, clean tidy"
6365,"Despite my other comments, we found staff helpful & friendly."
6366,"All good, no problems"
6367,We tried to eat here before a concert at Hydro we had booked a table however there is no dropped Kerb  to Access the venues ramp from the car park. We never managed to access the venue.
6368,Step up into restaurant SMALL toilet. Small portion size for the price £10 for small dish of pasta.  Bus stop near by not easy to move around inside the restaurant chairs tightly squeezed in.
6369,"The surprising thing about visiting is what you see once you are inside. The Victorian exterior of the building suggests something of mature years and then you go inside to be greeted by a modern, spacious, bright light work space."
6370,Super people - friendly and very helpful. One member of staff helped my wife to transfer from her wheelchair to a cafe seat while I went to order food and coffees.
6371,"This is a beautiful venue in the heart of Leith, which has a wonderful, varied history. In short it closed in 1988 and reopened again in its sorry but well love state in 2016.  So as you can imagine access is pity non-existent, I have visited a few times for some brilliant gigs, such as Mogwai, Joan as Policewoman and Young fathers. I have not put on a review as I know the venue is desperate for funding and once they get it I'm pretty sure accessibility will improve. "
6372,"Public transport, cab, parking limited"
6373,"Staff were helpful, helped us get in the lift and met us coming out."
6374,"Easy to access and for the upper rooms, a good sized lift is available. Excellent provision of letting disabled people in before the main crowd, but can be a long wait in the queue. Also very busy and crowded in the foyer.  Very few seats available in the foyer."
6375,This Neptune Centre is a community swimming facility which provides a state of the art 120 station gym. In addition to this it houses a library and also a cafe which can be accessed by the general public. 
6376,Two toilets at different locations. Clean and easy to reach everything.
6377,"The staff were amazing. Huge thank you to them without their support I wouldn't have had the confidence to go on holiday.  I travelled on Christmas Eve the airport was busy, there were lots of flights taking off and all the staff were so pleasant and helpful. They didn't rush me into the wheelchair and they pushed me through check in and security into a designated area for special assistance customers. I was then able to make my own way to the shopping area and just had to be back at the designated area for a given time. I was then wheeled through and taken into the plane. "
6378,"Access across carpark uneven and slightly uphill. Access into hotel flat, through 2  sets of double doors, both doors need to be opened to allow wheelchair access.Between the 2 sets of doors, there is a large depressed area containing a doormat, which is impossible to avoid, my manual wheelchair got stuck in it every time. Plenty of seating inside and out to rest. Once in main part of building all public areas bar one are on the flat. Large visible reception desk, with low level desk, another set of double doors to access bar, restaurant and conservatory.Signage good.Lift to upper floors is quite old fashioned and narrow, would probably not be suited to wheelchair use, but okay for those with some mobility. No evidence of anything to assist those with hearing or visual problems.  Lighting quite dark, which could be an issue for those with visual problems  To access to our room in the annex we had to leave the hotel down an uneven slope and along a gravel path, which I would not have managed on my own. There was a slight ledge on entering the room which was a challenge to get over as well.The room was huge, plenty of room to manoeuvre, although we had to move the bed to allow wheelchair access. It also contained 2 sofa beds.Electric points, USB points, hospitality tray, and hangers were all accessible ."
6379,"The Reading Buses number 21 claret runs from Lower Earley, through Reading University campus and into Reading town centre including the train station.  The buses are almost always wheelchair accessible with a ramp and good space for Wheelchairs and my fold up mobility scooter to get on board.  The bus drivers have always been helpful and encouraged space to be made for me and my scooter onboard."
6380,"We are and have been annual members for a few years now. It is the one place I know I can go and not worry about using a wheelchair. They have disabled parking close to the entrance and it is all level. They have disabled toilets which contain changing beds, these are accessed with a Radar key. The cafes and picnic areas are all accessible, the animals are all in lovely habitats which can be seen from our lower level whilst in a wheelchair. The staff are helpful especially in the cafe. I've even had their maintenance man come and save me when I'd made it into the zoo only to have my electric wheelchair breakdown. He tried so many different things and when he couldn't sort the problem he got me one of their manual wheelchairs so I could still enjoy a trip around the zoo. As a disabled guest I am offered a carer to enter for free with me. This means I only pay for my concession price and my carer gets in too. This is always a great help and means we can visit more often. This is the same with the disabled annual ticket, it's a helpful offer as I wouldn't be able to access the zoo on my own. This isn't because of access issues it is down to my illness. I have a friend who is also a wheelchair user and she meets us at the zoo and is able to access it all by herself from parking with a WAV to visiting the toilets. It's a lovely day out and one we enjoy frequently. "
6381,"The park is a short distance from Herne Hill Station, which offers step-free access to the platforms, and access to trains via manual boarding ramps (if you're lucky enough to find any staff to assist with ramps). The park is also about a 15-minute walk from Brixton tube station, which is fully step-free from street to train. Numerous buses serve the areas around the park. I wouldn't try parking near the park."
6382,"Different stalls staff, and different engagement from them."
6383,"There are 2 disabled parking bays just by the entrance (you go in to the golf range entrance, not to the shop).  Not sure about public transport."
6384,"The staff were expecting our arrival and were friendly and helpful throughout. One staff member showed us which doors we could use for wheelchair access (staff only doors) which was handy, and the doors simply led through to other corridors so we didn't feel like we were in back rooms or restricted areas."
6385,"only toilet is a large disabled toilet with unimpeded access and no stored items in it. Clean and tidy with grab rails and accessible wash hand basin, etc."
6386,In the St Johns Centrie shops were not made for wheel chairs to much clutter and to much stuff displayed to close for anyone to get round making it impossible for disabled people. The centre it’s self was good.
6387,"Parking is charged, even for Blue Badge Holders. There are some places you can park for free but are a short distance away and one is controlled by cameras and is for a limited time."
6388,"This museum is all about rope making, something the city of Oudewater is well known for.  In this museum you will learn about the history and process of rope making.  There is also a demonstration where you can make your own rope to take home as a souvenir.  The rope museum can be visited in under an hour."
6389,There was loads of room for manoeuvre in the toilet/showeroom. The fact that there was a wash hand basin which came down with the press of a button for my dad to b able to shave himself and see in the mirror independently was great.
6390,Do not stop rides for people with physical impairments or those unsteady on their feet.  a number of rides you have to climb in/out of.   On one ride we saw the disabled/ wheelchair sign next to a set of stairs.  We did not have a wheelchair user in our group but they would be very hard pressed to find ways to get to any rides
6391,To access the accessible toilet a person using a wheelchair would need to go through the single door to the rear of the large community room. The door width would accommodate an electric wheelchair and there is enough turning space to turn the wheelchair in the corridor so that the wheelchair is facing left. Travel down the corridor and your will notice the accessible toilet directly in front of you. The toilet is signposted and is clean and tidy. There is enough space for a carer. Key features of the disabled toilet:    •	Door opening 86cm/door opens outwards  •	Drop down rail on the right hand side of the toilet  •	Vertical/horizontal rail on the left hand side wall •	Toilet is 19 inch in height  •	Sink is 90 cm high from the floor  •	Hand dryer is 100cm high from the floor  •	Lower position mirror on the wall  •	Lever tap with thermostatic control •	Emergency pull chord in situ  •	Light switch in reaching distance
6392,"Initially my friend had gone to the cinema in person to book the tickets. She informed staff specifically that I had a disability and asked about the accessibility of the screen. She was lied to as she was informed it was accessible. When we arrived and our tickets checked the member of staff informed us where the stairs where. I asked about a lift. She informed me that the lift was out of order. I asked her how long it had been and she said about a month, but someone was there today fixing it (02/01/2020). She did not apologise and she didn't offer any support. I walked up 2 flights of stairs with handrails. They were not particularly difficult stairs but as we where in screen 2 we had to walk to the second floor and that took a lot out of my spoons.   After the film my friend (thanks to her), spoke with one of the Managers called Lucas. She explained that she had specifically came into the cinema to book the tickets because she wanted to make sure they were accessible and although she had told them that her friend was disabled at no point did they inform her that the lift was out of order. I explained how I had been treated that day and the lack of awareness staff had shown. I also suggested putting photos of the venue on their website so disabled people can access for themselves if the venue is suitable to their needs. Lucas accepted these comments and said there was an issue about staff training and he would speak to his staff today. He also offered us a complementary drink. "
6393,"Only one step onto the Terrace, lifts, ramps everywhere and staff to help who were really aware of the additional needs of wheelchair users."
6394,Access was great - a lot of the garden was accessible and there were lots of benches around
6395,The Elm Tree is a wheelchair accessible cafe and tearoom in the countryside with indoor and outdoor tables. They serve great food and a wide variety of delicious cakes.
6396,The accessible bus from the airport stops outside the front door. Disabled parking was at the rear of the hotel. The electric push button entrance is at the rear of the hotel. It's a 200 yd walk to the main bus stop where you can get numerous buses into Dublin city. All of the Dublin buses we used had access ramps and the drivers were very accommodating.
6397,"Radar key operated accessible loo, though it wasn't locked when I visited. Very well equipped and clean. Well done, Yorkshire Water."
6398,"This is a tiny little delicatessen located on Street Lane, that has the most divine food - they make everything fresh, and you can go there for any meal or just a snack. They also do takeaways if you fancy taking something home with you.  As well as the food they make, they also have a cheese counter, a salad bar, deli and bakery, alongside a shop where you can buy delicious treats.  They have a ramp to allow access, as well as an outside seating area (for when it gets warmer). Unfortunately they do not have any customer toilets, so it needs to be a quick visit. It is a small cafe so sometimes when busy it is not accessible due to limited space to move around, particularly for people using mobility aids.   Staff are incredibly friendly and will help with whatever they can. Always had a fantastic experience here. "
6399,"Very large car park with designated disabled parking, fuel station with LPG provision, fully accessible.  Bus services are Lothian 4, 5, 26, 42, 45, 49 and East Coast 7, 124., both stops are adjacent to the store on east and west bound sides, there is a crossing nearby. "
6400,"There are no steps into this crowded spot, but the restaurant is small and spartan with a no-frills interior. "
6401,"Very disappointing approach to hotel, the area is dirty, unkept paths and uphill push to reach hotel (photo 1) from New Street station, the area was awful, not impressed at all, there’s road works everywhere during September 2021, pot holes and ramps to fight, not impressed. Entry into hotel  was easy enough through an opened wide door (photo 2) and direct  into reception (photo 3) which is very basic. The staff were all friendly and helpful.  However, there was litter everywhere around reception area, no one turned up to clean anywhere, the tiled floor could do with a mopping. and it was same the next day. The lounge and bar is next to reception (photo 4) comfortable enough, but we found chairs were too close together and difficult to get through gaps, but there was a space to leave wheelchair or powerchair   The public disabled toilet is near reception, (photo 5) but floor area needed cleaning up, wide door with pull handle to get in (photo 6) but it’s nice and big, I could spin wheelchair in there and it had grab rails and pull cord. (photo 7). There entrance for lifts was wide, easy enough to move around (photo 8) and three good big lifts (photo 9) but we found using lifts frustrating. You have to put your room key into slot and  pull it out again to then press the floor button you need, but it did not work every time, I was in and out trying door key, reporting it to reception, and having key reset,  very frustrating. When you do arrive at the corridor for rooms it was very nice looking in warm wood colour (photo 10) then most unusual, you pulled your room  door open into corridor area. Entering disabled room (we had disabled room 0512 )  it had a long passage (photo 11) passing toilet, and the disabled room was very attractive, nice deco, and quite large (photo 12) Bed very comfortable and a good nights sleep given. By the entry door was a nice square area to leave wheelchair in,(photo 13) so it was out of the way. The bathroom is a good size although WC pan is rather close to sink, (photo 14) and it’s a good walk in shower (photo 15). What impressed  us as well is the excellent lighting in the room, and two long mirrows at each end of room. However there is no desk to work on you use round table instead, but it had a nice ottoman it base of bed. We both felt this was one of the best disabled rooms we have had over the years. Breakfast is taken in the restaurant (photo 16) with views over city buildings, easy enough to find room for my wheelchair, although I prefer to sit in seats provided, as I am able to stand, and the breakfast selection was ample, and well prepared (photo 17) and the seating is quite comfortable (photo 18). Our final thoughts Very disappointed by the appearance of this hotel and the area it stands in. The hotel floors were dirty and unkept. The lifts were frustrating as the card system did not always work. The disabled bedroom however was excellent, clean, and plenty of room to move about, we felt it was one of the best we have had so far. Either we are both perhaps to fussy, but we felt we would not particularly recommend this hotel, although once inside and moving about it was quite good, but not suitable for power chairs, as certain areas are a bit tight.  But it is very handy for the main railway station, and once work completed on the roadworks, it might be a lot easier to get from hotel to station, and that would be a plus for disabled people."
6402,"We only used the one on floor 1. It wasn't very clearly signed but once we found it, it was fine - grab rails, an alarm and reasonable space."
6403,"The staff were great, They waited outside the toilet to make sure I didn't need any help. The staff always want to help."
6404,There is a fully operational disabled toilet however it is right next to the main entrance so can be a bit difficult to manoeuvre amongst the loiterers.
6405,"The soap factory is very small, a single room at the back of the shop. From the street the entrance there are a couple of steps into the factory. The first room is a shop and there is a place to sit while you wait for the tour to start. Then there are 2 steps, see picture, into the factory itself. Although the corridor is quite narrow, there was a manual wheelchair user in the group, whose wheelchair was able to go into the factory. There were seats put out for people who required them so I could sit while I watched the demonstration, which was in English. The tour lasted about 30 - 40 minutes and afterwards there was the opportunity to buy their soap in the gift shop."
6406,"Access to the seats is pretty bad for those in chairs or  unsteady on their feet, with uneven  ground the main obstacle."
6407,There are benches available and the paths are of a reasonable width and reasonably smooth however the paths do make a full circuit you have to turn around if you use a chair.  There is a tactile map thing and another information board which is audible with no written text. 
6408,Parking right outside front door of cottage.
6409,Not very big at all (see pics). In fine condition and no RADAR key required. There were red cords in both hanging low and already had Euan’s Guide cards on :)
6410,No toilet and directly attached to the venue. However large accessible toilet was available during the festival in St Andrews Square garden.
6411,Not radar keyed. But no abuse of facilities. A good size for a manual chair. 
6412,"There is plenty parking on the onsite car park, and disabled parking spaces right at the entrance "
6413,Very friendly and helpful. 
6414,"The ground is level with few steps however it is hilly, rocky and uneven. It's traversable in a powered vehicle of some kind be that a powerchair or class 3 scooter, but not in a self-propelled or manual chair. "
6415,Nice large accessible toilet on the viewing balcony.
6416,"Wheelchair accessible garden centre with attractive cafe and other outlets including Aquarium, clothing, food and household goods."
6417,"Tucked inside the university's science campus, the library is close to a car park. It is around a ten minute walking distance from Lothian Bus Stops, and around five minutes from the university shuttle bus (also an accessible Lothian Bus - but beware this service can get very busy during term times)."
6418,This cafe is inaccessible to wheelchairs as there is a step at the entrance and no ramp available.
6419,As a means of public transport the DLR (Dockland Light Railway) is great as you can roll straight on and off the trains with a wheelchair. Once on the train there's a dedicated wheelchair space.
6420,There didn't seem to be any special arrangements for cars carrying disabled people; you just park in a queue to get on the ferry like everyone else.
6421,"On the ground floor there is one changing places loo & 2 regular disabled access loos. These are clearly signposted. I love that to access these toilets you need a radar key, so there is less chance of the facilities being abused by people who don't need them. The disabled access loos are on the way to the regular loos, which is great as you can 'walk' to the loos with the person you've gone with, rather have to find a separate  facility. On this visit there was a queue so I did have to wait a few minutes. There was a cleaner/attendant outside monitoring the loos & they were able to unlock the door for a wheelchair user who didn't have a radar key with them. When she beckoned me over to the first free cubicle for me to use, I got in there to discover that there was feaces on the toilet seat so I turned straight round & went out. The attendant asked what was wrong & I said the toilet seat is.... & before I could think of a polite way to describe what i'd seen, she said ""messy?"" Yes! Messy, thank you, and she went straight in there and cleaned it very thoroughly & without fuss! The toilets while not massive, are big enough for me to turn around in my powerchair. There was plenty of loo roll & the soap dispenser had soap in. The hand drier was super quick too. "
6422,Staff at York Train Station are very helpful and easy to speak to. As well as this they are also very willing to help with the carrying of any luggage to platforms if required.
6423,"On arrival there are no signs to indicate where the wheelchair access to the building is (there are many steps at the front of the building and access is at the rear). The proprietor had parked her car across the only pathway leading to the rear and I was only just able to squeeze past with a narrow active user manual chair. Once at the side of the building I had to negotiate long grass (and a decaying corpse of a seagull) to the rear entrance. This would be extremely hazardous to anyone with walking difficulties/crutches/visual impairments. The rear access had a very high door threshold and a narrow doorway. Most wheelchairs along with all power chairs and scooters would find this impossible. Furnishings are rustic with heavy bench seating made from pallets, only one table is suitable for use by a wheelchair user that cannot transfer to a bench seat with high sides"
6424,I have given it this rating because in my small electric chair and some nifty driving I could get in all but one very small area which had a step. It is flat and ramped throughout but the turns are tight. You would not be able to go round in a scooter or very large adult chair. The cafe is flat and ramped with wide spaces. Entry to the museum is through the small gift shop and a standard sized door. There is flat access to the river path and outside eating spaces. This is a visual experience where the teapots are behind clear Perspex and rooms may be claustrophobic for some people as it is wall to ceiling shelving on every wall ( see photo).  You can paint a pot at the cafe tables. Even if teapots sound boring - you really may change your mind after seeing these!
6425,The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They informed me where I needed to go to get to the various collections and helped me with the lifts too.
6426,There are no blue badge spaces in the car park however the car park is very large at the weekend it does fill. There is a bus stop near to the venue and both sides of the road. Local buses and First bus in Airdrie all stop at these stops.  The venue is in Deeds St to get in to the car park you have to go round the back of the building.
6427,"As we use a stand aid it was a bit tight for space, but we managed OK. There is an overhead rail available for hoisting."
6428,The staff were very friendly and helpful.
6429,"Fantastically helpful,they have a true disabled lift designed for wheelchairs, it's fab"
6430,"See the opening statement - The access arrangements are not really fit for purpose, I have no way of understanding how someone would fair who is unable to self propel or who is overweight or unfit."
6431,Level access throughout lower floor and into auditorium.  With advanced arrangements seating can be made available for  wheelchair users at front of auditorium. Lift access to upper floor studio and workshop.
6432,"Now you can enjoy the beach with the rest of your party on these FREE specialized wheelchairs. You have to book a time slot in advance though. See the photo for details of contact etc. The office block where you get the wheelchair is conveniently located next to an excellent café and opposite disabled access toilets. Parking is also very good. The famous West Sands at St Andrews is even better now as you can enjoy being on the beach in a purpose designed wheelchair, hence the whole family can participate. You can even do a Chariots of Fire run of your own ! These are free but you have to book in advance. Contact details are on the photo."
6433,"We parked very close, in the disabled spaces attached to the City Hall. It was great to be so close, but scowly faces at Sheffield City Council, who are messing with all the roads in the city centre, making actually getting to the City Hall quite a feat at the moment. "
6434,Really great to be able to get on the beach and move about which is impossible with standard manual wheelchair.  Was able to push the beach wheelchair a little into the water too which was real fun.
6435,The toilet was easy to find and did have grab rails. As I'm not a wheelchair user I don't know how much space there is but from what I can see there looks to be enough room to manoeuvre.
6436,"Staff were incredibly helpful, supportive and friendly. Thanks staff!"
6437,"The staff I meet at reception, in the cafe, the waiting areas and during the performance I had gone to see were great. Offering directions, help with tickets, refreshments, and making sure I had a good experience. I felt included and welcome which is not always the case. As I told my friends afterwards ... it was all so seamless and it seemed so normal ! As it should be ..."
6438,Staff are helplful
6439,I have used the wheelchair spaces here a few times and although not ideal because of layout and position in the auditorium it’s better than nothing. Although on this occasion I was angry at being charged £18 for a ticket to find that my view was blocked by 2 cameras filming the concert. I was even asked by the cameraman if I could move my chair back so he could get access in front of me. Then the usherette asked me to move forward when I said the camera man asked me to move back??? Her reply was they shouldn’t have sold these seats for this show !!!!! So disabled people have to be denied because of filming not that maybe they could find another place for their cameras?  Shame on you concert hall poor night all in must try harder 
6440,"Staff are very helpful. They will take you too a table, explain how the restaurant works and offer any assistance if required. "
6441,"The Helix park and around the Kelpies is wheelchair accessible, however there are steps at various parts of the  attraction these can be avoided.  "
6442,Everywhere is accessible - fantastic
6443,Always happy to help
6444,Accessible toilets are available on the ground floor of The Grosvenor Cinema on the right just after the ticket counter. Adequate cleanliness and basic aids were in place.
6445,"Access as a wheelchair user was through a door tucked away to the left of the main entrance. It does have a sign at wheelchair height so you know where to go. Heading through this you come into the ticketing desk area and shop. All very bright, light and spacious. Beyond this is the entrance to the Cafe.   The Cafe has moveable furniture so it's easy to find a spot that suits. The floor is level and there are no doors to get in as it's open plan."
6446,"Picturehouse has a Council car park nearby with free parking for blue badger users.  There are local accessible buses,  taxis and train stations."
6447,"Very low(about 2 inch) step to enter. Once inside good disabled access to all apart from 1 small room. Easy ramp to disabled loo. Very old building with preservation order, so anything larger than a standard hand wheelchair would struggle to get to loo. Otherwise good access"
6448,"Accessible loo in reception area ,easily located, entrance through 2 doors, angle looked quite tight, so did not try accessing it.Large area with plenty of room to facilitate turning. Grab rails in place, but only one at side of toilet, would benefit from a drop down rail at other side of toilet. Higher than normal toilet. No emergency assistance cord in place.Room for a carer. Bathroom in hotel room, plenty of grab rails around toilet and one at sink, higher than usual toilet. Perch stool in corner of bathroom, but shower although large was quite high to access 3-4 inches, with no grab rails, and  a surface that would be very slippy when wet. No shelf in shower for toiletries, no emergency assistance cord. Could only access toilet and sink, and had to reverse chair back out of bathroom, no room to turn, and no room for carer"
6449,Friendly and Helpful.
6450,Wheelchair accessible toilets in both ladies and gents toilets.  Two fairly stiff doors to enter toilets.  Probably need help to get back out.
6451,This has recently re-opened after a major revamp. The car park has vastly increased but sadly the place has lost a lot of its charm.  A much bigger cafe and outdoor seating area which may improve with time. The interior is now painted sludge grey/black and is just not welcoming. The sensory community garden however continues to be a delight.
6452,Friendly and helpful
6453,"Very Good - Profiling bed with a carers bed in the Accessible Accomodation but NO HOIST, there is an Accessible Hot tub on your patio WITH A HOIST, NO HOIST or shower trolley in the Accessible bathroom, NO HOIST in the Accessible swimming tropical pool but there is a height adjustable shower trolley"
6454,Could do with few more
6455,Great hotel location - right on the lake! Large spacious rooms with balcony views. No ramp to access balcony - disappointment!
6456,"Lovely old house set in beautiful grounds in the East Lothian countryside. Level entry access with automatic door entry to reception. Tastefully decorated in keeping with the period to achieve a country hotel feel. Staff are very welcoming - nothing is any trouble. Staff training is clearly evident at all levels. Although it is an old property, accessibility has been taken into account. "
6457,"The centre has excellent accessible facilities.  I arrived using their Silk Street entrance, which is at street level, and slopes gently into the centre of the complex. There was step free access throughout my entire visit, with automatic main doors and lifts. I visited Cinema 1 which is on level -2. When I exited the lift there was a foyer with seating area and ticket desk, at standing height.  There are 2 step free boxes at the rear of the auditorium and directly accessible from the foyer. I was in box B. It had a private entrance, with 2 manual doors. Inside the box were 2 free standing chairs, it was spacious and would accommodate a wheelchair user. There was an excellent uninterrupted view of the screen. It is secluded and private, so I felt confident storing my crutch and knowing it wouldn't be in anyone's way. I felt like royalty. All the other seating in Cinema 1 involves steps with a single handrail. There is an induction loop in the auditorium. Assistance dogs are permitted in the cinema but there is also the option to leave them with a member of staff. They have access film screenings with both audio description and captioned film in the same screening. Also relaxed screenings."
6458,"4 disabled parking spots right near pub that also serve the train station.  Not sure about bus access but it is right by Windsor Riverside train station. We drove, but got the following access info for the station off of trainline: “ There is level access to all platforms until around 20:00. After 20:00 access to the station is via three steps and wheelchair users may require assistance.”"
6459,"From the creative mind of the architect Piet Bloom, experience unique houses that were designed to look like a modern forest.  Constructed in 1977, this site contains 38 regular sized cube houses and two larger cube houses.  Each home is tilted 45 degrees on a hexagon shaped column that serves as the home entry point and staircase.  Though entry into the museum cube  is not wheelchair accessible, the unique neighborhood has a wheelchair accessible ramp so you can enjoy the home exteriors as well as a couple interesting shops and a small chess museum."
6460,disabled toilet outside visitor entrance accessible to all
6461,"Clean and tidy. Good space to get in with carer, but not wide enough to turn round."
6462,"We visited on a Saturday late afternoon and it was quite quiet. The whole store (clothing section, not food) was nice and spacious with plenty of room for me in my chair with my assistance dog next to me. The fitting rooms have an accessible one with rails, hangers and seats and again, plenty of space, even for my dog to undress me."
6463,Parking is available on site.  The nearest railway connection is Croy Station and there are local accessible bus services.
6464,"Staff very helpful, holding doors, etc."
6465,"Historic house owned by the National Trust. Disabled parking, buggy that will take a wheelchair from parking to house. Disabled loo near parking & by house. No lift in house, but film of rooms available on ground level. Wheelchairs for use on ground level & 1st floor. There are stone steps from ground floor to 1st floor. All staff/volunteers very helpful."
6466,Amazing. Can't do enough for you.
6467,There is an accessible loo and it's easy to get to.
6468,"The Gondola cars can accommodate wheelchairs and the operators will stop the Gondola cycle to allow access to wheelchair users, until they are onboard and fully prepared for the journey ahead. and there is disabled access to the Snowgoose Restaurant & Bar and the Pinemarten Cafe Bar at the Gondola Base Station.. arrival at the Top Station. "
6469,The toilets are located towards the rear of the restaurant with and uneven entry to the toilet. The toilet is unisex and not for the sole use of disabled people. There is manoeuvring space enough for a wheelchair and there are transfer rails and support bars present. Also the toilet has an emergency alarm. The tap uses lever and it mixes both hot and cold water and an automatic hand dryer is available.
6470,"Staff were really helpful and keen to answer my questions about accessibility. The manager, Anna, is very keen to ensure that all guests get a pleasant experience."
6471,Fine on my scooter.  Some steep paths would be hard on a manual wheel chair. The site is quite spread out. 
6472,"A disabled access entrance is placed at the site of the main entrance. This operates using a call button, meaning you are not able to get into the venue independently without requiring the help of staff. Once inside there is a small dining area with stairs to the left. Other areas of the pub can be reached via a lift though I did not have the opportunity to use it. "
6473,"Gregorio was an excellent driver, very knowledgeable and he spoke English well. He was extremely thoughtful and considerate throughout the tour and would sometime park the vehicle so I could get a good view without having to get out. "
6474,"Many good things to say about this pub, not least the food and the helpful attitude of the staff.  Its not perfect, by any means, but for a building this age - its very, very good."
6475,"The McManus was somewhere I'd read about but not visited. It turned out to be a great find with lots to see, good access, parking and coffee!"
6476,This is a very recently opened venue and it would be interesting to visit again in a few months time. I'm always looking for a new 'coffee venue' but I won't be returning to Bella Italia for a while.
6477,This was very clean and tidy with full hoist and changing area.
6478,The disabled car park is very close to the door too.
6479,"As explained in part one review, it’s handy as near to hotels entrance, but difficult to then get in via the ramp, as told in part one, so please read that as it shows you how to get in."
6480,"The entrance, reception and bar is really accessible and with good signage to the lifts etc.  "
6481,Staff were helpful.
6482,The disabled toilet is easily found and there is adequate wheelchair space for maneuvering. Grab rails are also provided. The toilet was quite clean.
6483,"Access was great!  A lot of bird hides are wheelchair accessible with space between benches for a wheelchair user to get close to the windows.  The quality of the paths was great - some are tarmacked and those which aren't are still really level, even and make for a smooth ride.  My carer found it easy to push my chair which hasn't been the case in other reserves we've visited.  "
6484,"Steps at main entrance, and long ramp to access No automatic doors No wheelchair height check in, but was manageable  2 lifts to all floors, a bit of a squeeze with the power chair  Good signage, plenty of seating for a rest. Induction loop noted. Doors throughout the building were very heavy, help is required to navigate "
6485,You don’t really interact with staff very much but there is always someone in the information booth. 
6486,Accessible toilet in wet room and plenty of space for carers to manoevre. Only problem I had was that my own high backed shower chair didn't fit over the toilet.
6487,Ample parking outside main door.
6488,Not really suited for wheelchairs with some steep slopes but the main shop and cafe is easily accessible.
6489,Generally good access however within the restaurant it is not very spacious and could be difficult when maneuvering.
6490,These pods are on the North Coast 500 route so a car or vehicle is a must
6491,"Level access, a little crowded with tables. One disabled toilet. The white rose centre itself has a changing places that are seperate to the pizza express."
6492,"Very friendly, very welcoming and could not be more helpful."
6493,Amazing! Really friendly and helpful in the cafe.
6494, Arrived by car. Disabled parking close to room access.
6495,The access is generally good with a level door to get in and an automatic opening function. The signage is good and the space is wide and open with plenty of room for different sized wheel chairs etc. 
6496,"As a main station there is no parking but you can drop people off. There are plenty of public transport options from the trains themselves, the underground, plenty of buses and taxis."
6497,"The National Rail Museum at Shildon is ""sister"" to the NRM in York and as such has many interesting exhibits together with some Steam Locomotive ""visitors"", e.g Flying Scotsman.  The lower car park has spaces for Disabled visitors and the whole museum is on the level, except for a couple of elevated areas which are easily ""climbed"" There is a shop and a cafe and two sets of Disabled Toilets which are easily accessed and spotlessly clean. Entry is free but there are Donation boxes at the doors The staff are all very pleasant and helpful."
6498,A large car park with Blue Badge parking not too far from the main entrance. Free parking for disabled visitors.
6499,Lothian buses stop a few minutes away. Parking is available underground.
6500,All the ones we met were helpful and aware of disability issues.
6501,"The entrance to the building was totally flat, when entering the different sheds there were a few steep steps, there was a ramp at the side of each staircase with handrails on them for easy access. When looking around the museum most of it was spacious and easy to get around. The café was lovely however we feel as though it would have been difficult for a wheelchair user within the designated eating areas as the tables and chairs were very close together in a small space. "
6502,"This is our 3rd visit to Homelands and each one has been better than the last due to the consistency of delivery and continued improvements to the little things that can make a difference. MY wife who is severely disabled with MS loves being there (and close to some of her family) feeling secure and catered for, as well as having lots of choice of things to do to keep busy. This is the 2nd year in a row where she has been able to get the foundation of a sun-tan on the first day - so we have been really lucky with the weather! You come away with the feeling that there is a caring team at Homelands who want your visit to be the best it can be - we will certainly being going back again."
6503,Very helpful
6504,"Small step at the entrance but apart from that, everything was extremely manageable for a wheelchair user such as myself. "
6505,"Wagamama restaurant is all entirely flat. The dor to enter from the outside entrance is heavy though, it’s not a power door.   The biggest problem is access inside the restaurant is tight, all the tables are quite close together. Some areas are better than others for access, where we sat I had to squeeze through a very tight gap which required asking strangers to move their chairs slightly. It was definitely manageable for myself (my chair width is 48cm/18.9” excluding the wheels) but I wouldn’t call it good access. A different table may have helped though, I’d recommend sitting near the loos"
6506,Couldn't have been more helpful. Friendly and attentive.
6507,1.8 meter height restriction into under ground car park free for four hours. lots of disabled  parking spaces on the lower level  lots of drop off spaces on the surface but no droped kerb
6508,Welcoming and helpful.
6509,There were 3 spacious accessible parking spaces.
6510,"On a number of occasions I have witnessed staff being very helpful to assist commuters by providing access ramps to the train, wheelchairs to ensure that people have everything the need to complete their journey. Staff at the customer service desk in the entrance to the station are friendly and helpful."
6511,The accessible toilets are open. The other public toilets have been reconfigured in places and there is new signage to show people which way to enter.
6512,"The Mall is good for access as it's dead straight, level and an easy to follow route with Buckingham Palace at one end and Admiralty Arch at the other."
6513,"One of the big chains of cinemas, the Vue Cinema in Stirling has 8 screens and shows all the latest films. We found it to be accessible by wheelchair, and staff were friendly. "
6514,The staff were excellent. When I arrived they checked that the table was suitable for me. When I asked for a toilet they took me to the ones on the same level as the restaurant. When I came out I spoke to the nearest member of staff who immediately went to get the manager (sorry I didn't get his name) he was very apologetic about the lack of disabled access provision. He explained that the toilet I used had been installed about a year ago before that they had no toilet on the same floor as the restaurant. I explained about the lack of grab rails and he agreed to raise it with the company. 
6515,"I did not communicate with staff much.  During my visit, I received an important phone call and was asked to talk on my phone outside so that I did not disturb others.  In some ways, it shows that they are making efforts to ensure others have a good experience."
6516,The staff are great and there was no rush to make you order your meal or when they came with your bill at the end of your meal.
6517,"Everyone was really happy and friendly, the bar staff were friendly probably because very few people where overly merry. The security guards even seemed in a good mood as there was never any trouble."
6518,Great Atmosphere. Has level access from the street and accessible bathroom with clear sign posting. 
6519,"Wheelchair access at this museum is generally very good, but I encountered some annoyances with lifts and toilets."
6520,I went here for a rugby game ... the disabled seating reminds me of a bird watching box ... my carer was unable to stand up due to the height issue for the viewing area. The biggest and most dangerous issue was the nails and screws and staples that were showing through the ceiling and not even removed to protect people. We had to ask Scottish rugby to help us and they did but this is a issue by Kilmarnock fc as they own the stadium!
6521,There is a middle of the road pavement which has no dropped curbs so be careful you are not dropped off here! At the front of the taxi queue there is a cobblestoned area with space for vehicles to pull in
6522,"I had problems accessing the cinema's service on one notable occasion. I had my card and online ticket receipt, but my guest did not happen to have her membership card at the time. It took a considerable amount of time to prove that my guest also had a membership card, because the needed data was not readily accessible in their computer system. Obviously, this is not the norm in our society with the use of membership cards (e.g. gyms, libraries, etc.)."
6523,"Hotel is very easy to find, just off the ring road - head in direction of the train station. Plenty of open air parking right by the front door, including dedicated disabled parks. Apart from needing a confirmed parking space with  extra space on passenger side, we had no specific requests.  But while we were there, a Swiss party with disabled guests arrived, who needed much more space to park and unload etc.  They had called in advance, and the hotel was very happy to accommodate them.  We know this, because the staff  let us know, so that we would not park in the space allocated to them."
6524,the access is very good as it has Lifts and also escalators for people with a disability 
6525,"The sport centre is level access throughout with cafe, sports halls and ice rinks on the ground floor, and lift access to the first floor where you’ll find the spacious gym area, studios and lounge/restaurant/viewing area overlooking the ice rink."
6526,"Level access into the shop itself, small seating area with 4 tables but can accommodate one wheelchair or 2 if quiet."
6527,"I visit this pool regularly with my Mum, who is almost entirely reliant on a wheelchair. The access to the pool is graduated and they have a pool chair which you can borrow so you can get into the pool. The staff are always very helpful and willing to lend floatation aids etc. It tends to be a quite quiet during the week, but with different kinds of users; children, 'serious' swimmers and disabled people (obviously some of these groups cross over; someone could be all three!).  There are two disabled changing cubicles with showers. Where the water is shallow, they have a ledge to sit on, where there are bubble jets you can ask to be put on - the closest option to an accessible jacuzzi available locally.  The only criticisms would be that the bar around the side of the pool is difficult to grab onto, and the locks aren't great on the cubicles; they can only be locked and unlocked from the inside, which isn't great if, like me, you're trying to combine privacy with safety."
6528,"There is a proper Changing Places toilet here :)  Lots of standard accessible toilets here, and (for a football ground) very clean and tidy. Access via radar key - when we got there the stewards checked we had a key, and offered to lend us one if needed. "
6529,The staff I spoke to were very friendly and helpful.
6530,"There was a reasonably big car park, although the blue badge parking spaces weren't super near the house, and from what I remember there were some gravelly surfaces to negotiate. However, I think you could be dropped off nearer the building if necessary. I'd be surprised if there was much in the way of public transport here, as it was quite off the beaten track."
6531,"This was our 3rd visit to Elderburn Cottages staying in lodge 6 which is the adapted cottage. We have always had a friendly welcome from Anne when we arrive and she is very helpful to the extent she changed a base bed to a frame bed to allow underneath access for our sons hoist and stuck down a rug in main lounge to stop the wheelchair rolling it up,  - excellent service.  this cottage is spotlessly clean, spacious and well appointed, has 2 bedrooms and open plan lounge/kitchen with also a large wet room toilet which is great for us. We find Anne keeps to very high standards in the cottages, we particularly enjoy the peace and quiet at this location which along with the no dogs policy makes it more attractive to us. Location is very convenient for Craigtoun park and to St Andrews with easy drives to the East Neuk. We have already booked again for august this year so that tells you how much we enjoy our stay at Elderburn and we would highly recommend as being wheelchair friendly."
6532,Milport Cathedral is a hidden gem I did not expect to be able to access. It is a beautiful building which you can explore some parts of the layout are quite narrow and difficult to negotiate in a wheelchair. I visited with my family on a summer day trip. It is so peaceful it is well worth a visit
6533,Free parking including mini bus bays and disabled bays all free . Good publis transport links . The nearest metro station is Gateshead stadium which is wheelchair friendly . A beautiful walkway all level surface with only one minor road leads you all  the way to HH Hair Design .
6534,"Helpful – menus and food brought to table, staff very pleasant"
6535,There were standard loos but no disabled loos.
6536,"BOOKING: I called to make my booking as there is no facility on the website to book wheelchair spaces. ENTRANCE: The theatre has a step-free entrance at the front. The electric door is operated by a large, well-placed button. LOBBY: The lobby is quite spacious but can get very busy prior to the show. The ticket desk has a lower counter for wheelchair users. LIFT: There is a lift to the Stalls (-1) and Royal Circle (1), big enough for one wheelchair and one person standing. BAR: The bar is on the same level as the Royal Circle (first floor) and is step free. WHEELCHAIR SPACES: Spaces in the Stalls are at the end of rows. This is fine (great views of the stage) but awkward during the intermission when people want to get past you. If a space is required in the Royal Circle, a seat is taken away and a wooden platform is set in place. The view is excellent and if carefully parked, there is enough space for people to get out for the intermission without having to move the wheelchair."
6537,"Getting to the bank was easy on all counts. A disabled parking bay is located in the adjacent street, bus stops are outside and it's opposite Waverley Station. Not too far from the tram stop in St Andrew Square."
6538,Parking is good and easy although only 5 disabled spaces. Parking is close to the entrance on a tarmac surface. 
6539,"There is no parking, other than on street, associated with this building. But there are good bus services to the library and a bus stop fairly nearby."
6540,Friendly and helpful. Go our of their way to assist where necessary
6541,I drove and there is an accessible parking bay close to the entrance of the reception and cafe.
6542,"Just returned from an amazing week at Sara's cottage in Truro, Cornwall.  My husband is a full time wheelchair user and we have struggled to find lovely accessible accommodation. Sara's cottage ticks all the boxes!    As we drove down the long driveway with its beautiful wild flowers and saw the cottage we had the inkling we had picked something special. Parking outside the cottage was on level ground, no gravel and a very subtle ramp into the front door.  The accommodation is all on one level, so much thought has gone into everything.  The doors are wide and the rooms are spacious.   Lounge/kitchen was perfect with a kitchen table that was suitable for my husband to roll under perfectly. The kitchen was so well equipped and no expense spared with lovely glassware. We cooked a full roast dinner on the Sunday with ease.  The welcome pack was a lovely touch and the home made scones with cream and jam went down a treat. The conservatory leads from the kitchen and is a lovely place to view the garden and all the beautiful birds that feed off the bird feeders.  The garden was a joy and there was plenty of space to sit outside and have a bbq.  The accessible bedroom with ensuite wet room was perfect for us.  In fact I would say it was far better than many hotels we have stayed in.  The bedroom was spacious with plenty of room either side of the bed and the bed was just the right height for my husband to transfer easily.  The wetroom was brilliant , it was well thought out and practical but didn't lack style and design.  Again the extra little touches were much appreciated. There was an extra grip bathroom handle that could be placed where you wanted.  The sink was a good height, mirrors were well placed, hand held shower as well as overhead shower and good designed hand rails.  The owners live in the house nearby and were available for any questions before our trip and during our stay.  They also  have a wealth of knowledge regarding the local area.  We were very impressed with their website for the cottage, so much detail and also great recommendations for days out and restaurants.  The location of the cottage is brilliant, its just outside Truro in a rural area and a great location for visiting different parts of Cornwall."
6543,"It’s great that they have a disabled toilet, unfortunately on buffet day they use it to store stuff in, so it’s not available for customers and they don’t seem to realise this isn’t acceptable and are quite rude about telling you it’s not available."
6544,"The park is situated up a fairly steep hill, but there is a car park with a few accessible spaces beside the park. We took the Metro and walked - it was quite a distance and there are steps/escalators to navigate if you don't drive all the way up to the top. You can also get a bus up the hill but I'm afraid I don't know the details."
6545,Church of Notre Dame du Port is a neo classical church overlooking Nice Port. On Sunday afternoons during the winter season it plays host to free classical music concerts performed by Orchestre d'Harmonie. 
6546,As I said in my review earlier I have Would not class it as wheelchair friendly. 
6547,"The welcome I received from the staff and the locals was particularly friendly, it’s easy to see why they have won awards and the visitors book again full of accolades and high praise for great service. Whether in the bar, at dinner or breakfast the service was fantastic. This is one Hotel I will go back to without hesitation."
6548,The accessible toilet is inside the main entrance to the Gentlemen's toilet which is excellent. When the toilet is adjacent to the Ladies I always find lots of non disabled patrons use the toilet which is really annoying during the interval. The toilet was clean and reasonably spacious. 
6549,"A bakehouse and wine shop - the stuff of dreams! Great cake, and fairly good access - although room for improvement. Staff are lovely!"
6550,"Signage was minimal, there was no seating to rest on, from the parking to the venue.  Access to the food festival was off the main path, onto and then across the grass which was muddy in places.  Difficult with a walking frame.  No matting to make it accessible for difficult at best. Site of the festival itself is on a slope and very muddy, again with no matting in the area's of heavy footfall."
6551,Although you have to use lifts and a subway to change platforms the station was well laid out and accessible.
6552,The accessible loo on the ground floor is right next to the standard loos - which mean there is generally a queue and people using it. It is also next to several stairs - which means that depending on which way you approach it you might have to nip back out in to the courtyard and back in through another door to get to it - once you know this though it's easy.
6553,"Nice, friendly welcome from staff when I arrived. I had a chat with Daniela Vasco about Wellcome's ongoing commitment to improving disabled access. Wellcome appreciate that people might be feeling anxious about going out and she suggested that people could contact them to discuss their access needs."
6554,"This is our favourite restaurant locally for special occasions a deux, family lunches and afternoon cakes after a walk along the canal.  Excellent food, friendly helpful staff, ample parking, everything on the level, and level with the Union Canal towpath"
6555,"Great little pub. Serves breakfast from 10am. Great food menu. Range of food from burgers, ploughman salads, bar food, steaks, sandwiches and specials. Range of soft drinks, ales, coffee etc... Traditional beams country pub. Large car park. Wheelchair accessible. Very friendly staff. Good value."
6556,The entrance and exit doors are separate both consist of a two sets of double doors these are automatic. There is a short gap between the doors.  On the way in to the store there is a push style barrier this is like a gate it does move out of the way if you push but it might be a bit of a problem for someone using two arm crutches or walking sticks
6557,"There is an 'accessible' toilet. Access to it was blocked by a huge stack of chairs which it took two men quite a while to shift out of the way. The toilet is too small, there is no room to park your wheelchair for a sideways transfer to the toilet (if you need this, stay away), there is no emergency cord. So it's a kind of half-hearted stab at the idea of an accessible toilet. Could be better."
6558,"I travelled by public transport to Gladstone's and it was easy, cheap and accessible. I travelled by train to Chester. Opposite Chester's train station there is a bus stop S4, next to the Town Crier public house, and from there the 4 and x4 buses to Mold depart and take you to Hawarden.  Buses have one entrance/ exit with a ramp and wheelchair spaces. Buses are about every 30 minutes during the day. I didn't find the service 100% reliable, as the 2pm didn't turn up when I was travelling there and I ended up getting the next bus about 20-30 minutes later. There is a shelter and seating at the bus stop so it was ok. The journey took about 30-40 minutes and the bus driver was helpful and told me when I reached my stop, which is the Glynne Arms. From there it's a five minutes level walk to the Library. On the way back I left earlier to ensure if a bus was cancelled I would catch my train. Again a bus came 20 minutes after I had expected one, and waiting at the bus stop directly outside the Glynne Arms was difficult as there is no seating or shelter. The pub has a low wall, but I would not have been able to get up again. Public transport is a good option but just allow yourself plenty of time to travel in case buses don't turn up as planned.  There is a car park for guests."
6559,"I recommend this pub strongly for wheelchair users. Apart from two great annoyances with the accessible toilet, everything is just right."
6560,"Staff are always helpful, always welcoming and friendly. They always ask if you need any help, and are approachable.will help to carry  & pack goods. In the cafe they will carry your purchases over to your table and move furniture etc"
6561,Friendly and accomodating. 
6562,Pretty great! Once you're in the building it's all step free. What was brilliant at the weekend was that it was free seating so you could choose where you sat and although we were towards the back it was still a good view. 
6563,Helpful staff.
6564,"(See pictures attached) Little ramp and a door to get into where the loos are, I needed help holding the door as it’s hard to open while going up the slope in a manual chair. Disabled loo is unlocked (no radar key needed) and the door is very light. Nicely tiled disabled toilet / baby changing room. Not huge but a decent size. Just a basic disabled loo so no adult changing. Plenty of rails and a full length mirror on the door. Red emergency cord hangs all the way to the ground but with the lock (see pics) not sure if someone would be able to get in from the outside in an emergency, though there might be a way - I didn’t ask."
6565,There is a Radar Key Toilet on the Right hand side of the pier this is the side nearest the Tower. It was clean and useable however the grip rails on both sides of the toilet its self were rusty and would advice care if using.
6566,A wheelchair could get in and out alright.
6567,"Didn't have much contact with staff. A main customer service desk in the foyer seemed to be busy. There was lots of information like bus timetables, a shops map and other leaflets."
6568,All access was excellent except for the ramp into the entrance; this was smaller than could be provided and made for tricky access and egress.  However I am aware that the historic nature of the hotel and the street must be constraints.
6569,Easy to park and good range of level access shops but no public toilets.
6570,Very helpful company that delivered to our hotel so that my father could use it  on arrival.
6571,"All the staff were courteous and friendly. Karen , and her husband , the managers, could not have been more helpful."
6572,A small but navigable step at the front door.
6573,There was really good access to disabled toilets which were easy to find and clean.
6574,Access is good with a curved ramp taking you down to the changing area.  The disable changing room is very spacious and has a height adjustable bed for those that need it.
6575,"There is an accessible toilet within the Farm shop area of Longparke. It is a reasonable size for an accessible toilet, with enough turning space for a wheelchair/powerchair and space for two people if someone requires assistance. Within the toilet there is a small baby change bench and grab rails beside the toilet and sink. There are two bins inside the accessible toilet however, when I visited, they were neatly tucked in the corner. The emergency red cord was tied around one of the grab rails which I untied before I left and left a Euan’s Guide card.  It would be good if there was a Changing Places toilet though, to allow customers who are unable to use standard accessible toilets to visit too. "
6576,Staff are very welcoming and helpful 
6577,The stations are all accessible easily and there are the usual ramps into the guards van and the staff are very good in making you feel secure when getting into the van. In some vans you can get into the loo in some you cannot. They are happy for you to sit by the windows and watch the scenery go by.
6578,"My husband e-mailed twice about accessibility, but as we received no reply, we just turned up. There are no accessibility arrangements for this venue at all and the gig we had booked was on the top floor."
6579,There is an accessible toilet but it is not particularly large and may be tricky for some larger powerchair users to negotiate.
6580,"The approach to the old pub lies in beautiful scenic countryside (photo 1) around the delightful ancient small town of Henley in Arden. ( Set your Sat NAV for B95 5 HJ) and it stands alongside the Stratford and Avon canal (photo 2) in the village of Lowsonford. One of the famous buildings here is the Fleur de Lys (photo 3) originally a 17th century public house, by the same name, and was later known for its pies, baked here in the 1950,s. The pub supplied many of the counties fish and chip  shops, before expanding its sales nationwide, and then taken over by Pukka Pies, a firm based in Leicestershire. The Fluer de Lys is named after the job of a Murenger, an officer who had charge of the wall of a town, perhaps originating from the pub in Newport, Gwent. His job was to collect tolls for the repair of town walls, and these taxes were called Mirage. Following our lovely drive to get here, and set alongside the canal, the old 17th century pub looked inviting when we saw it. (photo 3) and the car park is large, on hard core, ( photo 4) so easy for wheelchair use. No actual disabled bays, but all parking is close enough. Easy access to the entrance door over paved slabs (photo 5) all on the level, with a nice shady place to sit under large canopy.  As you enter the pub, (photo 6) it has kept its character with that olde world appearance, and to get in it is all on the level. There is a seating area on the flat as you entered, ideal to place your wheelchair or scooter, i(photo 7) and a powerchair could manage, although in limited areas, but unfortunately, to get to the bar to order there are steps, (photo 8) so your carer would have to do the ordering for you, so a disabled person would not be able to get to the bar area, or even to get to the well signed toilets, as there are steps from now on. The bar has a character with a rustic appearance (photo 9) with plenty of old world wooden beams, you can imagine life here in the past. The large log burning fireplace has plenty of logs stacked ready for use (photo 10) so warming and welcoming on a cold winters day. Exiting the pub, they have endeavoured to try to brighten up the area with a colourful display of a few plabts, (photo 11) and if it is a warm day, suitable to sit outside, a disabled person could manage quite well, with plenty of tables and chairs under cover (photo 12)  but there is another area under a large canopy, by the staked hay bales, but this has large chippings on the floor, and that would be difficult. Beyond this you find a large open grass field with table and chairs alongside the canal, (photo 13) which was very picturesque, and easily enough for wheelchair to be pushed across. Our final thoughts. If the weather is warm enough and you can sit outside, it is worth the visit, the ride through pretty countryside in itself is worth taking just to get here, then it’s an attractive olde world 17th century pub, with an historical story to tell, but the inside of the pub is not at all disabled friendly with lots of steps, and we could not find a way on the flat to reach the toilets. If you can sit outside, it’s very pleasant with lots of shaded canopies if hot, or to protect you from a sudden shower or two. You will get your chair across the well kept grassland for views over the canal, so all in all, for outside use we could recommend taking the afternoon trip and enjoying the olde pub. But because of limited use for disabled we will only offer 2.5 marks. We did this trip as part of our historical canal trip, which we will offer you a full detailed review of the days trip itself in our final review for the whole trip, combining everywhere we visited, which makes for a delightful day out, and one you can manage quite well."
6581,"Always very friendly and helpful, where patient when receiving tickets."
6582,"The building is easy to get into with doors that open automatically. The route to the cafe is easy to negotiate with only one, internal door that is tricky for a wheelchair user to open without assistance. A smooth floor without steps or thresholds is welcome"
6583,The accessible toilets are easy to find and they are also gender-neutral toilets.
6584,Albert 1'er Hotel is  three star hotel opposite Jardin Albert 1er (gardens). It's an old building with a contemporary interior. It has about 70 rooms including 3 accessible rooms with walk roll in showers. There is a 24 hour receiption desk and a breakfast room on the 1st floor.
6585,"There is plentiful parking on site, and Jacqui/Carl will give details of car parks wherever you go.  They will drive you anywhere if needed."
6586,"Toilets not well signposted, and corridor a bit narrow , but toilets clean modern, with plenty of room to manoevere wheelchair, more than one accessible toilet available"
6587,room with adult sized bench and hoist downstairs in main building at the back
6588,Parking outside Hope Cross Cottage is accessible.  As our stay was short we did not investigate other means of transport
6589,Not enough staff to help direct visitors where they want to go. Signposting in the building is very poor. I joked to an American couple who couldn't find the exit that the museum wanted to keep us as exhibits.
6590,"Accessible, but more importantly they have made a clear space to get into the loo. No tables in the way."
6591,There is no real parking on Bread Street but there is parking on surrounding street. Nearby Lothian road is serviced by many Edinburgh bus routes. 
6592,There a wide and entrance to the cafe however there is a very small step but it should be easy to get in. The space inside is Wide and open with enough room to easily accommodate several wheel chairs or power chairs. 
6593,"fine and accessible, if a little far from the bar - toilet in hotel rooms fine."
6594,All doors were wide enough for my large electric wheelchair. It was level access from my car to the log cabin. 
6595,Steps no handrail
6596,Really large with space for wheelchair user to transfer and carer if necessary.
6597,The hotel was just a few minutes walk from Haymarket train station (0.4 miles). It is only 1 mile from Edinburgh castle and central transportation links. They do not have a car park
6598,"York Train Station is a main line train station which covers York, Yorkshire and England as a whole. York is a relatively small city but the station is very busy with commuters. The station has very good disabled access and staff who are willing to help you if you require.  The station also has two waiting rooms and a number of benches around the station."
6599,Accessible Costa Coffee near the seaside with friendly staff and very chocolaty hot chocolates.
6600,"This is one of my favorite places to exercise, the paths around the park offer plenty of options and the gardeners do a fantastic job of the planting every year.   Facilities are great and the food at the MAC is reasonably prices and good.  The park also has tennis courts and mini golf whilst the MAC has a cinema and art gallery."
6601,"As the centre for life is in a busy city, as expected the car parking is limited on site. Luckily for myself I attended the venue with a blue badge holder so we were able to park on site however this had to be prearranged on request to the visit which we thankful looked into the parking before attending. There was a fully accessible car park located close by to the venue called Times Square Car Park opposite the Jurys Inn hotel. The venue is also very close by to the train station and metro"
6602,"Two toilets with wheelchair access. Two toilets with step free cubicles for men, 1 toilet cubicle block step free for women, 1 toilet block with one step for women. No light on the women's toilet and my husband paddled through liquid in the men's' by the tortoises. I used the wheelchair accessible toilet here. Very large, gritty floor due to the outside terrain. Not a full compliment of support rails. You have to be a gibbon to reach the toilet paper. Lift up tap to get water flow."
6603,This is a newly built centre and the personal care/toilet facilities are brilliant. The accessible toilets are big with a hoist etc in one of them. There is also plenty of space throughout the garden centre.
6604,"The whole venue is wheelchair accessible, every stage has a wheelchair accessible option. An informative and fascinating place to visit. Whether you have and active interest in aircraft or naval history or not. There is a lovely viewing gallery where you can sit and watch the active airfield if you find the whole thing is tiring. Adjecent to it is a nice cafe, serving good food and good portions! "
6605,would give manager 10* so helpful with directions and helping us.  Such a pleasure to be looked after.  We felt safe.
6606,Sound as a pound. They'll give you a hand choosing which beer you want and any other help you may need.
6607,The staff are helpful and knowledgeable about their hearing loop. Hopefully it will be fixed for the next visit.
6608,"Helpful, friendly, held doors open."
6609,Toilets for disabled persons only. High level of cleanliness and hygiene
6610,a baby changing facility with a disabled toilet as an afterthought by someone without a clue
6611,I parked in the eastgate centre and then walked to the coffee shop (About a 2-minute walk!) 
6612,Street parking available
6613,Very helpful
6614,This accessible country park has a few different walking routes that you can take and beautiful scenery to enjoy.
6615,"Disabled loos impossible to access using most wheelchairs or walkers or similar - due to shelving and boxes lining the corridor on the way. Not signposted. The disabled loo is also the ladies. Generally clean, but very little loo roll and no sanitary waste disposal services. Cord was tied up, and I'm not certain it is still in operation."
6616,Disabled parking right at door and accesible Toilets inside
6617,"A Victorian railway station that has improved much over time, currently well sign posted with friendly staff whom are happy to help. Wheelchair access is made difficult due to masses of stairs leading up and down to platforms, there are lifts although these do not prove time-efficient. It has connections to many points in the country, however limited and expensive exterior parking."
6618,Low step up from the pavement and quite a heavy door but the staff are alert for wheelchair users and quick to help.
6619,"I was interested in going to Strathaven Hotel after hearing that it had been sold and refurbished. I was concerned that I would not recognise a place I had been going too since I was a child. I was pleasantly surprised to see the front entrance exterior was still the same. Inside is great. The refurbishment looks great. It is spacious with level access throughout the ground floor. There are 2 separate bars, a restaurant, versatile private rooms and a large function room. We went for dinner. It was lovely. It was rather quiet but there was still a nice atmosphere. There are plenty of parking spaces just outside the venue and there is a disabled toilet on the ground floor. I was told there are 6 bedrooms on the ground floor which are easily assessable for people who are disabled/have mobility issues. The bedrooms also come with a walk in shower."
6620,Be aware that the farm is mainly cobbled with has some tight areas and stairs so someone in a wheelchair may struggle. However there are alternate routes to avoid the stairs. Plenty of seating around the farm for rest stops.
6621,Access was after ringing a door bell. We were led on a long trek through the backstage of the venue. Some were backstage and were quite narrow so not sure how easy in a wheelchair. Staff did try to be helpful but I am not sure realised the accessibility issues. Venue had raised seats apart from front row but we were allowed in first
6622,Ususally plenty of street parking outside Hall but there are several car parks nearby as well. If you arrive by bus or train it is a short trek to the Hall near the riverfront.
6623,"We walked, but the cafe is near lots of public transport in this part of Northern Quarter."
6624,could have been bigger - no changing bench of any type and was difficult to do a 360 degree turn.
6625,Overall the Taverna is a good restaurant with a very good value lunch buffet. But what really made the visit great was the staff. They were flexible and welcoming and weren’t faxed by us either being a big party or that one of our party used a wheelchair.
6626,Sandy beach with rock pools. Benches to sit and stare out to sea... Small beach so it's perfect just to chill out for half an hour!
6627,The admissions staff told us the path up was steep (we could have driven up) but omitted to tell us the main gate to the site led to steps and there was an alternative gate! This wasn't labelled and access was up a steep grass bank - the kind guide in the museum opened it for us on request. The single star is for him and his taking the time to point us in the right direction inside the fort.
6628,On arrival we were asked the stand outside to wait for our table to be ready. The main restaurant room is crowded and due to poor acoustics almost unbearably loud.
6629,"There's a dedicated car park but spaces can't be reserved and it's pay per stay. It was £6 overnight, no concessions. I was worried we might not get a space but midweek there were plenty of disabled bays.  The way round to the entrance was a short distance but some large planters made the pavement a tight squeeze for a wheelchair."
6630,"The visitor centre had an accessible loo. Large, bright and clean and tidy."
6631,"Staff are usually helpful if a little slow to recognise when & what is needed, and are friendly if at times blunt."
6632,"Parking just outside, can't recall if specific disabled spaces"
6633,"it was on the second floor, need to climb the stairs to access, lack of physical aids."
6634,The accessible toilet was fine in terms of access and space but it was very unclean.
6635,"Extremely helpful and accommodating, taking the wheelchair and returning at the end of the performance."
6636,4* hotel with 5* disabled facilities. This hotel has the best disabled facilities I've seen. Bathroom has grab rails at the toilet and a great shower with a fold down seat and a shower stool. Even the hairdryer is at a low level.  The wardrobe in the bedroom has a pole so you you can pull the rail down to access your clothes at wheelchair height. Toilets in reception area are disabled friendly and toilets at the pool also have accessible showers. Pool is quite small with no access for disabled. Plenty of sunbeds and chairs. Restaurant is fantastic - staff reserve a table beside the buffet for disabled guests. Food choice is excellent - always piping hot. There's an onsite  music lounge with tribute acts every night. This is open to non residents as well so is always really busy. We found this quite difficult to move around in a wheelchair but we enjoyed the acts.
6637,Staff were fantastic and made me laugh with them asking if that was the guy I was down to support for every Scottish boy who walked out haha and when Ross Houston won they thought I was going to jump down 10 foot and sprint towards the cage and jump the barriers and climb the cage - but I can barely walk hahaha. Can't speak higher- staff were amazing!
6638,OK if arriving by car or HCL not so great for buses. Nearest stop is Easter Road.
6639,Lots of parking. You can park near the cottage for loading/unloading.
6640,There is a Taxi Rank at the gates and a Taxi fare from the Albert Docks area to the ground is around £7.00. There is some parking available in the Streets around the ground on non match days  However on match days there are restrictions on both the Taxi rank and on street parking so many hours before kick off. The club website gives details on this and is something that changes due to games being rescheduled for television etc. There is also a special bus that runs from the city centre Albert Docks area to the ground and again you will find details on this on the club web site. Did not actually see the bus which is a double decker to know if wheelchairs can access the lower deck.
6641,"I was so happy when I found out about this new extension as it used to be very difficult getting in and out of the older part of the practice, the new one is so much better, very easy to access all round. It also looks great! It is always perfectly clean. The last time I went to the new premises the door was open but this time it was closed, I managed to follow someone else in, otherwise I would have needed help with the door. The access is smooth and step free.   On entering you look ahead to the waiting area, and to your right is the reception desk. There is hand sanitiser but I bring my own as its easier, so I didn't use this and it looked a little high. I went to the far right of the waiting room where there is a space next to the sofa. There is a table in front of the sofa and there's a chunky cube stool next to that, this partially blocked the area I was sitting, but I was able to manoeuvre around it no problem- although staff did offer to move it. My power chair is quite long and has a rear wheel drive. The waiting room is spacious and has beautiful wooden flooring which my manual chair would have glided easily on! The reception desk is low so you can see staff easily for checking in.   Once I was called in, this time I was taken to a different room, the hallway is quite narrow so turning into a room was a delicate manoeuvre! This wouldn't be a problem in a manual wheelchair, but something to be aware of for bigger chairs. I was taken into room 3 which was much smaller than my previous time in room 1. Room 2 and 3 are only divided by a partial wall, there was also no room to bring my chair up side by side to the dental chair. I asked if someone else was in as I have been shielding and I didn't feel comfortable having dental work in the same space as someone else is. I didn't have to say this though as Rhu was walking through and told the girls I could go to room 1, before I was even fully in, which I was relieved about. Rhu is aware that I have been shielding. The staff were friendly and helpful, none of this seemed like an issue to them which is always a relief when things need changed slightly! Room 1 is great for wheelchairs, and I believe room 1 and 4 both have doors so there is no other patients in the same space. In room 1 there is plenty space and is also must easier to get in as you go in a straight line from the waiting room. I can line up my chair easily next to the dental chair. The photos I have attached are of this room. There is also enough room to turn so I do not need to reverse out the room. "
6642,"Toilet/Bathroom inside the accessible room was fantastic! It was almost like another room. Roll-in shower with guardrails and handlebars. Emergency cords were accessible. Again, the best I've ever seen. No hassle at all."
6643,Local pub that serves food
6644,very friendly and helpful
6645,"The nearest bus stop is on the Northallerton high street as this centre is on an industrial estate.  It would be advised to use a car to get here where possible.  Plenty of parking available.  Even if disabled spots taken, there is lots of on street parking and it is a quiet area,"
6646,Nice and helpful. Happy to carry over your food if you're on your own.
6647,Saw everything in our wheelchair buggy. Some things could be a little lower like mouse town and the windows in the enchanted walk could be to.
6648,"Wheelchair access into this restaurant is close to the main flight of steps down, consisting of a platform lift. On occasion this platform lift can be unreliable, but the staff are always happy to help if there is a problem. The ramp at the bottom of the platform lift is a little steep, and the route from the lift to the door of the restaurant is narrow, but even my powered wheelchair can cope with this.  The door is usually propped open, but is light and easy to open should it be closed. Inside the wooden floor is smooth and easy to navigate, and the tables can be moved between. The online booking form to reserve a table does include a special requests box where, if you state that you have a disability and the needs that arise from this, you will be accommodated perfectly and willingly. I have never been made to feel unreasonable when asking for a table with more space around it for the wheelchair.  The bar is a little high up, but drinks can be ordered in the restaurant section anyway.  A disabled toilet is available, although full changing facilities are not.  The staff are always friendly, polite, and helpful. They always speak to me as well as whoever I’m with, and never seem to begrudge any extra support that I might need.  The Botanist is near the train station, several bus stops, and car parks, and is situation on a route popular with taxis. The pavement is level and smooth. "
6649,"In the middle of town so it's easy to get to, and there is parking in the Corn Exchange car park which is a couple of minutes walk. "
6650,Alex our server was really friendly and really helpful.
6651,Staff were really helpful. They explained that some of the heritage trams were not accessible but these are interspersed with the main modern trams. We were helped to manoeuvre into the wheelchair space and to get off safely at our stop.
6652,"Disabled seating is upstairs. There is a lift for wheelchairs, however it is small and if a lot of people are using it it can take a while to get up/ down"
6653,This is part of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill group and is a few minutes of the motorway as you enter the Town of Moffat and is aimed at the tourist trade that passes the area. They sell a wide range of goods from clothing for adults and children as well as a range of Scottish clothing Kilts etc . They also stock a range of food and have an area that is for Whisky. There is also a good size café but we did not use this during our visit. The store is laid out in sections as you would expect and has good signage for each area however there is not a lot of space and if you are in a wheelchair it can be an issue to move between display in some areas such as men's wear.
6654,"When on the beach there are always at least two lifeguards who walk up and down the beach, as well as the lifeguards who are at the lifeguard station right next to the level access part of the beach that has easy access sun loungers and wheel chairs on. They are more than helpful to ensure that all of your needs are being met and that you are safe whilst you are at the beach. When I am on the beach it allows me to feel a lot safer to know that they are regularly monitored and if I had any concerns, that they are willing to talk and help. There is an ambulance that is based next to the beach throughout the whole day and there are also the local Police that cycle along the boardwalk through La Cala and the whole of the Costa del Sol,  ensuring that it is a safe place to visit. Also all the staff in the restaurants are very helpful with any requests and ensuring that your needs are being met. This is very important as it makes dining out when you go to the beach a lot more relaxing and easier."
6655,This is a venue that has really put some thought into its accessibility to ensure guests with disabilities feel as comfortable and as safe as possible...
6656,For such a big place they could do with more toilets dotted around. The accessible toilets were clean and spacious and had enough room to fit my care and my wheelchair in and there was enough grab rails. Enough room to manoeuvre my wheelchair around in.
6657,"I emailed in advance of my visit to request clarification on bringing my folding walking stick into the venue for the concert. I did not receive a response and followed up. I finally received a response on the day of the event, after I had left my home. I was informed I would have to cloak my bag the stick was in but that this would require me walking up stairs. Their website said the cloakroom was closed due to COVID.   It is also worth noting that they checked NO ONE’S COVID status, despite LOTS of information and reminders on their website, social media and via email that proof of COVID status would be required."
6658,"Lovely, helpful staff . Always willing to help."
6659,"Very friendly, very helpful."
6660,"Friendly, quick and communicative "
6661,"Accessible toilets in visitor centre, plenty of other accessible toilets easy to find around the site. All that I used have grab rails and are large enough for a carer and wheelchair if necessary."
6662,I don't know because I don't drive. Taxis very close by in Park Place. Plenty with ramps. Multistorey public carpark in Greyfriars Road.
6663,There are reasonably helpful
6664,"The staff I spoke to were very helpful and polite, and talked to me like a person. "
6665,"Of course you will have to go back inside to the hotel, but if you chose to go out at the rear of hotels exits to gardens, then other toilets are available, so we have dropped the stars for this reason."
6666,Access in and around the building:  The building has a prominent entrance. The reception was bright and light with good signage. There was a hearing loop which was indicated by a prominent sign.  The lift had good contrasting controls and braille buttons. The doors to the bedrooms had good signage.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The accessible bedrooms were bright and spacious. The bathrooms were well lit. The rooms had a large button telephone.  The fire alarms in the rooms had the usual audio sounder but were also equipped with flashing lights. Vibrating alters for pillow were also available for hearing impaired guests.  Access in the dining area:  The dining area was large and well laid out.  Access to other facilities:  The hotel also had a bar and lounge area.
6667,I saw a sign for accessible loo but didn't use it
6668,There was one there but I didn't use it.
6669,There is a ramp to the outdoor seating area and the doors are just wide enough for a wheelchair to access the indoor seating area.
6670,We drove. The Hayling Halt car park is loose large gravel that the car boot scooter couldn’t cope with. We had to park blocking a gate to unload the scooter directly onto the path.
6671,The whole building could be easily accessed by wheelchair users. There is no inaccessible part of the building as there are ramps lifts and additional doors where necessary
6672,"There was a housekeeper at the end of the phone line but we had no reason to contact the lady, and she had the house  clean and tidy for us arriving, also they were some essentials in the house,"
6673,"Very helpful and friendly, keepers were doing talks about their animals too which was very interesting."
6674,Although the building is across 3 floors there is a lift to access all floors. There is dedicated changing and shower room for disabled visitors and a seperate disabled toilet on the first floor next to the gym. All of the facilities and toilets are well signed. Doors are wide and easily opened. Floors are hard and corridors are kept free of clutter. There is step free access throughout the club even down to the pontoons on the river.  Basically there is no impedement to access. It's so refereshing to go to a club that is fully accessible. 
6675,"I didn't see any signs for toilets on the pier, but there may have been some in the amusement areas or in the cafes/ pub, which I didn't go into.   I did find an accessible toilet plus non accessible toilets near the entrance to the pier. This involved turning right on exiting the pier, following the slope until it met the path that goes under the pier. Then going towards this path to  the pier the accessible toilet is on the right hand side before their pier, see photos. The accessible toilet is not easy to find when you are walking towards the pier as the yellow sign, see photo, is on the back of the cubicle. There was also another sign saying radar key could be obtained from the attendant in the ladies. However when I went into the ladies, there were pay gates and I didn't see an attendant and when I called out I got no reply. The toilet was spacious and had grab rails. Sorry I don't seem to have a photo of this toilet and I can't honestly remember if there was a red emergency cord."
6676,M+S in the middle of town but is adjacent to main road therefore drop off points there but no room for nearby parking
6677,There is on street parking and a multi-storey at the nearby Stirling Shopping Centre. The train station and bus station are also close by.
6678,"Middle of town, so easy to get to using public transport. Not as easy with a car, due to lack of parking spaces in the city centre. "
6679,You need a car to reach Penshurst Place and the disabled car parking is clearly sign posted. There are 6 - 8 disabled parking spaces but these are on thick gravel which is very difficult to wheel over.
6680,can't comment. looked the part.
6681,The first bit of the walk is quite steep and can be a little treacherous but it is safe to use and the hole path is actually quite safe I've used it a number of times you will get muddy wheels though.
6682,Parking and transport is a bit tricky as it is a city centre garden square. You can be dropped near the entrance if required. The Square is very close to the West End of Princes Street where there are loads if transport connections.
6683,"Accessible inside but, oh dear!  What happened to the electronic doors?"
6684,"Hello Falicity, Mark Jo and I have had the most wonderful time and we recommend you both to anyone"
6685,Level access to the building and 2 lifts. I asked about wheelchair accessible rooms which they do have. They suggested requesting this in advance to ensure you get a fully accessible room.
6686,Staff member was reluctant to hold the disabled toilet door open... thankfully my assistance dog knows how to do this!
6687,"Very good automatic doors ,lifts wide isles only a small lift to top floor disabled trollies to attach to your wheelchair"
6688,Very helpful and friendly with plenty of staff located on each floor and available to help. 
6689,Limited for wheelchair users. 
6690,The accessible toilet can only be accessed if you have a student card that is synced to the pass system. This is something the university are looking into to make it more accessible to students or guests who need facilities but don't have a card. There is a sign at the door handle which reads......    Inside there is ample space to move around.    There is a large mirror with shelf space which is great for resting books or bags on. The sink is small but space underneath to roll under. There is a red cord on the right hand side of the toilet which..
6691,"Trailfinders Sports club in Ealing London. Been here twice now, once last September and again on 14/4/17. On both occasions to watch Rugby League team London Broncos and to attend a coaching course in the Pavilion.    The ground itself I found accessible in my active manual chair completely propelling myself.  The club house has a ramp access on the side. A good sized disabled toilet.  Only small criticism is the bar is high for chair users. All the staff, match stewards and fellow fans all really helpful.  Car parking is good for access to both venues."
6692,"The venue is a couple of miles from the town centre where the River Ness meets the Moray Firth, therefore you would need your car or take a taxi to visit if in a wheelchair, otherwise it is a long walk. They do have a minibus service though if you don't need a wheelchair. The ticket office is very roomy and accessible, as are the adjoining cafe and toilets. Everything is flat and spacious and I found no problems when I got there.   I was really impressed by the smooth and manageable ramp leading down to the boat and once  on board I was really pleased to see how much room there was; I could turn very easily and was able to have a 360 degree view.  If the boat was really busy, this might have been a bit more difficult.  I had the choice of sitting both outside on deck or inside and both had amazing views!"
6693,"Following along a lovely driveway towards the hotel, passing open pastureland, you arrive at the disabled bays right outside the main entrance into hotel, and it’s all easy and on the level into the reception area."
6694,See above 
6695,"The exhibition is on level 1 and the easiest step free way to get to the exhibition is to arrive from Belvedere Road/ Waterloo Station, rather than from the River Thames entrance. If you are facing the Royal Festival Hall from Belvedere Road walk across the courtyard and make for the far right hand corner of the building, walk round the corner and follow the building round to the main entrance on the left. There are several doors, but I think they are all manual opening. The step free entrance to the exhibition is on your left immediately after the doors. As the exhibition is by timed admission this is the area to wait until your tour starts. The exhibition has 9 different rooms. The door frames from one room to another are very narrow. The website says that only wheelchairs less than 80cm wide can fit and motorised wheelchairs do not work on the uneven surfaces. Pre- booked Southbank Centre manual wheelchair are available for hire. Their website says turn up 15 mins early if you want to borrow one. I used one and although only an occasional wheelchair user and not very good at steering, I found it generally very easy to self steer apart from a few of the doorways (due to the narrowness and angle in relation to the design of the room). There were a couple of places where there were ramps, my friend really struggled to get me up the 1st ramp, so after that when there were ramps I  got out of the wheelchair and walked, but I'm mindful that not everyone will be able to do that. There was also one room where there was uneven surfaces and it was a little difficult to self steer. The exhibition itself is excellent, but in terms of accessibility there's a couple of small things which could have been better designed, there are a couple of rooms where there is video footage and this is with a small, low level TV screen which depending where I was sometimes my view was blocked by other people, so I'd suggest making for where the screens when you go into the room. There are cases with archival documents, costumes, etc and some of them due to the small size of the rooms, the layout and the other people made it a bit difficult for me to view everything easily from my wheelchair. The first room is dark when you enter and the lighting gradually increases. The exhibition has fmGenie wireless communication system designed specifically for use by people with a hearing loss. At the end of the tour there are steps to exit but I was escorted by the tour guide to a step free exit which involved going outside for a minute or two and re-enter the building where the tour started so I could return the wheelchair and collect my crutch. The gift shop is on level 2 which is easily accessed step free via the JCB Glass Lift (the singing lift)."
6696,"All on one street level, ramp to the right of 'the cross'."
6697,No problem whatsoever accessible toilets are quite large and we negotiated with the frame with no problems.
6698,"I found the toilet spacious enough for my wheelchair, the drop down rail and pepermant one made transfer easy, as was the raised seat.  As one would hope in a disabled toilet, whether it be in the UK or Fuerteventura. "
6699,"The access was perfect, signage was clear. Staff were helpful. Chairs were moved quickly to make sure I had room and the people in front and behind me had space without my wheelchair interfering. "
6700," Disabled access is fine , And there are no major issues surrounding this.  Plenty of space to move  between tables.  The only slight problem for wheelchair users   Is the height  counter,  to   Compensate for this however staff will come around to the front of the   Counter with the chip and pin machine .    While  I was enjoying my meal   Another wheelchair user entered the restaurant with two  Non -  disabled friends, I witnessed this lady  do  a  side  transfer  independently from her manual wheelchair onto one of the fixed seats in the restaurant.  "
6701,The accessible loo is quite spacious but not always that clean. There is no changing places toilet. There is a large baby changing room which is sometimes cleaner.
6702,By car.
6703,easy access and plenty of room for wheelchair inside. friendly and helpful staff . Relaxed ambience and tasty food. Thoroughly enjoyable. Went on back on the first review on this site and fully support what they said. Would definitely go back again
6704,Parking was good as there was easy access but it would be best if it was tar-maced as there were pot holes filled with water. 
6705,"Staff we're really good. They went out of their way with everything from giving directions, a guide to take us to the roof garden, and assistance throughout our visit."
6706,"Single yellow line at door, easy to get in and out as no steps and one slight slope in restaurant."
6707,"There is a ramp to one entrance, and the doors open wide. However, these are not automatic doors and are relatively heavy, so a person in a wheelchair would be dependent on a secondary person to gain access. There are rails on the staircases, however, not at either entrances to the building. There are no lifts, but there are a few rooms downstairs which are prioritised for those with a disability. However, these rooms are small. Throughout the house, the corridors are wide and stone floors, so easier access."
6708,Clean but a bit tight on space
6709,Great wheelchair access with everything on the one level and no stairs to enter the restaurant.  Also the staff are very helpful and  nothing is a bother.
6710,"We have been twice to I Need a Holiday too.We had a lovely time both times,excellent accommodation,beautiful scenery and excellent hosts.Jackie,Carl and Max will do everything in their power to make your stay as comfortable as you wish. Would recommend it to anyone disabled or not."
6711,Plenty of disabled parking right next to the visitors centre and cafe.
6712,There was a lot of staff scattered around the place to help people. They were very friendly and helpful. 
6713,The attraction is completely wheelchair friendly and on one level. Guide dogs are also permitted. Staff are happy to help in any way they can.  Audio tours are available whichbis fantastic for anyone who has difficulty reading.
6714,Staff were polite.
6715,There is a disabled access toilet though it somewhat narrow and maybe difficult for some to negotiate 
6716,You access through the front door but then are shown to the area.  The slope up to the area is quite steep. There is a disabled access toilet. 
6717,"Couldn’t be more helpful to fulfill accessible needs.  Once entering the park, you visit the nurse and supply a copy of a letter explaining your condition and receiver everything you need and your access pass to save queuing. "
6718,While there are no disabled parking spaces no spaces are marked so there is plenty of space. It would not be possible to get public transport but you could probably get a taxi from Glenrothes.
6719,In a mall with a couple of marked parking spaces and a badly marked ramp.
6720,"Fully appointed, clean and well serviced toilets given the popularity, ample room for wheelchair and carer."
6721,"The former railway line to Vincennes was transformed in the 1990s into a linear garden and walkway which stretches for 4.7km from a start near the Place de la Bastille in the heart of the city to the Square Charles Péguy. Much of the traIl is elevated and offers fine views of this part of Paris, and most of the route is wheelchair accessible. The sections that have been turned into a linear garden are beautifully planted. The eastern part of the traIl is shared with cyclists. There are a couple of road crossings but these presented no difficulties. There are two lifts to enable wheelchair users to access different sections of the trail. The start at the Place de la Bastille end is not wheelchair accessible, but the short wheel/walk along the Avenue Daumesnil past the workshops and studios of thr Viaduc des Arts is very interesting. Turn left into Rue Hector Malot and you will find the first/last lift access to the trail."
6722,"Nice paved parking, with plenty of extra parking space.  Easy to find due to very good directions."
6723,"I would have given five stars for the staff  as they were really helpful, did not rush us or make us feel rushed. Nothing was too much trouble. Once we had the disabled ride pass just getting the pass  was ridiculously difficult and pc gone mad tbh The guy who pushed my daughter round and round in a big police car was fantastic, his rapport with my daughter was so sweet."
6724,"There is parking all the way along the High Street in Dunbar, the bus stops are within 1 min of the Bakery. The Railway Station 5 mins."
6725,Accessible vehicle available to book for assistance in getting around 
6726,"There are several blue badge spaces on the promenade, and here's a tip on how to find them from my Norfolk-based uncle Les. When you drive into the town, find the Morrison's petrol station. Look across the road from there and you'll see a fish and chip restaurant with a sloping driveway next to it leading down from the town level to the promenade. There are 'access only' signs on this to stop traffic going down - but ignore those, because this access is for you and your blue badge! Drive along the promenade a few metres when you get to the bottom of the slope and you'll see the blue badge car park.  The only drawback is that it gets quite full - we were lucky to take the last available space."
6727,"We thought that the 'round' was a great space and we liked that you could remove the front row of chairs to accommodate more wheelchairs. This is also true in the Rake theatre.  We also liked how friendly the staff were, taking the time to show us around. We really enjoyed the cafe as we could all sit together easily and the staff were thoughtful and considerate of our groups needs.  The prices of the cafe were reasonable and the toilets were spacious and clean.  The access to the building was over the bumpy cobbles, but they have ramps into the building, and could assist  people to get in other parts of the building - the access points were also signposted clearly. When we rang the door bell that answered the door really quickly.  We would like to come back with our families."
6728,Accessibility is there at the front door but once inside the restaurant's tables are condensely packed and maneuverability is a bit difficult for a wheelchair. Ask to be seated at the back to see the Stage at a comfortable angle.
6729,"You need a carer to open the door.  Then the carer has to attract the attention of the staff who may be serving other customers in the main dining area, at the front of the Restaurant."
6730,All fine
6731,"The RADAR accessible toilet is often out of order. When the baby changing table is folded up there is just enough room to be able to turn in a powerchair, and a carer would be pushed for space with larger wheelchairs. The hygiene of the toilet has been variable, due to it also being a baby change facility"
6732,"Accessible toilet just inside entrance, clean, handrails, emergency cord, room for a carer."
6733,"Ramp up to door but difficult to steer wheelchair in as not much room at door. Not on any public transport routes, fair walk from closest bus stop round the back of an industrial estate."
6734,"I attended the House of Commons in July 2018 for #Trailblazersat10.  We were escorted through as a group via a flat walk way through security. Guards offer to put your VIP laylards over your head if you lack the ability as common courtesy which I thought was great! We were then taken inside where we had to go up in the lifts. The lifts are VERY small so we each (many wheelchair users) had to go up in the slow lift with an older gentleman escorting us. It did take near an hour to get everyone to the floor the event was on.   Although I didn't use it this time, there is a Changing Places toilet in the House of Commons, all you need do is ask and you'll be escorted to it. You'll even have a security member wait outside to assure all is well!   The rooms throughout are lovely and spacious for navigating in a wheelchair. The only thing I'll say is due to the structure and decor, it is very dark inside so my visually impaired partner did struggle somewhat. "
6735,"Signage to the accessible loo is very poor, but it's spacious and clean. The red cord was too short but I'm confident that this will be resolved."
6736,"Next to all the public transport, this Morrison's Cafe is in a very handy place in Partick.  You can enter the Cafe through its own doors, or from a door linking it from the main Morrison's supermarket."
6737,large public free car park beside the restaurant with 2 disabled spaces beside the restaurant and more at the castle end of the car park
6738,Large car park with disabled spaces near the door.
6739,Easy to find and good parking.
6740,There were staff members on hand to talk about aquatics and an activity where you could touch some if the creatures (crab and starfish) again these were an accessible height.
6741,The staff are all adorably friendly and bend over backwards to be helpful. They made our visit a really happy and relaxing experience.
6742,Great accessibilty in John Lewis itself. Large lifts up to all floors (cafe is on top floor) and there is an accessible loo on the same floor as the cafe. Only problem for us was the lift which takes you from the John Lewis Carpark into the shopping centre as it was a very tight squeeze for my brother's powerchair. His is a large chair though so might be fine for many other wheelchair users.
6743,There is an accessible toilet with handrails installed.
6744,"I travelled by public transport. From Bristol Meads train station I got a bus (70 or 73) outside the station which took me to The Centre"" an area with a number of bus stops, and from there it was about a 3 minute walk to theatre."
6745,Accessible toilet on restaurant level (main toilets are downstairs) 
6746,Plenty of disabled spaces
6747,Public Car park with blude badge parking spaces.   All Blue Badgesspaces  are pay and display
6748,"This a wee hidden gem in the village of Duddingston on the outskirts of Holyrood Park.  It is a very quite and peaceful garden which is pretty accessible in some areas, allowing everyone to enjoy some of the best bits of the gardens."
6749,"Opened just over 3 years ago, this is an excellent, medium-sized venue for wheelchair users. A few disabled parking bays in the surface car park - and many others in the multi-story next to the venue. Lifts inside to all levels inside the venue and 4 wheelchair accessible disabled toilets.  Unfortunately, these do sometimes get used by the abled-bodied - particularly if it's a comedy night - and especially by lazy or tanked-up men who can't  be bothered to walk a few yards or wait in their own queue to use the loo. Several good wheelchair spaces in the front stalls - or the front row of the circle if preferred or for standing/unreserved gigs. There is a restaurant and a café which serves lovely curries on most comedy evenings or snacks or sharing platters for other shows. We go to this venue frequently - probably once a month or more as it attracts many of the big names in comedy which we love, but we've also seen great music gigs too so there is something for everyone here."
6750,Helpful and talkative. 
6751,There is multiple disabled parking spaces outside of the pub. All are straight outside the door and easy to spot when you enter the car park. 
6752,"Very helpful, and did go out of her way to try find a shower seat or similar to assist with the bath problem."
6753,"Bluewater could do better at putting disabled spaces right in front of the restaurant part of the mall, as if you just want to eat it can be difficult."
6754,"The medical museum has it's own car park with disabled bays, and is situated on several main bus routes and a main road, making it easy to get to despite being a long way from the train station. The entrance to the museum is level, and while the first door is manual (but permanently propped open), the second is automated (swings outwards). The desk is right by front door, and it would appear sensory kits are available for autistic visitors. All displays are fully wheelchair accessible, although some are narrow in places, with tight corners. Some displays are too high to see from a wheelchair, but most are at an accessible height. There is lift access to all floors, and the lift is large. While there are disabled toilets, there is also a full changing place available in the basement. Considering that ableism is an issue in medicine, the subject of disability was mostly well-handled if under-represented."
6755,"The Palace of the Parliament (otherwise known as 'The People's Palace') was built during the Nicolae Ceaușescu administration, although ironically, Ceaușescu himself never actually got to enjoy the Palace as it was intended due to being overthrown as the leader of Romania in 1989 and then executed, along with his wife, on Christmas Day of that same year. The building itself is a magnificent structure, and can proudly boast to be the second largest administrative building in the world - falling short only to the Pentagon in the USA.   The Palace has an incredibly regal looking balcony from which it was originally intended that Nicolae Ceaușescu would address the Romanian people from - however, a fun trivia fact is that the first person to speak from that balcony was in fact, Michael Jackson, during a tour of Romania! The Palace of the Parliament was also the scene of a very famous Top Gear episode, in which they drove super cars around the basement of the building. Other facts about the building include that it took 20,000 larbourers to complete the building, costing in excess of €3Bn and using only Romanian materials.   In terms of accessibility - the Palace of the Parliament can be accessed from the upper level of the building, with level access and automatic doors to make for smooth entry. Those visiting the Palace do so on an organised tour, and when entering the building from the accessible entrance, you will then meet with your tour party at one of the first points of interest on the tour itself - meaning that you do not miss any of the action. Once inside and on the tour, all aspects of the tour are accessible - with lifts available in order to get from floor to floor.   The Palace of the Parliament is definitely one of the highlights of not only Bucharest but of the whole of Romania. "
6756,"Traditional tea rooms serving lunches, snacks and afternoon teas. The tea rooms are in a fomer mill and the water wheel is still working. There is indoor and outdoor seating."
6757,"Salzburg Austria claims to be a ""Barrier free"" city for disabled and many parts arefully accessible, but not all.  The famous old fortress overlooking the city offers outstanding views of the city and the alps but is totally unaccessable gor wheelchairs and has lots of steps. The mountain railway going up to the fort is fully accesssble and disabled go free. Once up the only accesssble part is a cafe and a virwing area."
6758,Camden is on a number of accessible bus routes and London Overground. The Underground station is not step free.
6759,"Can't praise them too highly - courteous and attentive, sensitive to the needs of wheelchair users and very helpful. All the staff we encountered spoke English and our experience in the restaurant suggested that a solo wheelchair travellerwho,  might find the breakfast buffet a bit tricky to negotiate, would.  be offered appropriate & friendly help."
6760,"This performance was part of the Findhorn Bay Arts Source to Sea programme.  This performance by Oceanallover  entitled 'Ecdysis (in vivo) featured dance, amazing costumes, singing and rap; it was set outdoors in woods.  The performance itself was brilliant and I really enjoyed it; I loved the way that it portrayed the sense of renewal and emergence all very relevant to our world today.  I loved the fusion of electronic, rap and brass music and the costumes and dancer were incredibly beautiful; the singing ethereal and haunting.  The only disappointment was that when I tried to book this event initially, the website stated that it was ' not suitable for wheels of any kind' (see below)."
6761,Very accommodating and happy to help.
6762,"They’re friendly, polite and professional. Can be a slight wait if you visit at busy times."
6763,"Watford Junction Railway Station is where I caught the coach to the studio which is wheelchair accessible, because I was travelling from the Midlands it was extra hassle as the lifts are out of action until February 2020. Would be a lot easier if didn't have to be diverted. There is disabled parking outside the entrance.  To get the bus there was quite a big queue and no seating. They also didn't let wheelchairs on first which meant there was very little turning space to get into the wheelchair space. "
6764,The only lift was broken and I was offered an accessible room on the upper floors or non accessible on ground floor As I only have one leg I opted for ground floor for my 3 night stay but could not access the shower as there was  step up! How can accessible rooms be built on the upper floors - what happens in a fire Also the food choice for dinner was poor - breakfast was good
6765,"Everything was within easy reach and the rooms were accessible.  There are ramps at each exit so where ever you are in the property, those using a wheelchair or who have walking difficulties can easily get outside,"
6766,There is a large accessible toilet which you can access on arrival. Large and the toilet flush is also easy to reach.
6767,All staff appeared happy and Helpfull.
6768,"This hotel is ideal for disabled people. The staff are ultra friendly, anything you ask (and believe me I asked some dumb questions - blame it on my stroke!) is attended to immediately. I was travelling on my own in a wheelchair and I requested a disabled friendly room with a shower and do you know that's exactly what I got."
6769,The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were also really professional.
6770,"Good circulation space, tasty food, reasonably priced. "
6771,"Small but well put together museum, very interesting and worth a look around. Very helpful and friendly staff!"
6772,"As I use a power chair I can't help with with the luggage which left my wife struggling with two sets of luggage until we checked inn.  Signage for toilets and gates was poor but this was definitely not a buas, they were bad for everyone!"
6773,"Very good overall in terms of 'an inclusive feeling.' The St Georges's Hilton was recently built and is very accessible. Any adaptations have been integrated into the overall interior design and so are non obtrusive.  It is a great place to socialise, have lunch and to have business meetings. It is often possible to spot a famous footballer or three ( not only English as well - I spotted Messi once!)  One improvement I would make is to install a 'changing places' facility. See the accessible toilets section below  - the FA are hopefully on the case!"
6774,"My accessible room 310 had an accessible toilet. The grab rails were a little different from home as at the hands they were padded and when I pressed down to get up, the rails would press down a bit, this was extremely comfortable as it took took pressure on the pressing down but also felt safe. There was a telephone in the bathroom.  The communal accessible toilet on the ground floor also had grab rails, but these were static and didn't move when I pushed down. There was an automatic door to enter and exit.  Both accessible toilet areas were spacious and clean with grab rails."
6775,"We walked here, there is about a five minute walk from the castle car park to the gardens."
6776,"The Ladybird is moored at Hartford Marina so there is free parking available, although not many designated disabled spaces. The ground is a little uneven in places between the car park and the mooring, but it is possible to drop off passengers very close to the boat and then park.  We have not used public transport to get to and from the Marina, but it is on a bus route."
6777,Met one member of staff to ask about disabled spaces but he wasn’t very helpful.
6778,"The event I attended was advertised as fully accessible but wasn't. Fortuneately I didn't have to use my mobility scooter on this occasion as I could park outside and the venue is fairly small but for anyone with more severe mobility problems some parts would not have been accessible. This was in part caused by a broken lift but for one part of the display you had to climb a steep, narrow staircase."
6779,Lovely little cafe with nice fresh food. Totally level access throughout.
6780,Always helpful and friendly.
6781,"Disabled toilets available, well labelled, ample space for wheel chair users with support bars. There is tactile and pictorial signage on or near the toilet doors"
6782,"Lovely staff, helpful and friendly."
6783,"There is an outdoor life taking it down to the tour, they ask that you phone in advance of your visit so that they can advise whether the lift is working that day. My only grumble is that my wife had to go down like a member of staff know that we were there."
6784,Disabled parking was easily identified near to the entrance.  Buses to and from the stonehenge from the entrance were wheelchair accessible with ramp.
6785,The accessible loos were easily reached and very clean. There is room for a wheelchair to maneuver but  possibly the floor area is a little small for  large wheelchairs. The toilets were very clean and there are grab bars.
6786,The stand behind the goal had one disabled toilet and there were not enough toilet facilities for all the fans in the stand so some people were abusing the use of the disabled toilet by queuing outside it. The toilet was not well designed because it was very narrow so might make transfers a bit difficult. The facilities at the side of the goal were better but we did not see the toilets.
6787,"The dropped curb is at one end of the pavement furthest from the ramp, but it is well made and easy to use."
6788,Plenty if accessible parking bays all around the front of the building.
6789,"Ground floor music venue (oh joy!) with accessible loo. Not perfect, but ok and has some jolly good bands on."
6790,"The access road is quite steep because of the location but once on the level there is an abundance of parking spaces on level ground adjoining the units. We ate out most evenings and would recommend the food (especially the seafood) at The Ship Inn, Elie; the 19th Hole, Earlsferry; The Crusoe Hotel, Lower Largo; The Upper Largo Hotel; and the Old Manor, Lundin Links. We did not need to use a disabled toilet at any of these hotels, so please check beforehand if one is required.  The Fishing Museum in Anstruther is well worth a visit and 90% wheelchair accessible and the café food good."
6791,CG2014 venues have no on-site parking however for general use in the future thought car parking signage was insufficient.
6792,Excellent made everything so much less stressful really friendly and accommodating.
6793,"This is a handy train station good for travelling to Edinburgh, Glasgow or Stirling. It is particularly well equipped for visually-impaired passengers with tactile and Braille features as well as loud, clear audio announcements."
6794,"The whole venue had level access with no steps throughout. However to get from the room to the hotel you had to go across about 10 metres of gravel, which wasn't too deep. I managed alright in a manual wheelchair."
6795,Great!
6796,Warm and friendly hotel with very good access in the front door and around the hotel. This was made special by the helpfulness of the staff who went out of their way to ensure that we had everything we needed.
6797,"Staff are very friendly, but there's nothing they can do to overcome the access problems.  Would probably be very helpful for those with visual and audio impairment."
6798,"Warm, welcoming, helpful, efficient."
6799,brilliant for private car.......not sure about public transport
6800,"Lots of parking, a shop with space to get round everything even on a scooter and fabulous food. A real winner."
6801,"There are no steps and the inside is very spacious, although it is possible some tables had been removed because of Covid. Even in normal times, however, I think there would be plenty of room for a wheelchair.  As it was so warm the doors were open so I didn't take in what they were like.  There is a lot of outside seating both in front of and behind the pub. While much of this is on grass and therefore not easy with a wheelchair, there is a small paved area near the door."
6802,Tarmac path leads to ramp then usual towpath surface which is generally in good condition.
6803,"Stuff everywhere, hard to get around, several areas not accessible to a wheelchair user, unusable toilet. "
6804,"This corner accessible WC was good for most users having a good mirror and colour contrasting toilet seat, but there were some obvious omissions or mistakes: - door signage was weak and should have been clearer with recognition for people with dementia - the door closer was a little heavy - the flush handle was not to the centre of the room - there wasn't a colostomy shelf, but we were advised that this was being fitted - the walls were reflective as opposed to being contrasting with the rest of the fittings - all guardrails were bright chrome which gave the room a modern look at the expense of functionality (plastic fluted and colour contrasted is advisable)"
6805,"The toilets and shower facilities were easy to locate and very accessible due to level access. The toilet, shower and changing facilities were combined in one cubical which makes self-care and dressing easier if having used the swimming facilities. The shower had a drop down seat directly under the shower and one adjacent to it. There is a grab rail and emergency cord in the shower. The shower has level access and a riser rail bar to adjust the height of the shower. The toilet has a drop down rail on the left and a vertical, static grab rail. To the right their is a horizontal grab rail. The toilet is equipped with an emergency cord and a lumbar padded back rest and the toilet paper is within easy reach. The sink has a vertical hand rail on either side and has no pedestal and is not boxed in. This helps with manoeuvring around and positioning at the sink . There is a lever tap with thermostatic control. "
6806,"Clean and modern bathroom with grab rails. Shower with seat and half height movabe screen, Very clean and modern"
6807,Before booking this hotel for can over night stop I had checked with Premier Inn that the room was accessible. I was told it was.   The room was accessible but the bathroom wasn't. Yes I could get into the bathroom and there were lots of grab rails. But the shower was over the bath.   I am in a wheelchair. There was no way I could use the shower.  We complained at reception but there was no alternative.  Lesson learned - when Premier Inn say a room is accessible check about the bathroom too.
6808,The staff we met were friendly and very helpful. We’d suggest getting in touch for a conversation about your requirements before booking as they were keen to help.
6809,A good and spacious accessible toilet is to be found in the small cottage directly opposite to the Castle.
6810,"Green Park Station is very nearby and is fully step-free, but check before you travel because the lifts at this station are notoriously unreliable.  Many bus routes run up and down Piccadilly.   "
6811,There is no specific disabled doors but disabled people often use the front door which noone else uses
6812,There is no toilet in the bank however there is a wheelchair accessible toilet located in the Asda sore across from the bank  
6813,"Droitwich seemed to be ok, not a lot going for it, but interesting enough for a quick visit. We started by visiting the gardens around the open air lido, (photo 1) very tidy and well maintained with spring flowers just opening up (photo 2) and we found a pleasant little duck pond (3) with fishermen settled in for a long day. Following sat NAV we arrived at what turned out to be the public car park, 3 hours  free for disabled, as not sure at first if this was the car park for small supermarket or for public use.  The way down to St Andrews square looked inviting, (4)  but there was a steep slope to get down, so applied brakes to help my wife hold back the wheelchair. The old sign for Droitwich looked interesting (5) which led past stores to toilets (6)  The disabled seemed to be locked and could not see how to find anyone to get in, but it looked very small, and imagine it would have been very basic anyway (7)  The square looked nice, surrounded by small local shops (8) and we did find a number of coffee shops, (9) so drinks would be easy enough to get hold of. We decided that we wanted to see a bit more of town area, so took the side passage down to Main Street (10) And turning right I was pushed up the hill passing old black and white buildings with quite a character about them (11) although we noticed the town was as most British places are neglected and such a shame to see the old inn falling apart (12). However, it led us to a small side street that promised more (13) and although character here, nothing else was (14), so we returned to the car park, with its real struggle to get up the slope from the square, and gladly left Droitwich behind us."
6814,"Can't comment on parking. The path starts from Balgreen Tram stop, which is also served by Lothian's bus #38. Once through the Paddockholm estate a short walk up Station Road brings you to St John's Road, Corstorphine, from where there are frequent buses back to the city city or westwards (Lothian 12, 26 & 31)"
6815,Very accessible. Even has an accessible loo via the poop deck. No pun intended. 
6816,parking at the door
6817,"This is essentially a place about the First War of Scottish Independence back in 1314.  Robert the Bruce and Edward II fought here, that's what I learnt. But the building is brilliant and the landscape was nice when it was sunny!"
6818,Friendly helpful staff
6819,"Excellent accessibility made this a great day out and despite current Covid conditions there are takeout cafes run very safely, disabled toilets and a brilliant indoor giant greehouse that takes you up to canopy level on an accessible pathway. Outdoor gardens are varied and very well maintained. Butterfly House was closed due to Covid issues when we visited."
6820,"All staff and volunteers (and there are MANY volunteers) were very friendly and welcoming.   It feels very inclusive and like you are part of the bigger event going on. Staff/volunteers chat to you, give you high fives, as well as any information you need."
6821,If you have come to watch the Changing of the Queen’s Life Guard access is good. Simply enter the parade ground from the nearby road and choose your spot to watch from behind the cordoned off area.
6822,A number of accessible buses stop nearby but I used my scooter from the hotel I stayed at a mile or so away. Most of the roads (and indeed sites) within dublin are fully accessible so getting here is no problem. There is a multistorey car park with a number of disabled spaces nearby and there are also numerous parking spaces in surrounding roads.
6823,"By 2019 there will be an U-bahn station very close to the building. The nearest at present is at Alexanderplatz, about 10 minutes level wheel/walk away. Bus 100 stops close to the museum on Unter den Linde. The bus route links many of the major tourist sites in Berlin (e.g. Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag building & zoo) and buses can get very crowded, making life tricky for wheelchair users."
6824,There is a door at the end of the bar signed Toilets. Down a corridor which is just wide enough for the wheelchair is a good disabled toilet with a grab bar and full length mirror. Lever handle taps.
6825,"If you drive to the cathedral, you have to enter the Charging Zone. This is £2 per day and must be paid by 6pm. You can apply for exemption if you are a blue badge holder but we didn't know that in advance.  We parked at Prince Bishop car park. Accessible parking is on level 1 and there are lifts to the street level (S). The lifts weren't huge and my trike is bigger than a normal chair so it was pretty tight. The route up through town was mostly easy, except for the last stretch which was steep and cobbled.  There are buses that go up too but we didn't try that."
6826,"There is one step to get in, but inside the layout is suitable for a large wheelchair to get through, with chairs and tables I think could be moved to accommodate someone's easy access. The tables are solid, and high, and i think would easily fit a person's legs under them.   It is all on one floor.    The menu was offered in writing, but as the menu features Turkish foods, the waiting staff were very happy to talk through what all the options meant.  "
6827,The person that I was to ask for wasn't aware that I was coming and wasn't entirely sure how to operate the paragolfer.  The woman in the shop was  lovely and spoke away to me.
6828,Heavy doors but wide and spacious  once inside.
6829,Toilet had a self closing door which made it more awkward than it had to be. Toilet was right sided transfer with grab rails (navy) around toilet and sink. There was a lowered hook but a giant bin next to toilet in transfer space due to also being a baby changing facility. You'd struggle to fit two people and a wheelchair in this loo. 
6830,"It a smallish toilet, but you will manage, and we even found a shower in there if ever needed."
6831,"Helpful, polite, friendly. "
6832,There are two pay and display car parks to the town centre. Pimlico Street car park is closest with free parking for badge holders in designated bays.   If you need to access mobility equipment shopmobility is located  close to Erewash Museum and there is a car park for members. It is only open Thursday and Saturday (9am to 2:30pm). There is a form to complete to become a member.  Bus stops are either up or down a hill. 
6833,"Easy street car parking, 1/2 mile walk to the stadium. "
6834,"There are plenty of car parks within a small area of the Theatre, All Council run car parks, at decent charges"
6835,"Easy access to many but not all tables, good food, lovely waiter - a good place for wheelchair users to visit, apart from a really disgusting toilet (YUK)"
6836,Staff helpful
6837,Staff were generally pleasant and helpful with questions or requests.
6838,A great designer outlet with much consideration spent on disabled people. From a wheelchair user point of view the outlet is a wheelchair user friendly place.
6839,"Good, in a well thought out wet room"
6840,There is no cost for the park but you have to pay for the parking and it is up to £8 for the day or £5 for 1-2 hours. Our advice to anyone with a wheelchair is to park in the smaller car park rather than the main visitor park.
6841,There is a large wheelchair accessible lift to the first floor cafe
6842,"The front inaccessible due to steps, but there is a side door which is."
6843,"Having grown up loving the annual Festival in Edinburgh it's been upsetting to see barriers to access...changing that takes time and a lot of effort. I LOVE how much is being done. I went to the box office to collect my tickets and they told me clearly where the access lift was and where to go. They also told me to look out for staff members on the way in case I had any trouble...that reassured me it was ok to ask which is always a worry. Teviot is a large University building with lots of space for various performers.  At the entrance there is a huge sign stating where is accessible with wheelchair symbols at the top...all of it can now be accessed. The access lift on outside of building is a short journey and a member of staff made sure we (my daughter and I) were ok. We then went inside and again it was clear where we were to be. We were incredibly early and there's not masses of space for waiting, the corridors are used for those exiting the previous performance and I hate feeling I'm in the way, through a door to one side it was possible to wait until the event before us had been cleared without feeling awkward...phew. The staff manager came through on her way to another location and asked if myself and a mum with a child in a wheelchair were being looked after, I love when people pay attention to that, it shows they want it all to work. Once we could go into the event the performer actually greeted us as we went in, which is quite unusual in my festival experience and again we sat in the space for chair users. Some of these spaces which are not purpose built are quite small and we had to move to let people slide into the row, there was space to do so but it's worth noting. The performance was larger than 'intimate gigs' probably are, there were 36 others with us, but small enough everyone could see the 'stage' and hear what was happening. We saw Eshaan Akbar:Not for Prophet and he was hilarious. I'm often offended by comedians who poke fun at others from disability to religion and although he did pick on religion is was in terms of what HE'S been through rather than moking someone else. I could relate to what he was talking and joking about and when he mentioned impairments I thought I was going to be upset, only to discover he is deaf in his left ear and uses a hearing aid. He covered topics like immigration, parental relationships, growing up, work, and spoke candidly about the importance of finding ones identity in 2017 when the world appears to be losing it's own. I left still smiling and have already spoken to friends to say not only are the venue and staff great at what they do but that things are improving and that the attitude and atmosphere is changing too. It's taken a long time, but it's gathering pace which is exciting to see. I'd have no worries about returning to Teviot for an event and I'm delighted to see that not all comedians take joy in belittling others, a breath of fresh air on all counts I think! "
6844,"The staff here are ridiculously sound. Before I had even found a table, one of the barmen came over to me to say that I could get access to the beer garden through their kitchen. It is near impossible to find an accessible beer garden so this is great news. We had a little bit of trouble finding an easy-to-get-to table that had view of a telly for the World Cup so without a flicker hesitation, they set up a table for us that fulfilled all our needs."
6845,"I visited this cafe bar with my sister & a friend for lunch. It is  Accessible  & wheelchair friendly. All measures for coronavirus restrictions are the in place, 2 metre distancing was in place & we’ll sign posted. Hand sanitiser dispensers were at suitable points when entering & leaving the building & were at the correct height for wheelchair users. All members of staff & customers were wearing face masks appropriately. Hi  I had no concerns visiting this cafe bar."
6846,Spacious. Downstairs wide door. Trombone arm. Raised toilet seat available
6847,"We were picked up at the front door of our hotel from a booked minibus for a very reasonable price. However, it's also possible to get there via public colectivo. The busses were easy to spot and the drivers were very helpful. "
6848,All friendly they were Liverpudlians after all!
6849,Toilets are numerous and easy to access.  Large and clean - the only drawback being that they are somewhat tricky to get into.
6850,Certainly very friendly but service was a little slow and some staff seemed a bit inexperienced when we visited. 
6851,The disabled toilet was clean and spacious ensuring that there is enough room for a wheelchair. It was sign posted well and highlighted. 
6852,"Difficult to access, with steps & no disabled toilet."
6853,"excellent, great disability awareness, even brought up breakfast in bed - as long as you give them notice about your needs, you'll be fine"
6854,"Parking was provided in a makeshift farmers yard which was hard standing, but had no markings. Members of staff had no comprehension of what space wheelchair users need, and ended up blocking vehicles from both wheelchair access, as well as blocking the ability of cars to get out of the car park.  For our visit, it required announcements to the whole arena to get drivers back to vehicles to move them so that customers could leave!  The venue is in a field along a countryside lane that has no pavements, and is 0.5 miles from the nearest main road. Buses in the area are infrequent, on Saturdays there is a bus at 10am, 2pm and 4pm.  On Sundays, four buses operate at 11am, 1pm, 4pm and 6pm but are accessible for a single wheelchair."
6855,Good toilets . Good size.
6856,A member of staff took us along a side street pathway (which was a little bumpy) to the wheelchair accessible entrance to the theatre.
6857,"Tried their best, friendly enough.  Though at one point the rest of the group were asked to move so 'the wheelchair' could get through!"
6858,"There is plenty of disabled parking available, and it's possible (and advisable) to book and pay for this in advance. Discounts are available for blue badge holders. Assistance is available, if needed, to get you from the car to the venue. The car park is a fair distance from the entrance, and there's a road that needs to be crossed. There is also a drop-off area approx. 150m from the main entrance. The O2 can also be accessed by tube and various bus routes as well as via the Thames Clipper. The nearest tube station (North Greenwich) is reportedly fully accessible."
6859,Friendly and helpful
6860,Nice cocktails and lively atmosphere/music https://thechelseadrugstore.ie/
6861,"Not the best accessible loo, but at least there is one.  It's nice and tall and has handrails (thought they were wobbly), not sure you would fit a large electric wheelchair in it."
6862,On Buchanan Street so a short walk from both Glasgow Central and Queen Street stations and near local bus routes as well 
6863,"If you manage to get past the cobbles you're confronted with slightly uneven flagstones that do level out once you're inside. Inside is what you expect from a bar. No lowered surface so you need to perform the usual gymnastic routine to catch the bar staff's eye, or send your friends up. A mix of standing height tables and lower ones. You can manoeuvre ish if it's not too busy, but you're pretty much restricted to one spot or spend your entire night yelling 'excuse me'. One thing to note, a lot of the tables are made up of square tables to form a rectangle - they're too narrow to get your footplates underneath between the table legs. There are true rectanglular tables in the restaurant area worth scoping out if you can.  There's an upstairs area but I didn't spot a lift. "
6864,Staff were welcoming and attentive to any needs we might have.
6865,Car parking is in front of the store with spaces adjacent to the entrance. There are no steps or barriers between the parking area and the front door.  No public transport stops in the area. The shop is on the main road from Aomori to Akira.
6866,"The staff were very helpful. Ramps were waiting when my train arrived for me to get off. Returning later in the day I had to change my times and the booking for assistance. The station staff arranged the change, provided ramps to board, and I was able to catch the earlier train. All done with a smile! Great service ..."
6867,The staff were friendly and extremely helpful.
6868,"There are no step-free stations in the area, and parking is difficult. Quite a lot of buses serve the area immediately around the restaurant."
6869,They were helpful and friendly
6870,We To busy
6871,Spacious enough for turning space for wheelchair and carer.  Disabled toilet identified.  No hoist changing space in any toilet - they are not large enough.  In reception area
6872,Accessible loo available but not used on this visit.
6873,Really helpful and friendly.
6874,No trouble at all getting around with plenty of staff for assistance.
6875,I got some takeaway vegan cinnamon buns from here. Would highly recommend it. Staff were really friendly and we all agreed the buns were very tasty. 
6876,"The main entrance at the front of the restaurant is not step-free. There is a side entrance which is step-free. It's difficult to reach it, because you have to pass between tightly-packed tables and chairs, and a heavily weighted sunshade-base which blocks the way and is too heavy to move. Having got past these obstacles you reach a side-door and you have to press a doorbell to alert staff that you want to come in.   Only the back part of the restaurant is step-free, there is a big step down from there to the front part of the restaurant. The front part is not wheelchair-accessible.   Amazingly, the staff sometimes close off the wheelchair-accessible back part of the restaurant for long periods, which means that no wheelchair user can use the restaurant during those periods."
6877,Access into the store was easy. Once inside the aisles are wide and there's plenty of space. It's bright and light.
6878,A wonderfully accessible property finished to the highest standard 
6879,Everyone tried to understand our English 
6880,"Lovely, friendly and efficient service."
6881,"There is a spacious and comfortable accessible toilet on the 5th floor, adjoining the bar/restaurant. It's very good and there is even a decorative display of beautiful round objects in one corner (see my picture below)."
6882,helpful and polite
6883,Good disabled loo with grab rails and space for carer.
6884,"No parking available but many public transport options including bus, train and subway very near by. "
6885,"Open plan layout and spacious feel, with a wide, automatic door at the entrance for wheelchair users. At the moment Silverburn is all on one level, (I think they are currently expanding, so that may change in the future). Some of the larger shops like H&M and Debenhams are on two floors, but they have easy to access lifts."
6886,There isn't any dedicated parking but there is some on street parking on single yellow lines for disabled badge holders - we parked just outside the cafe on a single yellow line.  There are also buses that stop nearby.
6887,There's an accessible loo on the first floor.
6888,"The entrance to the shop is step-free but within the shop the aisles are so narrow, and there are so many rickety display units crammed between the fixed display units, that it's practically impossible to get around to hunt for whatever you want to buy. I nearly accidentally demolished a couple of display units with my powerchair. This layout is all very thoughtless and silly, and wheelchair users certainly haven't been taken into account."
6889,Warm and welcoming. Couldn't have been better.
6890,"If you cannot climb into a bath to have a shower or if you cannot go up uneven steep stairs to access the only walk in shower, DO NOT stay at Steppes Farm Cottages  if you expect a shower.  Oh and if you do decide to go better keep some of the old one pounds to operate the electricity meter"
6891,"There is a car park called St David’s very close to the Hall, it has a whole floor dedicated to disabled and mother and child parking. Because this is in Cardiff there is a train station and buses, plenty of taxis so it has a good network of public transport and accessing the venue is not difficult."
6892,Nice & clean. A little difficult to open door to get out.
6893,"From Waverley Station straight to Manchester Airport there were no issues, the Trans Pennine Service had ample Disabled Access seating, close to a well appointed toilet. Living in Edinburgh we had no parking issues at the Station."
6894,"Oldway Mansion was built for Issac Singer, founder of the Singer Sewing Machine Company.  There is free admission to the gardens, which are beautifully laid out in an Italian style. There are steps and terraces but there are step free routes, although this is not signposted.  The house is closed to the public. It's very ornate. It was remodelled by Paris, Issac's son, in the style of the Palace of Versailles. Sadly it is on the Victorian Society's 2018 Top 10 Endangered Buildings List."
6895,It's close to the train station but a long steep hill from the nearest parking.
6896,Did the job. No red cord or space to turn around so had to rev reverse out. Bin in the way of transferring.
6897,"Very Accessible Hotel, wheelchair Lift at front entrance, very good security and Lift access and accessible rooms"
6898,In the KFC Doncaster there are ramps for wheelchair users to access the venue. There is disabled toilets and changing facilities inside. The counter where you pay and receive your food was high and not wheelchair friendly. The tables have chairs that can not be moved so would be difficult for wheelchair users to sit at the table unless they sat in the aisle.
6899,On this  occasion I travelled by car there is a car park situated just behind the main shops in Kilwinning and also accessible parking spaces on Kilwinning High Street itself.
6900,There is space for 8 blue badge holders. The blue badge disabled parking spaces are in 2 sets of 4 but are unmarked and therefore you have to hope the other cars are parked sensibly. If you are in a wheelchair you need to ensure you have access to the short sections of dropped curb within each of the 4 bay areas. This is the reason for only 3.5 stars as it would be so easy to have dropped curbs across all 8 spaces.
6901,"Not five but *six* stars for staff - they are keen to assist in any way, and are always friendly, nothing is too much trouble. Brilliant."
6902,"The Aquatics Centre is advertised as being ""the most technologically advanced and stunning swimming facility in the World"". That may well be true if you are a swimmer - though Blue Badge users will face a long trek to the facilities - but if you are a wheelchair-using spectator then you will often find better provision in much older venues. As a local with free tickets we still enjoyed the event, but would have been very disappointed if we'd paid and/or travelled further."
6903,"There is no on-site parking as it's located on a pedestrianised precinct but it's only a few minutes walk from parking in the Eastgate Centre nearby; it's also a few minutes walk from the train and bus stations. On-street parking is a bit further away and it can difficult to get a disabled space, especially at the time of day when I visited."
6904,"They bend over backwards for everyone, not just me! The owner is always floating around, checking up on the customers, chivvying up the staff."
6905,Some are very helpful but others could do with more disability awareness training.
6906,The staff are friendly and regularly visit the table to check up on customers as to how their meal is and whether they would like anything else. I trust that they would quite happily cater to the needs of any of their customers and would be helpful in general.
6907,Level access entry and lifts to take you to all floors. The accessible bathroom is spacious but has a bath.
6908,Great food at affordable prices with friendly and helpful staff.
6909,"The Gielgud is one of London's older most accessible theatres. This was my second visit in a power chair and the access and staff could not be faulted. Its unusual to be able to go to a London Theatre in a power chair but there was plenty of space and the view from my chair was not bad ! This theatre also treats disabled visitors in style with a dedicated member of staff available to show you to your seating area, the toilets and comes immediately at the interval and end of the show to assist you. Such a relaxing experience. "
6910,"Been a great experience at Glasgow Central Station, the network rail staff are brilliant, never had any major issues with them "
6911,"Ther is none on site, it is what parking you can find within Windsor eg normal car parks and just park."
6912,"We only saw ordinary men’s and ladies toilets, no disabled seen, and needed a long ride to reach them. I needed help to get back up a steep long ramp however, but Willing staff on hand as passing. I did not see grab rails or pull cords in the area of the hotel I was in "
6913,"Riding on a steam train is a special and unforgettable experience. The train is accessed via a ramp in to the guard's van. There are windows in the gusrds van and a small bench seat so that if your wheelchair is too large to fit through the carriage doorway inbto the disabled space on the carriage, you can travel with two companions in the guard's van. Our wheelchair user in his pwerchair was just able to get through into the carriage. There is a Carer's ticket scheme so that a wheelchair user's companion goes free. The staff are mostly volunteers and we were made to feel very welcome. I understand that a Lottery grant will enable them not only to carry out repairs to the line, but also some is earmarked for improvements to the accessibility of the railway. Have a look at their website for more information https://www.nymr.co.uk/ or phone them in advance (which is what we did)."
6914,The Royal Yacht Britannia get ten out of ten for the amount of thought and planning that has obviously gone into creating the visitor experience. The staff are very friendly and helpful and this contributes greatly to the experience.
6915,"Staff were extremely attentive and helpful.  We were shown to our table, which was socially distanced from the next table.  My carer was politely asked to move my wheelchair to ensure the table was 2 metres from the next one. Drinks order was taken when we were given the menu.  Specials were explained.  We were given adequate time to choose our meals. The plates were cleared shortly after we had finished and the dessert arrived promptly, however, we didn't feel as if we were being rushed."
6916,staff are friendly and welcoming
6917,"Ballare's main entrance is up a massive flight of stairs however for wheelchair users, the entrance is via a side door to the bottom right of the stairs - there is then a lift to take you up to the club. You will need to definitely ring in advance so they can send a bouncer downstairs to let you in. Once inside, the club is flat, spacious and easy to get around. The bar is a little high though, so if you are accompanied by a friend, they may need to get the drinks!"
6918,The accessible bathroom in my room was excellent. There was an accessible loo in the public area but I didn't use it.
6919,The restaurant is on a padestrianised street with buses and trams stopping close by.
6920,I had minimum staff interaction while I was there but the staff at the entrance and in the café where very friendly and helpful.
6921,Access very straightforward for our party which included a powerchair user. There's a large lift that takes you up to higher levels. We only visited the first floor and there was a good sized accessible loo there. Very friendly and helpful staff.
6922,"The hotel was booked for an overnight stay to avoid the M25 on the day of a flight. It was easy to find, mostly easy to get into and the room was great. No aircraft noise in our room. Perfect wet room."
6923,Very helpful staff including a welcoming person before the ticket office who can answer any questions.
6924,All staff members are very helpful. Any request I had was answered with a very friendly tone and the library had an overall calming and friendly atmosphere.
6925,The G & V has an underground car park served by the lifts. Parking in this area is by prior arrangement.  Plenty of local buses and tour buses pass by the door and along the George IV bridge as well as the Royal Mile.   Taxis can drop off and pick up guests outside the front door. The hotel is a ten-minute journey from the Waverley railway station.
6926,Limited inside the castle and tearoom v small. Good grounds in the main. Parking ok but gravel paths in some places. 
6927,"Dawlish Railway Station runs parallel to the sea wall walk and next to the station there is a step free access to the sea wall. The station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. There are also local, step free buses that stop nearby. At the end of the walk there is Dawlish Warren Station, which has step free access but the station is unstaffed. There are also step free buses from Dawlish Warren."
6928,Please see main review 
6929,"Excellent and efficient staffing ,recognised my symbol cane and offered service and support throughout to our next boarding point to Astana."
6930,"Access was fine, via a lift to get to the foyer, and after that you were able to get to all levels by lift. "
6931,"Although did not require staff assistance I am confident, if needed, the staff would be extremely helpful."
6932,Clean and spacious - the loo itself was in the corner so you would have had to transfer one way.
6933,Wheelchair accessible  venue with provision for accompanying carers and dedicated booing hotline for special access requirements.
6934,"The centre can be accessed from the main road by a slope leading from the pavement and there are stairs and a sloped pavement leading from the carpark to the main entrance.   The building itself has a very distinctive shape so is easy to spot (see pictures).   Inside the centre there is a lift to access other levels, there is a Hearing Loop, and a Lowered Counter at the main reception, the gym has specilised equipment for wheelchair users to access and slopes to reach the pool side however there is no pool side Hoist.   The centre hosts a number of disability friendly groups on different days."
6935,I used the number 22 Lothian Bus which takes you right outside Ocean Terminal.
6936,"There were plenty of staff around at points throughout the exhibition.   They were friendly , helpful, and happy to answer any questions, however they also didn't 'get in the way' of just being able to be, and enjoy the experience. "
6937,Level access into the bar and you can also go down the side of the building from the main road into the green area. There is lots of seating to choose from but still enough space to move around outside. Some nights they have BBQ and music playing.
6938,Signage at entrance was fine - good size & very clear . It didnt have automatic doors. There was a flight of stairs but unfortunately they were not clear.
6939,Very attentive and welcoming theatre staff. Made our trip!
6940,"The Library has been adapted wherever possible, a platform lift from the main entrance to reception is available. From the reception there is wheelchair access around the galleries on the ground floor and accessible toilets. There is also a platform lift that takes visitors to the Wolfson gallery on the first floor."
6941,"As the toilets were in part of the courtyard and our show only lasted 1 hour, I did not use the facilities and so am unable to comment on them. "
6942,Staff generally happy to help with info and with heavy internal doors.
6943,There is on street parking at the sides of the cinema and a sizeable car park across the road so it is easy to get to by car
6944,Changing places toilet available. Fitted with hoists etc. Wonderful facility but on my second trip it was in dire need of cleaning. No sign of a checklist for cleaning and didn't know who to report to.
6945,1 radar key toilet by the Cathedral. Large enough but poorly lit and with minimal aids and not very clean.
6946,staff on hand to assist with disabled entrance into the pool - still able to swim!
6947,"The staff are some of the friendliest and helpful staff I have ever come across, nothing is too much trouble for them, this is across the board including security, bar staff, entertainment and so on. The park has two toilet and shower blocks, one on each touring field. Each block has disabled access showers, toilets and washing up area and run on the national RADAR key system. Enjoyed fishing, facilities are suitable for disabled anglers, with parking close to the lakes."
6948,I have visited Loudons a couple times before but on this occassion I used the toilet facilities so feel I could give a stronger review.
6949,The cottage itself was spacious and had the most exquisite outdoor area. Which we we lucky enough to use a lot.  Also the locals were super welcoming too for wheelchair access. 
6950,The staff were great making sure we were on the right platform and taking us to the lifts as well as opening the barriers for us.
6951,Reasonably accessible gym and pool with disabled loos and an accessible changing place for swimming. 
6952,"Unfortunately due to the size and layout of the building their toilets are downstairs, this personally doesn’t present a problem as I don’t often need an accessible toilet "
6953,Disabled parking is limited. I4 & Indigo trent barton stop near by.
6954,"Step free access, if booked booked throuh dmt accessibility line. "
6955,The cafe is wheelchair accessible and the staff are always very welcoming. The serve delicious lunches and coffee and there cakes are also nice. They have a disabled bathroom which is perfectly adequate. If you are a fan of chocolate they have their own chocolatier upstairs and make a huge range of yummy chocolates. Try one of the hot chocolates........ you won't regret it!! 
6956,"Disabled toilet and very easy to find as is located beside male and female toilets. Plenty of space to manoeuvre and for an extra person if needed. Grab rails included, along with an alarm cord."
6957,"We visited the garden, cafe and shop encouraged by previous very helpful reviews. Most of the site is excellent but as a previous reviewer has noted some gravel areas let it down."
6958,"plenty of space to get in/out of wheelchair taxi, disabled parking too."
6959,"Given the age of the building, access was always going to be difficult. That said the attitude of the people running it makes all the difference, and the public areas address fully accessible, including the restaurant and bar. Food and location lovely."
6960,I only used one loo and that was impressive even having a ceiling hoist.
6961,Ground floor is fully accessible. Accessible loo and plenty of space between tables to get through. They also cater well for allergies and are really allergy aware. The tables aren’t easy to get knees under when using a powerchair. 
6962,All staff were very friendly and helpful. Box office staff always willing to find seats with best view of interpreter or captions. Sophie can sign fluently meaning that there is someone working front of house who can communicate with Deaf visitors. 
6963,"There was a lift at Morecambe FC, The lift was lift was large and very spacious, I was able to press the buttons by myself.  "
6964,David and Felicity were excellent hosts who responded warmly to any queries and gave us a full tour of the cabin when we arrived.
6965,"I couldn't walk past this shop without going inside. A window display full of cakes and pastries, and an inviting step-free entrance with the door propped wide open. There were no regrets - Fisher and Donaldson is an absolute delight. "
6966,"The shops are laid out in a semi circle formation and access to them is directly from the ground floor.  However once inside, many of the shops are over 2 floors."
6967,Entry by front if in a wheelchair.  Parking at rear.  
6968,plenty of access in this store to get around and choose your candy
6969,"Completely wheelchair accessible, though a bit tight for wheelchairs in places but helpful staff and good food"
6970,So much better now they have a lift. The store needs to keep an eye on the aisles. Wide enough but sometimes the way merchandise is displayed creates barriers. 
6971,"Good lift, difficult internal doors"
6972,There are some disabled parking bays in Cambridge street just opposite the entrance
6973,There was a ramp to use to access the path to the entrance.
6974,We were staying in Southbank so it was a walk/wheel to Westminster and then the Churchill War Rooms are just round the corner. Westminster is an accessible tube station with the Jubilee line. There is plenty of public transport nearby. There are also plenty of tourists so sometimes you can't get about as quickly as you would wish!
6975,The staff couldn't have been more helpful and were apologetic about the platform lift being out of order.
6976,we traveled by bus ....that had a lift to get t.
6977,"Regular spacious multiuse toilet, "
6978,"Having had numerous difficult journey's with other British Airports Assistance Service's it was a relief to travel with Bristol for the first time. The desk is easy to find, they had a clear record of the booking. Helped with the bag drop, security was a calm experience and helpful with the chairs and directions clear about where to sit to wait air side. Even better the waiting area is next to their control room so even though the ambulift was late due to another flight holding it up they were able to come and reassure us that we hadn't been forgotten. This assistance for two wheelchair users was booked via TUI whose Welfare Team were also excellent. The only reason I have given 4 not 5 stars is the steep-ness of the airport site for wheelchair users, but they have done the best with the terrain they have."
6979,"Poor access, no lifts or ramps and a lotof stairs. Onlt 1 doorman so they could not help. I went in my manual wheelchair with a group of friends, luckily I don’t weigh a whole lot so one carried me and another carried my chair in! If it had been really busy I wouldn’t have been able to see but the staff said I could go upstairs which is off limits to the public but there was a spiral staircase to access it so we didn’t use it. "
6980,New site yet wheelchair spectating areas for Commonwealth Games were very poor.
6981,"We've had a very different experience to the last reviewer finding the staff to be helpful but providing only the help that's needed/wanted rather than imposing themselves when they weren't needed.  They are essentially Londoners so don't show friendliness to strangers but we lived in London for 30 years so that is what we'd expect.  The first time we went there they were keen to help as much as we needed but once we made it clear we only needed help with ramps and automatic gates and were capable of requesting ramp assistance once we got to the platform they were happy just to let us get on with it.  The only problems we've had were to do with lack of knowledge by extra staff taken on for busy periods not knowing that the last couple of carriages including one with wheelchair spaces don't fit on the platform so we've had to walk most of the length of the train at the last minute to reach the other wheelchair spaces.  We've never had any problems here with staff not meeting the train with ramps, which can't be said for Waterloo or Paddington which would be our alternatives."
6982,"Disabled toilet was hard to find, signs weren't totally clear. The bathroom was too small, there wasn't a bin and needed more work doing as TLC."
6983,No parking and on road parking is a nightmare. Very close to a bus stop.
6984,Nice clean accessible toilet
6985,"Todays Spa’s are becoming more and more popular, and this Spa is highly  recommended by us, it has everything you need, and just looking at our photos will show you what we mean, but there is a lot more to this Spa than we can show you today.  The park has one of the top best Spa’s, which features 8 pools, with soft gentle relaxing music played to coax that feeling of well being, and as you look around at  what is available you will see that this is truly a first class Spa. For a start off it has two inviting swimming pools, the heated indoor pool is for adults only, with loungers and beach chairs to help you relax in its quiet pleasant surroundings, while the outdoor Heated pool invites all ages to come and enjoy the facilities, which includes a pool bar.  You can also enjoy a spa bath, thermal cabins, award winning treatment rooms, and a modern fitness centre. It is just quite a wonderful experience to see what is available for you, and you will find that they will help and support you all the way, they are encouraging disabled to come and enjoy their facilities, and we really do recommend this as a Spa that all should go and enjoy, words will never be enough praise for Pennyhill Park.  To really see what we mean, then do go to their website where more details and photos can be seen.  OUR REVIEW OF THE SPA AND HEALTH CLUB. The Spa and club has been seperately built away from the main hotel, in a truly delightful setting, and for the disabled we will just point out that if it’s a manual chair you use, then you will need the help of your carer, as it’s uphill on your return to the car park or hotel itself, but don’t miss the chance to see what can be done by people who care for others.  Alongside the main hotel car park by the main entrance, an intriguing village like setting invites you to come and see what it’s all about (photo 1) and the archway calls you on to explore what lies ahead (photo 2). There is a downhill slope ahead (3) that may call for your brakes to be applied to save your chair running away with you, and this will help your carer anyway.  (It would be wonderful if management could ever consider laying down a disabled bay down by the Spa entrance via the path, so that disabled could drive down and thus enjoy this magnificent Health club.)  The entrance to the Spa has a number of steps that may concern you (4) but there is a wide path available that runs over to the left (5) and this will take you along to a pull handle door to get you inside the Spa (6). The passage ahead is very nicely decorated in subdued colours and furnishings. (photo 7) that guides you to the reception desk (8) and the very friendly staff who await to guide and support you. Just explain that you have been encouraged to come and see what is available here, and ask if you may be shown their facilities. It’s all on the level on the ground floor, with plenty of seating (9) with inviting views across to the outdoor pool and back towards the main hotel. You will see a lift awaiting to take you down to the lower level (10) and to the most magnificent heated pool that beautifully lies in marbled stoned flooring, (photo 11) with a bubbling jacuzzi that calls you forward (12). The showers alone are wonderfully tiled (13) and the heated tiled loungers are waiting (14) but I don’t  think my husband will manage them, if he  got down I doubt if he will get up again, so let’s move on before he is daft enough to try. A sauna looks more inviting, and oh my, was it hot in there (photo 15) and what impressed him was the amount of different steam rooms that are available (photos 16 and 17) after which you step out and drop into the plunge pool, and that is cold believe me (18) then a quick wash down (19) before stepping outside to the heated swimming pool, with delightful cane furniture to slip into while enjoying your surroundings (20). He took many, many other photos of this magnificent Spa and health club, but can only show you so much, so please go into their website to see more of what a Club should be like.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS. Absolutely divine, this really touches the heart, but as you have thought, expensive, but surely you feel as we do, you get what you pay for. The whole experience of being kindly shown around their facilities by a very helpful, enthusiastic young lady,  was a pleasure, and a place never to be forgotten.  If you live in the area around Ascot and Windsor, or visiting the hotel on a day out or perhaps staying overnight, then do try this wonderful Health club, it’s a memory you will treasure."
6986,"The staff were lovely, but disability awareness was not good. "
6987,"There is level access throughout. The front doors were a bit heavy but manageable. Once you enter there is a rubber floor and there is step free access to the side of the ice rink, where there are plenty of places to watch the action from!"
6988,Staff are friendly and go out of their way to help. Everyone is so proud of their museum and the local connection. It's like they all own a piece and want to share its greatness.  
6989,"I decided that as I live locally it would be a different place to try for a walk, as during covid everywhere is shut. The car park had plenty of spaces for disabled parking and we were pleased the space was more than adequate for our WAV van. Staff were very helpful directing us to where the disabled parking was.  It was a short distance to the ticket booth but the bight was not friendly for a person in a wheelchair which was high up, making it harder to hear and talk. When booking tickets if you have more than one carer you have to email, a shame there is not an option on website.  The grounds were very lovely in January and very accessible in my power wheelchair with good alternative routes with no step access well sign posted.  There were a good amount of ordinary disabled toilets which I could not use but what was brilliant was that they had a changing places toilet near the lake which included a shower, and was lovely and warm. However Leeds castle do call it an adult changing room."
6990,Friendly staff
6991,"Wide aisles, smooth floors, good signage and large lifts are what makes this food store accessible! There are automatic doors at entrances and exits, and step-free access throughout. There are sloped escalators too which feel a bit funny at first - I preferred the elevators! All of the restaurants had plenty of space between the tables, and the chairs were all moveable to allow room for a wheelchair."
6992,"Wheelchair accessible, delicious food and extremely helpful staff will be going back."
6993,"Two large single unisex rooms, handrails around toilet, lever-operated faucets, no changing table or diapering station"
6994,Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at Homelands.  They are very welcoming and friendly and ensure every one feels at home and gets the maximum benefit from their holiday.
6995,Really helpful and welcoming. Provided a wheelchair accessible map and advised on the locations to visit. 
6996,"Staff were so helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.  I wanted to see the penguins being fed but had half hour so we thought we would grab a drink. The cafe near the penguins had just closed, the staff however, took the rest of my team a quick back way to the top floor cafe so they could buy a coffee and a cake then allowed them to bring it down to me so we could all drink it together. We may have missed the feeding if we had made are own way plus for me it would have been all up hill. So kind. This suggestion came from them rather than us."
6997,"Loo fine, but a little on the small side. "
6998,"Lots of toilets throughout centre, well sign posted. Less accessible toilets but all are spacious."
6999,Friendly and helpful.
7000,"Red cord was in the right place, total winner! Toilet was clean and not a storeroom and all facilities worked. Space for transfer and to turn the chair."
7001,There are various toilets located around the centre and there are disabled toilets present at each set. The clean and tidy toilets have lots of space to manoeuvre and have grab rails. There is also enough room for a carer in each.
7002,There were many staff to show the way and all kept a safe distance even opening entry and exit doors.  Meaning I did not have to touch handles etc.  I felt I had minimum contact with surfaces making me feel safe. Lanes were wide and distancing was very clearly marked. The entire facility was in ground level no steps or difucult access in my opinion easy access for all. Also there was a large spacious rest area before exit for people to sit with chairs 2 meters apart for the time anyone needed.
7003,"Along with many other museums and galleries in Spain, the Guggenheim offers specially adapted tours for visually impaired people on days when the museum is closed to the public (Mondays).  Earlier this month I went on one of these as a sighted guide with Travel Eyes, a travel organisation which pairs visually impaired and sighted travellers with each other on a huge range of adventurous and cultural holidays. The touch tour at the Guggenheim was part of a 4 day city break and the cost was included in the holiday so I can't say what this would be, but independent travellers are able to book the tour.  We began with a touch tour around the building - or rather around 3D scale models of the building. Guggenheim Bilbao is housed in a visually striking building, and its construction is very unusual.  We were given an introductory talk about its historic and architectural significance accompanied by small scale 3D models, which really gave the visually impaired visitors an understanding of how the building's appearance. Each element of the museum and the external sculptures were represented in small scale, and we were even given samples of the construction materials to handle - sandstone and titanium. Next we went out into the huge atrium, where the steel skeleton can be seen and felt, and our guide showed where the titanium scales lapped into the building from the outside.  All this before we'd even started on the artworks!  Our guide had chosen exhibits for their tactile, visual and auditory aspects.  Visitors with visual impairments were given latex gloves, and we were then guided inside a huge steel coil and  encouraged to shout at the walls, to listen and feel the echo returning. There was a tunnel of maribou feathers which enveloped us as we walked through, and a huge waterfall of digital light, with streams of words constantly falling - the same words were engraved on a third exhibit nearby.  Our guide spoke only Spanish so you would need a good interpreter, but the only real downside was that the tour only lasts 2 hours. Some of our group returned the following day to visit the rest of the gallery.  The welcome we received and the efforts of the Guggenheim team to meet the needs of visually impaired people, were outstanding.  Nothing was too much trouble. "
7004,"Holland Park is lovely, and has the beautiful Japanese style 'Kyoto Garden'. Wheelchair access is easy in most areas, with just a few areas where only the most intrepid wheelchair users would venture. "
7005,"Friendly, approachable staff and out-of-hours contact details available if assistance is required.  Homelands does not provide carers but can send out a list of local providers for guests to make their own arrangements."
7006,"Arrived in our car, disabled parking space adjacent to the hotel. A little difficulty with the gravel, needing to reverse up to the slabs in front of the doorway."
7007,Hosts could not have been more helpful
7008,There is seating located around the centre at regular intervals. It is mostly all level. Most exits/entrances are on an incline or decline.   There is one lift to level 2 between Starbucks and Poundland (level 2 near TGI Fridays) and a second lift opposite the changing places toilet near Marks & Spencers.   There are only 2 lifts which access level 2 and the signage towards the lifts is terrible so if you don't know where you're going you can end up going round and round looking for the lift. Often 1 of the lifts will be broken too which is frustrating.   There are escalators instead of stairs.  The signs are in a larger print with pictures too.   They do have maps which I find confusing. I've never seen braille or large print maps.   By the looks of it emergency exits are ramped so evacuation chairs are not needed. However the button to release door was really high so looks like you'd need assistance from staff anyway.
7009,Perfectly wheelchair accessible Brilliant staff 
7010,Language was a barrier but they tried to be helpful and were embarassed at the lack of lifts
7011,friendly staff  Accessible throughout  Good loos  Great food and a v nice shop  My mum and dad both of whom have mobility problems were fine there .
7012,13 spaces right next to the doors
7013,Not very helpful.
7014,"There are 2 large, clean accessible loos, on the cafe level and on the ground floor."
7015,"2 toilets on ground floor of the bungalow we stayed in ,one had grap rails etc, other one in a  larger shower room also had rails ,was aclosemat toilet , plenty of room for wheelchair access  . Shower chairs or shower trolley available"
7016,"Tor-na-Coille is the best accessible hotel I've been able to find in the Banchory area.  It's not perfect, but it's manageable."
7017,There is lots of room to get around and the tables can be moved.
7018,"If you are worried about access to this widely established chain restaurant please don't be. My father is wheelchair bound currently which meant we required help and proper disability access to it. The staff couldn't have been better with us assuring us in advance that they had a ramp into the restaurant (albeit a mobile ramp).  They helped us out of the taxi and had the ramp awaiting. They could not have been more helpful and indeed respectful. In terms of the food - I'd recommend the steal frites (although I'm pretty sure most guys would go for that anyway). Being thin it's easy to over cook the steak but it was both tender, juicy and served with confidence which was most enjoyable. They have a good selection of food, drinks and access to disabled toilet all of which are very important for disabled people. Although this is a chain and could be discounted very quickly we enjoyed our dinner very much and the staff were very efficient. WELL DONE COTE !!"
7019,"most of the restaurant is accessible, but the single wheelchair parking bay is the furthest from the door on the edge of the road access to the drive through.  a lot worse than this is the joke of a toilet. to access the toilets you have to pull open a heavy fire door into a vestibule little bigger than a wheelchair, inside here are 5 further doors, open any one of these and you cannot open any others apart from the entrance. to open the ""Accessible"" toilet you need a radar key, but the lock is set so you cannot get the key out of the lock while the door is open, so you have the choice of using the toilet while leaving your keys in the outside of the door where anyone can take them or let themselves into the room with you or begging a member of staff to come and let you in, while you go back to the restaurant and wait, then the vestibule is so small you have to juggle everyone's positions to get into the toilet.  when in the room itself it is tiny, not enough room to turn a wheelchair or have someone to help you unless you leave the toilet door wide open, with no privacy, this lack of room is not improved by the inclusion of obtrusive baby changing facilities, my impression of the toilet was that it was a baby changing room that someone said ""Oh, we can push a small wheelchair in here, why not make it an accessible toilet too?""  all in all i would have been more comfortable sitting in a puddle of urine than going through all that!"
7020,"Polite, but not to friendly or helpful. This may be due to COVID restrictions at the moment, it seems they are only accepting guests who are staying overnight,  and we only managed to be allowed permission, rather reluctantly, because we are members of the hotel group.  Or, it may be , ( and hopefully not ) that as a disabled person, we were not really made to feel welcomed, as this is not a disabled friendly hotel, although they have  done their best, and the staff may have felt we would not cope with the many steps.  However, we did not really feel welcomed and it seemed they were pleased to see us go, and that’s sad, so let’s hope it was this COVID that concerned them."
7021,"You can call ahead to request a disabled parking space, but otherwise the nearest parking is on Woodhouse street, which is a 15 minute walk up the hill to get to the university. However there is a bus stop that stops outside the university (and then a few minutes walk to Terrace Bar), or you can take a taxi and ask them to drop you at Clarence Road (near the union).  Buses are regular from the city centre. "
7022,"The whole hotel is accessible, with lifts to all floors. After we checked in, someone appeared to explain the emergency evacuation procedure, which I have never experienced before, but it was good to know."
7023,From the Main road you can drive right up and park right outside entrance.  There are a couple of disabled spaces.  All parking is free.
7024,Entrance to toilets through heavy door.  Accessible toilet could not be inspected as it was occupied at the time I went to check.  Will check again.  Ladies and Gents toilets up three steps.
7025,Very helpful and approachable
7026,There is a disabled toilet but I didn't use the toilet as it was very dirty. 
7027,Very friendly staff and really helpful
7028,Very happy to help and cared well for all guests during our visit.
7029,The toilets are situated directly across from the bar. There is one disabled access toilet which was clean and contained equipment such as grab rails all within wheelchair height and an alarm cord.
7030,There are disabled bays close by and if you are there at quiet times are often free. There is a 37 bus that goes close by but using this will depend on your mobility
7031,"Automatic doors and lifts, wide pathways, enough space in the restaurant."
7032,"accessible shop, staff always helpful, plenty of space only negative is a massively small niggle"
7033,"The parking seemed further away than I'd been led to believe, not sure but maybe blue badge holders could part nearer.  Also was uphill!"
7034,"Very helpful and polite, the presentation was of the standard expected and helped to make the experience very enjoyable. We were able to meet the chef next morning and thank the team for their efforts."
7035,"Easy to find , large size"
7036,"Being familiar with toilet standards, the space is very good and just needs an ostomy shelf. Unfortunately no hoist or adult changing bench. Baby changing is in this space but not intrusive (it's bigger than the UK standard. Clean and low level light."
7037,We came by bus. The restaurant is on the corner of Lothian Road and Princes St so there are many bus options and also a tram stop a few minutes walk away. I am unsure about parking.
7038,Has slightly better access for wheelchairs than the Borrowash branch.
7039,"There is a decent accessible toilet, opened with a RADAR key, and if you don't have one the staff will open it for you. The only problem with this otherwise good toilet is that there's a large bin in the wheelchair transfer area. This is very thoughtless and unhelpful. This area is not free space for storage of large objects like bins. It's the place where wheelchair users park to transfer to the toilet. "
7040,Good level access throughout. The gym had a lot of machines but a limited number for wheelchairs. There was an open area where you could adapt things with the use of bands and free weight etc
7041,The staff were friendly and helpful. They made sure I could get in fine and were very happy to adapt the menu for my dietary needs. They were attentive but not overwhelming. 
7042,The reporter lives right next to the accessible platform.
7043,There's two different entrances so make sure you enter via the step free one on Ingram Street. There is a very funky lift to take you to other floors. It's an old building with fabulous history that has been made accessible so expect a couple of quirky corners etc. dining room upstairs fantastic atmosphere and can rearrange furniture to meet your needs.
7044,There were plenty of accessible features inside this Argos shop in Falkirk's central retail park.
7045,See above
7046,"no steps, good lift disabled toilet, helpful and friendly staff"
7047,Wonderful lodge to stay in.  Nearby cafe/restaurant so personal assistant could have their break and meal on their off duty time
7048,"There is a large car park with spaces for blue badge holders. There is a bus stop within 10 minutes' walk, but no tram stops."
7049,There are a few disabled car parking spaces at the main car park into the zoo.
7050,There is very good access for people with mobility difficulties. There are 3 entrances to the restaurant/ pub. We entered from the corner door which had one shallow step and double doors. Once inside the pub and restaurant area is spacious and it was easy for both of us to walk with our walking sticks. The pub and the other 2 rooms which serve as the restaurant are all on the ground floor and inter connecting. The 2 restaurant rooms are extremely spacious. The tables and chairs are free standing so can be repositioned. We were given the menu but I forgot to ask if they had a large or braille print menu.
7051,Really friendly and helpful. Thanks! 
7052,There is plenty of parking here but because of the scale of the place you will still have to walk about 30 yards to the entrance. I don't know if buses come into the grounds but the driveway when you enter is about half a mile long.
7053,the staff were very helpful.
7054,"An arts centre which offers a wide range of activities; arts & crafts, music (jazz, classical etc) & so on. It is very easiy accessed, with no steps & lift access to the first floor. My review does not include the adjacent Wilde Theatre. The centre is located in  extensive park land, which has good paths."
7055,Imagine doing up the public toilets and forgetting your accessible toilet is for disabled people...  They need a cord but there's nothing there?? No support whatsoever. 
7056,"Getting around as a powerchair user in the Book Festival was incredibly good. Even the spaces and places that you usually don't expect to reach worked well. With matting and shallow ramps to connect the boardwalks to the grass space you were able to enjoy sitting in the sun of the central 'lawn'. The various 'tented' reading areas, the bookshop and the reception and ticket area were all easy to move around in."
7057,I found the staff a bit mixed. Some were very helpful but others a bit impatient and dismissive. 
7058,"All staff very helpful and considerate, go over and above to give consideration and any assistance required"
7059,Parking virtually next to the castle
7060,It’s a pretty smooth route except for the aforementioned tree roots. 
7061,Our farm visit was our second to the farm and I can't recommend the farm and family enough we are a large family with 3 kids of our own and 2 children with disabilities that we Foster and we always have a fantastic time there it's so relaxed and friendly and completely child friendly. The family are so welcoming and kind. It is a very special place to visit 
7062,"Staff were good, apart from ordering drinks didn't really interact with staff but were friendly when we did."
7063,There is disabled parking at a car park about a 5/10 minute walk from the entrance. The issue we had with our group is that if someone isn’t using a wheelchair but struggles with mobility it can be difficult. When we arrived back after the boat trip we brought the cars right outside to pick our group up but it is worth contacting the venue to check this is ok.
7064,There is some disabled parking available at the harbour.
7065,Good access to lots of the ruin and most of the grounds although the high paths are not accessible. Free maps available to show where you can go. Good surface paths if using a wheelchair so pushing isn't too difficult although there are a couple of slopes which seem to last longer than you think they will! Scooters and wheelchairs available for hire. Courtesy vehicle available to got to St Mary's Church and to and from the visitor centre to West Gate.
7066,"At the end of the car park there is level access to the toilet, which is inside the building. There is also a take away kiosk in the same building, though not surprisingly it was closed that day.   It would be nice if there were more seats which were easily accessible to allow those with poor mobility to sit looking at the view. Many are down the hill on the grass."
7067,The website advised not to use the postcode but follow the brown signs.  This we did and got there with no bother.  There was a large car park adjacent to the entrance to the museum site which had a number of disabled bays play an ev charging point.
7068,"This is one of the biggest toilets: its clean, I remember it having a hoist (although I've never used it). It's operated by radar key which, depending on your perspective, may or may not be a plus. I have never had any difficulty using it."
7069,"These gardens are located a little way outside Bury St Edmunds and a re a super place for an afternoon out. The paths are mostly level, either tarmac, grass or bark clippings (so easier for a powered wheelchair than a manual one unless you have a strong pusher! There are bridges over the pond that have been recently restored and are perfectly accessible. In fact there is little of the garden that is inaccessible for a wheelchair user. I think they have recently done some work to improve the accessibility since the garden waas left by its creator to 'Perennial'. There is a good sized accessible toilet, large enought to accommodate wheelchair and carer if necessary. The cafe does tea and coffee and delicious homemade cakes. Highly recommended."
7070,"Cathedral is fully accessible, but access to the tower is only by hundred of steps."
7071,"The museum of fine arts is set in a beautiful late 19th-century villa. The paintings and sculptures on display range from the 14th to the 20th century: Vanloo, Fragonard, Dufy, Chéret, l'Ecole de Barbizon, Le Bronzino and G.A Mossa, Rodin, Carpeaux.  There is no step free access and no accessible toilet.  "
7072,"Great disabled access, they have thought of a lot here to make it accessible"
7073,"Gets five stars despite the fact that the wheelchair entrance is quite a heavy door opening outwards - five stars because staff members rushed to open it. Once inside there’s easy ramped access to reception, the lifts, the atrium and the restaurant. The accessible room was spacious with a well-equipped bathroom. Breakfast was very good. The evening menu wasn’t for us but steak lovers will be well satisfied. The staff at reception and in the restaurant could not have been more helpful. The bed was quite high, but we travel with a patient turner and a folding footstool, so wheelchair girl got in and out OK."
7074,"Restaurant is all on one level, accessed via double doors into the reception and small bar area. Restaurant is relatively spacious, with some tables better than others for wheelchair users, therefore best to notify staff when booking.  One accessible toilet reached via a small hallway near the centre of the restaurant. See pictures.  Car park has two disabled spaces. However they are normal sized spaces, so not ideal if you need transfer space."
7075,"So lovely, smiley and chatty without being insincere "
7076,"The hotel is located on a quiet street and it's step free into the hotel via automatic doors. Immediately inside there is reception, the desk is of standard height. My room was an accessible room on the ground floor and was step free from the road. There is also a step free breakfast room and separate seating area on the ground floor also step free, which has firm chairs and sofas. There is a lift to the other floors, as my room was on the ground floor I didn't use this. The accessible bedroom is opened by a swipe key with a regular door. The bedroom consists of a double bed, bedside tables, with well placed plug sockets just above the tables. There is a desk and firm chair. There is a flat screen TV with BBC News channel in English and a mini bar. In the corridor is a spacious wardrobe with shelving and draws. The safe is located at standing height. There is a slide door into the bathroom. There was a step free walk in shower. This was fitted with 1 grab rail. I was told the floor of the shower had a special non slip coating but I asked for and was provided with a non slip mat. The shower was excellent with both an overhead and hand held shower heads. There is no fixed shower seat and I'm unsure if one is provided on request. The toilet was raised and had a single grab rail fixed to the wall. There was space under the sink.  "
7077,We were allowed to drive up to the door and park alongside the rear of the building. Just opened so maybe designated parking is planned
7078,"On the 16th March 2020 I visited Mcdonalds in Lancaster, I traveled there via the college bus. I noticed when I got there that there was no car parks near by to park your car. The staff there were lovely and their communication was fine. The toilets were alright I liked them. I had something to eat and drink which was nice. I think McDonalds was good and I will be going back again. "
7079,"An accessible toilet, as well as standard toilets are provided in the adjacent Parish Centre. a door from the Cathedral's lobby leads into the Centre which also housed meeting rooms and a cafe.  The accessible toilet is spacious, modern and equipped with the standard range of accessibility features. It is sometimes kept locked and the key is available on request from the cafe counter (you pass by this on the way to the toilets)."
7080,"There are two buildings, the main museum and the Mail Rail, both are in the same road and almost opposite to each other and there is a zebra crossing.  Both buildings are step free and have automatic entrance doors.  The main museum building is accessed by a shallow ramp into a courtyard area where there are tables and chairs and a display of pillar boxes. The main door is automatic and it leads into the shop and café area. Then its straight on to the start of the museum's galleries, which are all on the ground level. At the entrance there are some portable stools. Please be aware that seating inside the galleries is limited. There is a video screen which has benches to sit and watch the films and where there are interactive things to do there are often chairs. However there are no specific seating for people who simply need to rest on their way round, so I'd advise taking a portable stool if you require a seat. We visited on a busy Sunday afternoon and there were a lot of people visiting the galleries. There are lots of things to see and the museum is very interactive, for example you can have your photo taken for you to include it into your own personal stamp, which you can email to yourself, but you have to be at the right angle to do this and it maybe difficult for some disabled people  to participate in this. The lighting in the museum is good overall and display cases and information boards are at varying heights. The Mail Rail is only accessible for people who meet their evacuation procedures requirements, so I was unable to go on it. In the Mail Rail building there is a shop on the ground floor. The lower ground floor is accessible by a platform lift or staircase with hand railings. On the lower ground floor is the mail rail, an exhibition gallery and video footage area. The exhibition gallery related to the Mail Rail and transporting of letters and parcels.  Please be aware that the Travelling Post Office, which is a reconstruction of a railway carriage may start to move. When I visited there were no notices warning of this. I went inside and it was stationary. I then noticed that the floor started to move from side to side and I very nearly lost my balance. Speaking to staff I was informed that the floor is stationary until someone picks up one of the letters and puts it in one of the holds and that then triggers the floor to move. I asked if signs could be put up at both entrances to it, to warn people about the floor's movement and I was told they would arrange this.  At the far end of the exhibition gallery there is an area , which had red and white chevron signs and no other signposting. I think this is because most people will go on Mail Rail and then it will be the first thing they see when they exit the train. I only knew it was there because I had been online and read bout it and asked a member of staff where it was. In this area is the Accessible Rail Mail Show. When I first realised  due to my disability that I would not be allowed on the Mail Rail, I was pleased to read that they have a video show for people who can or don't want to ride the train. This is a very personal view, but I assumed the video was footage of the entire train journey so one could get as close as possible to knowing what it was like riding the train. However the video cuts between footage of the train ride and historical information. I felt this was more geared towards providing additional information to people who had already been on the train rather than for people who couldn't ride the train. I was already feeling disappointed that I was unable to ride the train with my friends, and then felt further excluded by not getting a real sense of what riding the train felt like. The Accessible Rail Mail Show has tip up seats, like in theatres, which means that wheelchair users can also access the space. There are subtitles for the video show and audio is accessed by head phones which are at the back of the chairs. "
7081,"A lovely natural country lane drive through 2000 acres of open garden views created by Capability Brown, and beautiful scenic views leads you towards the gracious Tudor house of Fawsley  Hall Hotel and Spa, (photo 1). A pleasant gated driveway (photo 2) takes you towards the Hotel, (photo 3). The disabled parking bays are at the rear of the hotel, some distance away from hotels entrance and only two bays available (photo 4), so if it is raining you are going to get very wet. The entrance to hotel (photo 5) is very inviting, but there is a step to get up (photo 6)  and although this is a reasonably low step, we could not manage it without my getting out of the chair, to allow my wife  to pick it up over the step.  Once inside the hotel, we were greeted at reception and escorted into the pleasant courtyard lounge area, and a very comfortable and relaxing area (photo 7)  to enjoy our brandy and coffee afternoon tipple (photo 8).  There is a nice little terrace courtyard to sit in, but rather a high step to get into it, (photo 9) so it was not suitable for a wheelchair, unless you can get out of your chair. The courtyard now leads towards the bar and restaurant, (photo 10) but a number of steps prevented us from using this entrance, so we made our way around on the level to pass the reception area, and down an easy little ramp into the Great Hall ( photo 11). This was quite an attractive room, nicely furnished, but for us it didn’t have the wow factor. (photo 12).  Now, along a level passageway (photo 13) it lead us to the elegant Cedar restaurant, (Photo 14) and we noticed plenty of spaces we would be able to leave our wheelchair in to enjoy evening dinner.  Then you may exit the restaurant via a passageway (photo 15) that leads to the staircase for the bedrooms (photo 16) However, this is a listed building, so no lifts are available throughout the hotel, but we believe there are two bedrooms on the ground floor, but we do not know if these are for disabled use. Not far from reception we found the disabled toilet (photo 17)  and although on the level to reach this area, it was almost impossible to get the Wheelchair into the toilet, so it had to be left outside on corridor. The toilet itself was quite impractical for a disabled person (photo 18) unless you can walk a few steps.  We are afraid that you will have to miss the delightful Bar (photo 19) as there are to many steps to get up and we feel you may already be tired now having faced other steps, I know it wore myself out.  Finally exiting the hotel, you have to get down that step, to return round to the car park (photo 20) on a level path, passing garden areas.  Our final thoughts. This gracious 5* Tudor house hotel is well worth visiting, if you have some mobility, but sadly, this is not a disabled friendly hotel, even though they have done their best, and we cannot recommend this hotel for the disabled."
7082,"No steps, wide doors, wet room, sink in bathroom can be raised or lowered, bedroom lights by touch rather than switches. Many disabled accessories available, list provided when booking."
7083,Easy accessible by pubic transport.
7084,Good size and clean!
7085,This was really accessible and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. 
7086,Staff were friendly and courteous.
7087,Loads of buses and taxis pass along Old Street and there's a tube station not too far away (not wheelchair accessible at the time of writing).
7088,Fully accessible spacious disabled toilet on the lower ground.
7089,I visited Culmore Country Park today. It had the most beautiful wild meadows and stunning views as far as Donegal. The whole site is fully wheelchair accessible. I use a tilt and recline power wheelchair aka my Freedom Wheels and there was plenty of room for me and my chair and my friend walking beside. 
7090,Very attentive and keen to help.
7091,There were no staff there on this occasion when we visited as the visitor centre was closed hopefully as this is re-staffed again they will perhaps be more volunteers on the site of the abbey to tell people more about its history as I think that would be very interesting
7092,Staff were awesome. Very helpful and cheery. Happy to chat to you if you wanted.
7093,"It is level access into each house at Homelands and the doors are wide enough for wheelchair users to get through. When you first come through the front door you come into a spacious vestibule area where you are able to store shoes and jackets if you wish. You then come into the main area of the house where the kitchen and living room is, this was a nice open spaced area. I found the kitchen very spacious to move around in. I’m not able to cook anything myself so, I don’t need to be able to use the cooker, microwave or sink. However, some visitors may be able to and would struggle due to nothing being height adujustable. There was a worktop near the end of kitchen though was at a great height for my wheelchair. The dining table was also a great height for my wheelchair and plenty of space for 8 people to sit around it. Again the living room was spacious for wheelchair user to drive around, especially with being joint on to the kitchen. I would say the only trouble I had in the living room area was that I kept pulling up the rug that was underneath the coffee table with the wheels of my powerchair. I know it’s to add to the nicely decorated house but, I feel wheelchairs and rugs just don’t go together. Beside the kitchen and living room area there is also a corridor leading to the ground floor bedrooms and toilets, and a staircase leading upstairs.  As a non-mobile wheelchair user I was unable to go upstairs to see what it was like. There was 2 bedrooms though that slept 2 people each and a bathroom shared between the 2 bedrooms. My mum was a little disappointed though that her bedroom upstairs was the only bedroom that didn’t have a wardrobe. She had to share her friends wardrobe, who was in the other bedroom upstairs.  On the ground level of Homelands both bedrooms have a H shaped tracking hoist which covers the whole room. There are 2 single beds in each room, 1 of them is an electric adjustable bed with a profiling mattress. Having an adjustable bed was great due to needing assistance from my helper, the other bed was just a standard bed. My bedroom was the biggest room at Drummochy and I found there was plenty of storage for all my things, especially in the wardrobe. There were also plenty of plugs in the bedroom for my equipment, specifically beside the bed. Beside the window in the room there was a door leading out to the garden. The only problem was we couldn’t figure out how to lock the door, I’m not sure if it was broken or if we just didn’t know what to do. It was a glorious weekend weather wise so it was really warm, at night I found it roasting and couldn’t figure out how to turn down the heating in my bedroom.  Due to it being a sunny weekend we were able to enjoy the beautiful gardens throughout our stay. It was level access out to the garden from the living room, there are double doors to get outside and there are door stoppers available to keep them open. There was a lovely patio areabeside the doors with a small BBQ and a table that seats 8 people. The garden is shared between all of the 4 houses."
7094,"Access throughout - café, deli, accessible toilets and plenty of parking"
7095,"very clean accessable loo, could do with 2 because of the 20 minute recess in the middle of the show, there is no hoist but plenty of room to manouver a stand aid if need be, the only problem is that people without disabilities seem to use it instead of going to the loo upstairs"
7096,"We walked here, but there is a long drive up to the castle up a grand driveway - I think there's accessible parking spaces."
7097,There was disabled parking but not much of it.
7098,Loads of buses on this street which is really handy. Can't say much about parking as I don't have a car. I walked here from the Pleasance Courtyard where I had been watching other shows.
7099,Wheelchair accessible although a bit of a squeeze getting in and out with a power chair but definetely doable. Disabled toilet. Great food. Friendly staff
7100,"There is a public disabled toilet for you, close to reception entry, very clean and nicely tiled out, with grab rail, and if you have to, you could get a wheelchair inside."
7101,Staff were friendly  although not always knowledgeable. When we asked a staff member were there any disabled loos she did not know.
7102,There are no steps in but there is a manual door.
7103,"There is no parking at the hotel there is a car par across the road that has Blue badge spaces however there is restrictions in place 3 hour time limit.  There is a bus stop across the road used by local buses, This is also a one way street"
7104,Staff were extremely helpful and friendly.
7105,"The gardens have steep access from Princes street, but you can enter via the lifts within the National Gallery and the Academy. These take you to the Garden Café and out to the gardens. Much less hassle."
7106,"We walked from the dam, but there is a large car park about 50 mins away from the centre. "
7107,Accessible Toilets are available but I haven’t needed to use them on any of my visits. 
7108,"There is a lift, ramps, including into interactive areas and displays. There are foldable seats you can borrow too."
7109,"By the entrance there are 2 zebra crossings, one directly opposite the entrance and the other at the corner of the road, neither of which had a drop kerb. The entrance to the gardens is either via a slope or steps and there is a small permanent  at the entrance gate. The ticket booth is at standing height.  I was given a map when I arrived. It marks off the main features and plants and trees. No accessible route is marked off and it was not clear from the map where there were stairs. The area immediately by the entrance is level. However there are then a few steps to the upper level. However for a step free route make towards the toilets and follow the the path where G is on (see photo of map). Then the only other place where there are steps are at the far end of the garden where the water gardens is (marked as F on the map). Apart from the steps near the entrance the rest of the garden has a gentle slope.  The paths are gravel and in several places the tree roots cross the path, some of them are signposted but it meant that I couldn't properly relax as i walked around as I kept having to watch where I was walking.  The gardens are very beautiful but they are not especially large, so distance wise it is very managable but lots to see."
7110,There are two wheelchair accessible toilets one is located in the main building the other is at the other end of the station near the area the coach tour holiday leave from. Both were good basic accessible toilets and were clean. Radar Key needed for both
7111,"Full marks to all the staff for being helpful and friendly - except those who maintain the accessible toilets, who should know better than to   - tie up the red emergency cord in the basement's accessible toilet - maintain a red emergency cord which is too short in the 3rd floor accessible toilet - block the wheelchair transfer space in the basement accessible toilet  with a big bin - discriminate against disabled people by keeping the 3rd floor accessible toilet locked  "
7112,"The entrance to the club is at street level however the music and bar are underground. If your wheelchair is of average size, Fez do have a lift to take you down to the club itself. However, please note that the lift is often out of order so I would recommend phoning in advance of your visit."
7113,David Glover and his team of volunteers are very helpful and patient. They are able to pair the person with a bike or 2 to try out and see what individuals prefer. 
7114,There are several blue badge holder spaces adjacent to the Visitor Centre. 
7115,These are Christmas lights with a difference! Fun to go and see the show. Was very busy but you can see from wherever you are - try and get in the middle of the arches for the best experience. Step free but it is on the Royal Mile so there is an abundance of cobbles. It's free but you have to book in advance.
7116,"We were given a map & a day planner when we arrived which had logos for accessible toilets (I counted 5), baby changing, restaurant, rain shelter etc & couple of places that had restricted wheelchair access. Good signage around the venue. Plenty of places to wash your hands (notices to say that animals carry disease) The large cafe was accessible with seats inside & outside. Friendly, helpful staff."
7117,Back door level access
7118,Plenty of disabled spaces in car park. Close to the train station.
7119,"Access onto the station is good, also into the shop and cafe are all on one level. There is a ramp onto the train with a member of staff to assist. The only problem is the 10 minute walk to the museum. The start of the path at the station end is pretty uneven  with stones. It is a cinder path thereafter and pretty flat but prone to puddles in wet weather. "
7120,Throughout the whole building disabled access is okay but not the best. 
7121,"Not actually staff, but the owners,  a couple called Jan and Willie are wonderful.  Really nice, friendly and helpful."
7122,"Plenty, roomy parking spaces outside the lodges."
7123,The box office staff where very helpful both on the phone and in person although I wish I could of specified tickets in 105 rather than where we ended up sitting.  Staff on the lifts and security where very nice and we were directed towards the correct queue and direction in which our seats where located. The member of staff in the seating area was helpful in suggesting for us to seat behind where we were initially positioned but when I thanked her for her assistance she just grunted as though it was an inconvenience for us to have asked to move.
7124,"All shops, cafes, reastaurants, bars etc had good wheelchair access. The Roman theatre was a climb but parts of it had been exposed at street level and one could access the stage of the Roman amphitheater by wheelchair. "
7125,"Toilet on each floor, plus accessible showers. Wide doors and pull chords."
7126,No parking in the immediate area.
7127,All parking is free with ample room for minibus parking
7128,"Three disabled loos with three disabled showers. No pull cords, though: stipulation of being supervised."
7129,Really helpful. Security staff are great and hold doors open when they see you approaching. They also help where they can with the aforementioned lift. Hospitality staff were also great.
7130,Very helpful and friendly. 
7131,"Helen and her husband were very welcoming.  On our arrival she came around to explain the working of the height adjustable bed, and answer any other questions we had.  The home-made scones that were awaiting us on arrival, went down a treat."
7132,Arriving at Fort George you are left with an air of uncertainty as you sweep in to the lightly gravelled car park. A solitary sign proclaims you arrival and a single path disappears between the grass covered ramparts. Turning first one way and then another the mystery unfolds as a large drawbridge welcomes you to venture across and through the archway. But what next?
7133,"While the estate is several miles from the train station it can be accessed from nearby bus stops, & also has limited disabled car parking & a taxi rank directly outside the conference centre reception. There is no proper path from the road to the venue if going from the bus stop, so either you must walk on the grass or use the road & keep an eye out for cars."
7134,Excellent disabled toilet with plenty of grab rails and a red cord
7135,Disabled car parking at the start of the paths. No public transport. 
7136,"Really helpful and friendly, explaining dishes, moving furniture etc.  Also because this was a buffet, there was a quick 'clear up'."
7137,Accessible loo at Tiverton canal car park.
7138,"Excellent access. If you are on your own, I was told by the excellent member of staff at the Playhouse box office, a taxi driver would know exactly where to drop you off and from there, a member of box office staff would guide you to your seat. Couldn't get better than that!"
7139,"We visited for the current exhibition Mid-century Modern, an exhibition about mid-twentieth century design, with an emphasis on Mary Quant. There was easy access via the door in Infirmary st, and it was possible to have level access around the exhibition. We also took the lift to the viewing gallery to watch the weavers below, really very interesting. There were several other small displays here too. Masks were worn, numbers limited due to booking being necessary. "
7140,"Stopped for lunch just beside A96. First visit we will be returning,  great service and facilities "
7141,"The accessible toilet I was shown was the best I have seen in any venue, anywhere in the world. At one point there were 6 wheelchair users and 3 others in the toilet and there was still plenty of space!"
7142,Accessible toilet door opens away from the cafe but is in a corridor so it's slightly aukward. Lovely and clean and scented.  For those needing a Changing Place this cafe is a few miles from Blair Drummond Safari park and Stirling 
7143,There is ample parking and designated disabled parking. 
7144,"Okay. Access is through a heavy door though, but it has glass so you can see if there is anyone behind it.  No grab handle on the toilet door makes it hard to close for wheelchair users. Very clean toilets though."
7145,"Very helpful, couldn’t have done more,"
7146,Staff are very helpful
7147,"Accessible public toilet on ground floor, through one set of doors from the hotel lobby, that were generally left open.  The accessible toilet was right outside the accessible room, and may also be that used by Starbucks' clients during the day."
7148,This is Wetherspoon's public house so in the bar and restaurant downstairs it was an adequate disabled toilet but it did not have things like changing room facility just basic grab rails and slightly larger private toilet similar to those found in McDonald's restaurants however I was there as a hotel guest and had a fully accessible wet room 8 ft by 10 ft
7149,Easy to find.
7150,"After my first visit to the toilet I spoke with Chrissie, one of the members of staff. I felt she listened to my concerns about the problems I had experienced with the accessible toilet. she took notes and agreed to raise this with the manager. She explained that they try to offer a personalised service based on people's needs. She said that my work place had been in touch and had confirmed a person with mobility disability would be attending that day and staff had been told not to block the entrance to the accessible toilet. She arranged for the stair climber wheelchair to be removed. I also had raised that there was no mention of access on their website and this feels very unwelcoming and so do does having to use the staff only doors. She informed me that if it was sign posted then everyone would use the accessible toilet. I didn't think at the time but if they feel that concerned they could put a RADAR key lock on, as many disabled people have their own RADAR key.  Other staff appeared oblivious to the need to keep the entrance of the accessible toilet free."
7151,Staff are helpful and always help to answer any questions that you may have.
7152,"Staff were really friendly, helpful adn spoke to me not my carer"
7153,The ground floor of the house is accessible and the staff are very helpful. The upper floors are accessed by spiral staircases. The café is accessible into the covered outer area but there is a step in and not much space but the outside space was fine.  The walled gardens are accessible. There are walks here too but I didn't do them so cant say how accessible they are.
7154,Very kind (I got a lift to the supermarket when it was pouring down with rain - our host had noticed me walking and made a special trip); very helpful with any issues that we had.
7155,Large disabled toilets with grab rails.
7156,The lady who served us was fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble. She checked occasionally that everything was okay and totally ignored my dog. She could train staff elsewhere on how to behave around assistance dogs!
7157,"Would you believe it McDonald’s and Burger King had accessible toilets with three steep steps to get in. The five stars are for the Nespresso chain of coffee shops. Great access, good circulation space. Everyone joined in rearranging furniture and there was a top class loo. Ask at the counter for the code. "
7158,"Friendly and cheerful, informative when asked questions."
7159,There are bus stops right outside
7160,"Sizeable carpark but gravel so might be difficult for some. Very sporadic public transport so must have car. There is path from nearby DunnetBay caravan park, though slightly uphill to get there!"
7161,Helpful and friendly staff.
7162,Lifts in the building are too small for people with some power chairs
7163,There are 5 disabled parking spaces near the entrance. Two of these had no additional space at the sides and there wasn’t much room. The car park is quite stony and there is gravel which made it quite difficult to self propel my wheelchair. 
7164,Staff seemed helpful- it was an busy exhibition so they had their work cut out. 
7165,"Rozelle Estate covers an area of 37 hectares in South Ayrshire, which has beautiful plants and interesting wildlife such as birds, swans, ducks and squirrels etc.  The estate opened to the public in 1968 for cultural and leisure use to access the grounds of the Rozelle Estate to enjoy walks around the stunning woodland, rhododendron walks, parkland and ornamental ponds.  Inside the estate there is two galleries one of which is Rozelle House Galleries which is the permanent home to a collection of 54 paintings based on poem Tam O’ Shanter written by Robert Burns Scotland’s most famous poet.  Rozelle House is also the home to the Ayrshire Yeomanry Museum. The other gallery has a collection of traditional and modern works by commissioned artists and works purchased by the Maclaurin Trust who are the benefactors of the gallery. Throughout the estate there are a series of sculptures by the world famous sculptor Henry Moore. "
7166,See picture
7167,Huge wetroom on the ground floor as well as a further suitably equipped toilet 
7168,The employee who took us via the service lift did not seem to care about the normal lift being broken. In other respects she was friendly and helpful.
7169,"To the left of the Burger King there is a door with a pushpad on the left of the door. Pressing this takes you to the outside of two wheelchair accessible toilets! Both hand handrails on both sides, red cords hanging low and sinks that you can roll under. I used this with my powerchair and you could fit someone else in although this may be a squeeze in larger wheelchairs. Upon leaving the toilet the outer door opens automatically which is brilliant!"
7170,"You can park right outside your lodge, which is tarmac surface for parking. I went by car so not sure about public transport though I do know that the bus services in Aberdeen are generally very good."
7171,Easy to find and get in. Map helpful and signage good. Audio guide good.
7172,"Liverpool One Odeon is part of Liverpool One shopping area of Liverpool Town Centre. I don't know what the car park is like, but taxis can drop off nearby and there's a walkway to Chavasse Park which leads to the row of restaurants  the odeon is next to. The train stations, Central and Moorfields,  aren't too far away either. I would say it takes about 15 minutes to get from either one to the Odeon "
7173,"Did not use the hotel car park.  Transport around Barcelona:- Bus, Metro, Tram, Trains and Coaches were all very good."
7174,"When we knocked on th door, they came to help. "
7175,"The wet room was excellent, there was a movable hand basin which allowed easier access to the wc so that our commode/shower chair could go over the toilet bowl."
7176,The day spent at Batsford Arboretum. Beautiful at all times of the year.
7177,Spacious wet room with shower and left transfer loo.  Second accessible toilet with right transfer loo.
7178,"Wheelchair got into the bathroom without issue, can't say I looked for grab rails but must of been there for me to use. I didn't notice a cord either.  No problem getting to the sink and hand dryer either."
7179,The staff who work at Revolution Bar and Restaurant are always pleasant and very helpful. They made my visit a good experience and would always be around to lend a hand if required. 
7180,Friendly and helpful. 
7181,Lovely staff. Chatty and happy. Would go out of their way to assist you. 
7182,Parking is easy this is either at the main car park or by the visitor centre.  There is also parking near the play park area.
7183,There public local disabled parking close to the restaurant which you reach by turning left via a lane from Sinclair Street (travelling North) between West Princes St and West King Street.   The accessible parking spaces opposite the carpark entrance are closest to Restaurant (approx. 10-15 Yards).   There is flat access from carpark to the Sugar Boat.   
7184,"Due to the nature of the building, not all areas are fully accessible, but efforts have been made to increase access.  Ramps and an elevator have been installed when needed.  The museum also has two manual wheelchairs on hand."
7185,Didn’t go inside but it was instantly easy to find with a big door and a vast amount of space in front of it - they didn’t try to cram in more tables which is excellent. 
7186,"Ground floor loo easy to find as well sign-posted, and there is another at Dress Circle level. Spacious and with plenty of grabrails. Only issue is you can't reach the hand dryer without manoeuvring chair/scooter with wet hands. "
7187,"The staff were lovely. The particular waitress serving us was really friendly, helpful and attentive."
7188,The store is pedestrianised section near the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. There is parking in the nearby Buchanan Galleries.  Also not far from Queen street train station (c5 mins walk). Not sure about local buses.
7189,"The visitor centre very much embraces accessibility, with step free entrances, lifts and wide areas.  "
7190,"There is a library, shop and cafe available with no steps or blockages prohibiting access past the many close and well placed disabled parking spots. There is both a ramp and stairs up to the library and a flat and open gate from the shop to the library although the gate may be too thin for a wheelchair. The staff are friendly and all three venues are spaced out so are easy to negotiate."
7191,Sometimes you simply have to go places and they're not great - the Anne Rowling Clinic breaks the mould with a warm friendly environment and great access.
7192,"There is an accessible toilet in the main foyer area. It has a wide easy to use door, grab rails and plenty of space. It was clean and tidy.  Staff will show you where the toilet is situated if you ask as it's not immediately obvious.  There's a cloakroom service if you want to leave your coat and bags while you enjoy the event."
7193,Unbelievable parking.  Blue badge spaces 50 meters from the front door. 
7194,This was described in the introduction.
7195,On third floor down a ramp in menswear (more cluttered route) or on fourth floor through furniture on the opposite side of the building from the lifts.
7196,"We had a lovely visit to Walter Scott's house.  The car park is large and well laid out with disabled parking.  The staff in the reception area were helpful and friendly and offered us the option of carer going free without prompting.  The layout was explained fully and we were shown to the lift to the restaurant.  A lovely restaurant overlooking the grounds. The disabled toilets were clean with enough space for a mobility scooter.    There are wheelchairs available to borrow.  It was about 150 yards from the reception area to the house along a tarmac path.  There are benches along the path and one small slope.  The house was fully accessible with plenty of chairs to rest on, and a very good audio guide.  The garden was also wheelchair accessible. "
7197,Great outdoor space. There's an accessible route of a decent length with a good map provided. Accessible loo near shop and cafe both of which have decent access too.
7198,WH Smith in Letchworth is centrally located. It is not easy to get in to for wheelchair users - the doors are heavy and awkward to open wide enough to get a wheelchair in (no automation or button to call for assistance). Once inside the store layout is also a challenge. The aisles may be technically wide enough to get a wheelchair (or baby buggy down) - but in reality the additional stands at the end of pretty much every aisle make it virtually impossible to move around the store. When we visited with a wheelchair at least 4 aisles were completely inaccessible.
7199,"There is complete disabled access at the PEAK. Everything is clearly mapped out, and everything was clear enough to see. Their is both stairs and a lift and plenty of seating on the top and bottom floors. "
7200,"The loo was fine, plenty of room and clean enough. However there were really long queues of disabled people at peak times which may mean they need to have a few more. I liked that they use the radar key scheme. The toilets were not abused here either which was great. "
7201,"The drivers of the taxis were exceptional, they took time to tell us a lot about the castle on the journey up. Staff in museums were friendly, helpful and accommodating. "
7202,"A lovely little cafe open to the general public attached to the hospice. Disabled parking spaces, ramp access and wide automatic door into the venue. Inside access to the seating area and servery is spacious. Only one toilet for all customers including disabled. Food is lovely, a good variety, excellent quality and polite staff. One to go back to. "
7203,Properly equipped disabled toilets. And I liked that there was a toilet block in the car park including a disabled toilet. If like me you always need the loo once you've arrived this is good
7204,"Brilliant - roomy enough to manoeuvre wheelchair inside, plenty of grab rails, super clean. All loos should be like this!"
7205,A short walk from Vauxhall station and on numerous bus routes. Blue badge parking is available to pre book.
7206,There is ramped access at the left hand side of the cafe/shop. Unfortunately you come across a bit of a textured pavement but its ok. If some of the outside tables were moved it a bit it could be a lot better.  Entrance is fine and there is a good accessible loo.  There are a good handful of low tables to sit at but you have to navigate past the high tables with bar stools to get to them. It would be great if they could be swapped over - or at least one or 2 lower tables put nearer the accessible loo and the counters.
7207,"If you don't plan to take the train or coach to The Proact and you have access to an adapted vehicle, personally I would use it to get to stadium. If you phone customer services at the Tesco right next to the ground and talk to them nicely, they will let you park in the disabled parking there. The car park there is very accessible for a tail or side lift and the walk to the entrances takes only two minutes maximum."
7208,"I got wheelchair taxi into town, but street parking car parks nearby, dedicated disabled parking spaces nearby Public transport bust stop 2 minutes away"
7209,The paths are rough which makes it difficult to move around in a wheelchair but not impossible. You can hire a wheelchair if necessary for a additional fee. Ask the staff about this when you get inside.  Ground floor of the house is accessible. To access the terrace with stunning views of the Surrey hills and the walled garden you do need to cross a small area of grass which can be muddy and make your wheelchair dirty on a cold day. Keep in mind that not all of the walled garden or grounds are accessible because of a number of steps. There is a wheelchair accessible map available at the entrance. Plenty of parking available in the carpark as well. 
7210,No problem getting a blue badge parking space near the entrance.
7211,"Ladies toilet had a steep but short ramp to get in and labelled up as the disabled toilet. Gents toilet not accessible, no alternative toilets available, no companion toilets available."
7212,"It is signposted and there is a ramp to the front door, and a lift inside. I’m sure I saw a sign for a hearing loop but I’m not 100% certain"
7213,"Staff great, 1st class"
7214,"I came by car, parked each time with blue badge on George Street."
7215,Car park round the back
7216,The staff were very helpful.
7217,I didn't need to use the disabled toilet but it was at the end of a short corridor which had to be accessed via a heavy door which opened outwards. Not ideal.
7218,"There is plenty of disabled parking areas allocated around the building, this being on the front and around the back. however there is no back entrance to the cinema and this could be difficult for some individuals to travel all the way around the cinema to gain access. There is a metro-link station near to the leisure park, however no bus services that stop on the park."
7219,Easy to get to down the wide aisle. Big toilet with lots of handles. The waitress followed me down and opened the door for me although it wasnt necessary to. She was there again to hold it open when I exited too. Very thoughtful.
7220,"Disabled loo on the ground floor, you do need to open two doors however.  Spacious enough, could do with a slightly higher toilet."
7221,Standard disabled toilet.
7222,On-street parking only but one Disabled space at front of venue.
7223,There are lifts in the buildings that take you to the next level. There is a mobility point upstairs where you get the lift to and you just leave ID or a ten pound note with someone and get it back when you return the equipment.
7224,"To enter there a slight step that is slanted due to the shop being located on a slight hill. The lowest point of the step is manageable for wheelchair users however, I did need someone to push my wheel up at the higher end because I got stuck. There is no ramp available.  Once inside there is a lot of items for on display but I managed to drive around the shop okay, it was a little narrow though. Some of the items were on display nearer the floor which I was a little worried I would run over but, the shop owner offered to move anything that was in my way.  The till point was a little high for my wheelchair and there were some items in front of the till which might restrict customers in wheelchairs to reach the till as well."
7225,There were disabled toilet facilities on all floors which were clean and very spacious.
7226,There’s no parking outside but there are some disabled parking spaces on Grindlay Street however it gets busy. However it's possible to get dropped off there if theres no spaces left.
7227,"The Rijksmuseum is accessible by many forms of transportation.  It takes an average of 11 minutes to arrive on a bicycle from the Amsterdam Central Station.  It is also accessible by tram, bus, or taxi.  If traveling by tram, look for the ITS symbol to ensure full accessibility.  If arriving by car, there is a nice accessible parking garage located at the Museumplein,  The company Accessible Travel Netherlands can arrange accessible taxis for you."
7228,Nothing out the ordinary
7229,Easy level access throughout. No steps anywhere.   Lift available to the upper floors but we were lucky enough to get the ground floor.
7230,The hotel staff I met were helpful to a point but it didn’t resolve my inability to access the building. The rating reflects their willingness to have a conversation.
7231,"The Nature Reserve is mainly on a level surface. However there are steeper slopes up to bridges (but there are only about 2 bridges in the whole nature reserve) and a slope up to the Nature Centre if you wish to go in the cafe and access the toilets. If an individual finds it difficult to mobilise on a gradient, they may wish to avoid bridges by starting their walk from the path to the left of the carpark (when facing the carpark from Barton Lane).  The path surfaces are firm, although slightly bumpy from the gravel. After a period of much rain some paths become flooded, or may be more muddy.  If an individual has limited mobility/stamina, it is important to note that they may be unable to do the full circuit of the Nature Reserve (about 3hours), however a shorter route is possible."
7232,"Having asked specifically for a room with disabled access and being assured this would not present a problem, turned up to discover that the room was only accessible via a flight of stairs! Also, no grab rail in the shower/bath, so I am really confused as to what the hotel considers a disabled accessible room.   We were there for a wedding, which took place in the hotel. To access that, we had to go down some steps, up another two sets of steps and then down another flights of stairs. No lift available to reach it. Thank goodness I wasn't in my wheelchair is all I can say.  It's a real shame, as the service was lovely and the room was small but nice. However, I dare not stay here again as my legs will not take it. They shouldn't be advertising themselves as disabled and wheelchair accessible."
7233,Staff very friendly
7234,"All the staff we had contact with were very friendly and polite. For me the OCS teams were FIRST CLASS with the Eagle Lifter. I might add Belfast International Airport is the only airport on the island of Ireland with an Eagle Lifter. I had two men on the inbound flight and a lady and a man on the outbound flight, both teams done OCS proud. "
7235,"There is a wheelchair accessible restaurant cafe open 7 days a week, serving a good slection of food and drinks. The outside area ia also suitable for wheelchairs.  Very helpful and friendly staff. Have visited several times and taken friends there."
7236,"Holly Lodge is a cottage attached to The Hollies, Bed and Breakfast. It's a self-catering holiday but Jan and John the owners, were good enough to treat us with a full English one day when the B&B was empty. They only have two B&B rooms, so the place was never heaving. As a double amputee, all the modifications suited me, so should catch all those with lesser disabilities. I do believe there is also provision for with sight and hearing impairment. The accessible bedroom is on the ground floor as is the accessible bathroom/wet room, but with plenty of room to manoeuvre my powered wheelchair. There are also two bedrooms upstairs for friends/family. Maximum capacity is seven, I believe.   Nothing is too much trouble for Jan and John but they are no way intrusive. They are a font of local knowledge which came in handy more than once. I loved the way we could lower the work tops in the kitchen. It allowed me to indulge in my first love of cooking. Great place and I can't praise it highly enough. Pet friendly.  Already booked for next year!"
7237,There are two accessible toilets at either side of the food and drinks till upstairs. I think there would be enough space for someone in a wheelchair to transfer as well as having assistance from who they are with. You are only able to transfer from the left side of the toilet though as it is closer to the wall at the right.  These facilities are not suitable for my requirements though as I need a hoist which is only found in a changing place toilet.
7238,"There is a public toilet for you, plain and simple, but very clean with basic facilities. It had grab rails and pull cord, and you can just about spin in there."
7239,"Space for a career, grab rails and easily found from the one floor of this venue which is accessible (that's if the lift is working)"
7240,"Unusual offices based in the Mansfield Traquar Centre, an old church. Accessible once you know how."
7241,Excellent v good
7242,Blue badge bays within a short distance of the enterance. The enterance is flat and paved well. There is also a number of other public transport options available. Best to check out their website for what suits you best.
7243,"Discounted ticket prices are provided but proof of disability and official carer status must be shown.  Wheelchair users can get all around the park and there are no areas restricted by steps. However, pathways are uneven rough tracks. Mud, stones and gravel are a serious problem unless you have an all-terrain wheelchair."
7244,As a 27 year old using my wheelchair for the first time I can honestly say how fantastic the steward staff were with me. They couldn't do enough for me and made this experience enjoyable even as an away supporter
7245,"Parking and disabled parking on cobbles in town parking serving the other stores and shops around, restaurant located on a busy main road in and out of the town so be careful. "
7246,"step-free access to reception , to restaurant, breakfast room and bedrooms.  Lifts to all floors.  Seating in the reception area"
7247,Plenty of accessible toilets. One on every floor. There is a lift but it isn't huge.
7248,A lovel 3 course meal from a wide and varied menu. Tables look out over Cullen beach and we were lucky to see some dolphins jumping in the sea. Staff were great while wearing their masks. everything was well spread out and clearly signed to enable us to keep our distance and maintain Covid-19 compliance.
7249,Carluccio's is an Italian restaurant chain. We visited the branch at St Pancras International Station.
7250,Fully wheelchair accessible throughout with lefts up to the restaurant . 
7251,Staff are always very helpful and always bring my order over to my table when I am unable to carry it safely myself 
7252,"I found the cinema itself to be sub-par relative to other Edinburgh cinemas in terms of safety, cost, quality, and value."
7253,Great food and they have made an effort to make it as accessible as possible
7254,Parking was in a dedicated accessible parking area adjacent to the main entrance.
7255,"The only way to get into Waterloo East Station step-free is via the pedestrian footbridge from Waterloo Station, which is served by a spacious lift from the main concourse at Waterloo. The station entrance in Sandell Street is not step-free.   Having arrived at Waterloo East, the only way to get from the concourse to the platforms is via VERY steep and long ramps. These ramps are too steep to be safe and usable for any but the strongest and most determined manual wheelchair users, and it would be possible to lose control on the sharp downward descent. With a powerchair I had no difficulty.   Staff are available to assist with boarding/alighting trains with a manual boarding ramp, but they routinely deploy the ramps incorrectly and unsafely, putting passengers at risk of accident and serious injury, and some of the staff are shockingly rude."
7256,A lift to the first floor display area. Smooth access throughout.
7257,There was a large easily accessible toilet. It was clean and tidy and had hand rails.  We didn't get the opportunity to have a further look. 
7258,There is one wheelchair toilet this is to the left as you come up the ramp radar key will open the door outwards good basic toilet but no room for care giver if required could have been cleaner as well
7259,"Great food and very enjoyable, you can access well the place in a wheelchair, they will ask if you want to transfer to a booth seat (which is most of the seating ) and they will take your chair away, alternatively there is a small seating area, with 2 x tables for 4 and 1 x table for 2, this is not fixed seating and therefore could accommodate a larger power chair, but I would phone to let them know first. The toilets are at the back and the aisle is wide enough to accommodate a larger power chair., as usual the staff often use the disabled toilet, not sure if they are really great employing people with  hidden disability  - or just the staff like the disabled toilet, but anyway - it is not too busy for a short wait."
7260,"I attended a concert here and was impressed with the facilities available. The stages house now all case kisses from a baby boy is at the far side when you enter and despite being one of the first there I still didn't make it to the front. The staff however made room for me so that I was in the front and could see everything! I don't drink so I wasn't bothered about the fact that I can get to the bar. My only criticism, and it is small, is that the disabled toilet is accessed by the main door. Whilst the spacious and has everything that you need, it is difficult to manoeuvre around people loitering at the entrance."
7261,"Accessible toilets in the function area, however I’m not sure what a person is to do if they are just having a meal or staying at the hotel how there meant to access the toilet when a function is actually on! Gate crash it 🤦🏻‍♂️"
7262,"This is a review of Auschwitz-Birkenau, an extermination camp, which was in operation during World War II. Some people might find the text and photos in this review upsetting.   Auschwitz is the smaller but better preserved of the two camps. If you can manage the steps, there is lots to see inside the individual buildings. A short ride away is Birkenau which was the larger camp but not so much survives as the Nazis tried to destroy it to hide their atrocities, so a lot it is open ground. Both sites are emotionally and physically demanding to navigate.  I went on a guided tour which was organised by Krakow Direct. However, there are many similar companies which offer similar tours."
7263,They're was everything
7264,"There is a person at the door to help people with the lift up the first few stairs, then there is a lift which takes you up to the restaurant. The guy on the door was very helpful and friendly."
7265,This was more difficult our disabled adapted vehicle is too high for the underground multi story. I did ask a security man who said I could park in the coach bay. Atbristol did offer to help.
7266,"Only really accessible by car. Plenty of onsite parking though sometimes difficult to park near reception on arrival (not obviously signed from the car park) Once booked in, Having prebooked a mobility scooter, and disabled room, by sending a copy of my wife’s blue badge, we had a reserved parking space close to our ground floor room. It’s a big site but navigable by wheelchair and mobility scooter - even indoors (but see below)"
7267,On my most recent visit staff were cold and brusque.   The fact that the staff have not dealt with the toilet problems (see above) which I mentioned to them eight months ago is a further reason for my very low staff star-rating.
7268,The staff we met and particular those in the cafe were welcoming and helpful.
7269,Limited disabled street parking outside. Large car park in next street that is free for blue badge holders.
7270,Fully equiped although the loo was quite high.
7271,"Lovely venue with lots of accessible resources. Lift can get very busy as central feature of venue. Fantastic environment that can be a bit over stimulating for autistic visitors, this is not a problem though as lovely staff, sensory backpacks, early openings and accessible sessions make the whole experience very inclusive. Took part in a lovely sensory story to the jungle today, was enjoyed by the whole family. My daughter was on the periphery but 100% included. Well done seven stories and a huge thank you!"
7272,The access is perfectly fine. Your choice of seating is slightly restricted but there is nothing that would dissuade me from going there.
7273,"Large public carpark near venue, 2 accessible spaces were some distance away, and had no drop downs to access pavement. Limited street parking available Public Bus Stance 5 minutes away"
7274,"Stopped to have a quick lunch, do some shopping and use the accessible toilet. Will use again as a good distance up the A9 and worked well."
7275,"https://www.hamburger-kunsthalle.de Germany's largest art museum, with a great collection of art works by many famous artists, including Magritte, Paul Klee, Edvard Munch, Henry Moore, Jean Arp, Giocometti and a number of famous Impressionists.  We started in the old building (Lichtwark Gallery) with the Altmeisterwerke, including  some absolutely wonderful religious triptychs from the middle ages.  There is a room devoted to Cranach - but we were very disappointed to find it closed during our visit.  We spent 3 hours there, and did not see anywhere near all of it.  In particular, we did not make it over to the new building, the Gallery of Contemporary art.    We had some very nice afternoon tea in the cafetaria (Cafe Das Liebermann) - accessible, with plenty of space to get to a table.  There is also a restaurant in the newer building, but we didn't go there.  "
7276,The Spark Building is about a 20 minute walk from Southampton Central Railway Station. I was staying nearby at Jury's Inn which was a 2 minute level walk away. 
7277,"Lift inside requires user to hold button but staff will assist with this.  Access around venue is good.  One part of Museum not accessible as stairs, but alternative route. "
7278,"The nearest tube station is Sloane Square, which is not step-free, but does have escalators from the westbound (but NOT the eastbound) platform to street level, so if you can get out of your wheelchair and take it up an escalator, this station may be an option. Loads of buses go along the King's Road. I wouldn't attempt to park nearby."
7279,"It was a bit of a bumpy ramp in and out of the tent. Went to go into Piping Centre for tour and had to wait as guy had no key to let us in (glad it was not raining)  Could not get to where food and drink was, had to get it brought to us.."
7280,Access was generally excellent. The whole site is relatively flat and easily negotiated by a reasonably fit self propelled wheelchair user.
7281,The staff that I spoke to were friendly
7282,"Accessible toilet is by the upstairs bar, so wheelchair and scooter users need to go outside and round the corner if in the downstairs bar.  Once there, all is very accessible."
7283,"There is step free access and a lift to the first floor with accessible toilets on both levels. There is a detailed access statement available from the museum if you need more information.  Also a lift to the first floor. Accessibilty is to all parts of the museum.  Plenty of opportunities to rest and see film clips or listen to talks. The museum overall is sparkling clean, and tidy and spacious. The locals are so proud of their museum they have an interest in keeping it friendly attractive and accessible for visitors. "
7284,We got around the grounds easily with a wheelchair-buggy.  Fairly flat.
7285,"Access to building was easy enough but we couldn't see any sign of a lift. There must be one but it isn't obvious where it is. There are a few flights of stairs to access the lecture theatre, where the show we saw (Milton Jones and the Temple of daft) was performed."
7286,Ground floor toilets available but not used for the general public.
7287,"Buses either to Morrison street, just a couple of mins walk, or to Lothian road, again a short walk. "
7288,We drove and there is free parking for Blue Badge holders. The spaces are spacious and it is easy to access the restaurants and the lift to the shops and cinema from them.
7289,"The Art Gallery and Museum has great access for wheelchair users. From the street entrance the building looks inaccessible but you can enter easily via the car park entrance onto the lower ground floor of the museum. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would suggest picking up a floor plan on your way in, there are wall mounted maps but the writing is smaller and sometimes they are mounted a bit high. Walking round the museum there are plenty of staff ready to help and also two information desks on the lower ground and ground floors. There is plenty to see and accessibility in the majority of rooms is great. "
7290,"Toilet within wet room. 2 handrails for toilet,  right transfer. Rails by sink, within shower and at door. Fold down seat within shower area."
7291,Very friendly. Made welcome and not rushed. 
7292,"Due to it being an old town, it is increadably steep every where the main high street is horrendous and this is where the main shops are."
7293,"This for us was an unknown quantity, but the moment we came through the door it was brilliant. It is a new build and has been really well thought out. A fantastic accessible room, with wooden flooring rather than carpet to make it easier for a wheelchair. Loads of space. Very clean. Staff lovely and open to suggestions as to potential improvement as they make no secret of the fact they want to make it accessible as possible. Can't recommend highly enough. "
7294,When I arrived at the connecting departure gate I was taken into the Lufthansa lounge to wait for boarding. It was here I visited the accessible toilet which was huge and had all the essentials. 
7295,Wheelchair accessible throughout ground floor and external areas
7296,"On Zampeliou, the street running parallel to the harbour I  found a free public step free, accessible toilet with a single grab rail. If you exit the harbour at El Venizelou Square and turn into the side street next to Star Bucks, and then at the first left side turn you will find the public toilets on the corner. The toilets were clean. Since returning I saw on tripadvisor that someone had posted a photo of the front of another block of public toilets which are near to the Giali Tzamissi mosque and they have an accessible ramp and accessible toilet sign, however I didn't use these during my visit. There is also an accessible toilet in the Arachnology Museum (see separate review) but there is an admission charge. I didn't notice any in the restaurants I visited.  "
7297,"There are no step-free stations nearby. Several bus routes will drop you off in the Strand, which is just a block away."
7298,"Great food, great atmosphere.  I’ve returned because I’ve enjoyed it so much!"
7299,Wonderful! Light airy & spacious... Lots of work has gone into making it a stylish and welcoming environment. Level access throughout. Dropped height reception desk.
7300,"Staff are friendly, pointed out the best route, helped when confronted with tractors, hoses and other obstacles."
7301,Excellent off the street level 
7302,all on the  flat outside the museum and inside theres lifts to get upstairs.  everything is on eye level 
7303,There were three accessible loos but I only visited two as one was in the basement. The toilets were basic with silver rails around the toilet and sink. The loo on the third floor was bigger than the one on 1st floor.   No changing places toilet. According to the website Manchester Aquatic Centre and Manchester Royal Infirmary have a changing places toilet. 
7304,"We started our visit at the car park for the lido and gardens, (photo 1) and it looked a very nice park, spring plants just opening up (2) and around the corner we found a duck pond with early morning fishermen already settle in for the day (3) then drove round via sat NAV directions to car park for shopping centre, free for disabled for 3 hours, bit it has a very steep slope to get down to shops (4) harder when you return for carer to push up. "
7305,"Not sure, however the restaurant has it's own toliets at the back"
7306,"From where we were it was only around two hundred yards walk, ether on the main side, or the seafront walk.  There was parking at the side as well as underground.  A large lift (as well as escalators)  went between the two levels"
7307,A welcome retreat from the only hour's rain in a week!
7308,I organised passenger assist for a train from Guildford to Olympia via Clapham. They rescheduled  train without me knowing and didn't stop at Clapham. There were no ramps at Waterloo so I had to hold the open door button and Jam my chair to stop the door closing so the train wouldn't leave while my carer tried to find a guard!
7309,"There is an accessible toilet on the roof top but it is not signed and if coming to it from the lower level of the rooftop, the ramp is almost impossible without someone pushing hard. There was a railing to stop other people entering the accessible toilet which also prevented me from getting in without a friend to open it. Once along the flat wooden corridor you need to use a knife to open the toilet door, because they lock it like that from the outside.    The stall itself was very large with space for a carer but only one grab rail. They had a read cord that was properly installed however. No sink in the stall so you have to roll back down the very steep ramp to wash your hands. All the toilets are compost toilets so it has a very DIY feel to it."
7310,No issues with parking. Plenty around and can park at the Albert Dock a short walk away.
7311,"We live nearby, so go quite regularly.  The family love it!  Huge, accessible, get your own food."
7312,Fantastic. Not monitored but spaces right outside the door.
7313,The Museum has a separate car park for Blue Badge Holders which is closer to the Museum than the none-badge holder car park.   We did not have a Blue Badge but there is a 'drop off' point right outside the main entrance where it was safe to disembark our car and not have to rush.  There is also a bus stop right outside the main entrance.
7314,"Ramps allow easy movement from one section to another, where the transition isn't level. It's a large site though and there are no resting places if you're on foot.  There's a wheelchair to borrow if you need one (or if you forgot yours like I did!).  Ground is a bit ueven in places - not a big issue, but care is needed.  Two sections (home wares and outdoor clothing) in the shop are raised up and completely inaccessible - not helpful, Notcutts!"
7315,I use a walking stick with no issues
7316,Very friendly and helpful staff. 
7317,"Access was simple, through a tunnel and straight onto the pitch."
7318,"There is a small lip into the shop which may be problematic for some wheelchair users, but it is very small. Inside the space is quite tight but chairs are all movable and it's table service. "
7319,The staff are very helpful and friendly
7320,Waitinhg staff nice enough but too brisk and rushed off so  didn't hear all requests.  Greeter was just rude when asked about toilets.
7321,This is self catering accommodation without staff. Our hosts were however on hand should we have needed anything.
7322,"For rail travellers, this is not far from the station. Car parking doesn't seem to be a problem in Thurso. This hotel's entrance (stepped) is directly off an uneven pavement."
7323,Very helpfull
7324,"Great disabled loo outside canal centre, radar key operated. Pub also has one but not so nice."
7325,On street parking outside.
7326,Friendly and welcoming.
7327,This is a brand new school complex with dedicated community spaces. Wide doors and corridors and spacious community rooms. 
7328,There is a lift up from the car park to the actual site. Although it is a ruin there are lots of paved areas making it easy to get round most of it. 
7329,Louisa was my ski instructor and she was brilliant. She made me feel very comfortable when I arrived and helped fill in my form. She answered all questions I had and explained each stage in detail. Louisa was also reassuring and attentive by ensuring I was comfortable at all times. 
7330,Lots of room to admire the building from the outside. Easy to access from the train station and parking is also quite close by. Nice wide open space to the entrance and lift to the 2nd floor where the exhibitions are located. 
7331,The welcome from the staff was very friendly and helpful. We were seated in a spacious comfortable lounge with a nice atmosphere. We all chose different dishes off the menu and they were all delicious  
7332,"Generally good, step-free throughout, all areas accessible. Some of the floors are made of a horrible soft rough-textured material which is really hard work to traverse in a wheelchair. This seems pointless to me, and should be replaced with smooth flooring. One star lost for this, and another star lost because some of the lifts were out of order. Another star lost because online booking for disabled people bringing a companion/carer is not possible, you have to phone for that, and although I waited in the phone queue AGES on several occasions, the phone was never answered. Very annoying."
7333,"Step free, double width doors if you need them"
7334,There are two bathrooms with toilets for disabled people. One is a Wetroom. Plenty of well placed grab rails
7335,"The ground floor accessible toilet has a light door.  It is spacious and has a mirror, sink and hand dryer at be correct height. The only negative is the height of the flush handle which is impossible to reach from a wheelchair."
7336,"As the restaurant is set at the entrance of a large shopping centre, there was lots of spaces. We found a disabled bay easily, which is a short walk to the restaurant."
7337,Blue Badge parking bays are just around the corner from the store's entrance.
7338,"was there to try out the swimming pool. I was on crutches and had to wear shoes by the poolside. It was important for me to have easy access into the water, and I was very impressed by the fact that there were two sets of proper steps, rather than stepladders, to access the water. The steps have a rail to hold onto, all the way into the water and the steps are long and shallow. For wheelchair users, there is a hoist. There is a disabled shower, complete with chair on small wheels, in the ladies' toilets. I actually found it difficult to manipulate, although the wheels did have breaks. I would say that it would be more suitable for wheelchair users than ambulant disabled."
7339,"Clean and functional, available on court level and also cafe level."
7340,"We parked in a pay-and-display car park a few streets away from the museum, and that distance was fine for my small scooter. If you needed to be dropped off right outside, that looked as if it would be possible, as the entrance in on a fairly quiet side street, but I wouldn't count on getting a street parking place there."
7341,Lovely wheelchair accessible coastal trail.
7342,Didn't use the restroom but it was clearly labelled and visible. 
7343,"The main car park involves a walk to the old quarters, and it’s almost impossible to park along it’s main streets, but you never know, you may just find a spot. It’s at least worth driving through to see the old historical buildings, and to get the best view of Blenheim Palace. "
7344,Friendly and non-discriminatory.
7345,One accessible toilet. Clean and the red cord touched the ground. No photo as there is one from the previous review. I also liked the fact the door was not heavy so I could open and close it myself and there was plenty of room for me to turn around and open the door.
7346,Not marked but easy to find once we were directed. It's just on the other side of the hall.
7347,"Three stars because they were very mixed. Some couldn't have been more helpful - handing out bottles of water for free, helping at the welfare tent and being very good with directions. Some were completely unreasonable, being rude to festival-goers or being completely clueless as to what was going on. By the end of the festival, most of the volunteer staff were completely miserable (as they told us themselves). "
7348,blue badge parking largely reserved for shopmobility. No additional time or allowance made for blue badge holders. Very expensive.
7349,"Wide door and good circulation space. Entry, exit and lock is via a light touch  button on the wall.  Side transfer should be from right to left but large nappy bin in the way. I asked for it to be moved. We will see what happens. Another reason why baby changing should NOT be in accessible toilets. "
7350,"The nearest tube stations are Camden Town and Chalk Farm, both of  which do not have step free access. The nearest accessible tube station is King's Cross. Alternatively you could use Tottenham Court Road tube and get the number 24 to Hartland Road/ Camden Market stop, which is close to the entrance of the market.  The are a number of buses that travel between Camden High Street and Chalk Farm which stop near Camden Market."
7351,"Very friendly, willing and able, nicely attired. "
7352,"As with most Historic, Ancient building, monuments and Gardens in the UK, there is a lot to be said for good training, good observational skills, being warm, friendly informative and having the patience and abilities to deliver an experience to visitors.  I asked to speak to the Head of their Guiding staff to share some ideas and compliment them on the excellent delivery of the Volunteer and professional Guides."
7353,"Park in car park, which has fine gravel over which a wheelchair can be pushed or pulled a short distance before level, paved paths."
7354,Neutral interactions.
7355,All level from car park 
7356,the staff was very at tentative once they realised i was disabled 
7357,"Free entrance. Suits anyone with walking impairment or wheelchair user. Easy access by car on Lisburn Dublin main Rd just outside Banbridge. Plenty of disabled car parking and easy flat surface from all spaces to gallery. Disabled toilets just at entrance large & fully equipped with houist. Lovely bright 1 room gallery with visiting contemporary national  exhibits often with links to locality & sculptor FE McWilliams. Wheelchair friendly sculpture garden & studio in grounds. Excellent cafe - friendly waitress served- homemade local produce , tomatoes soup & wheaten bread, battered fish & chips, crab salad, club sandwiches  good coffee & cakes. High standard tasty food medium priced. Small selection of craft/ gifts. "
7358,smooth with no steps or need for additonal ramps however large glass doors which would need support opening. the dining area is spacious and laid out long rows of tables. there are booths but these are not wheelchair friendly. waiting staff seemed very supportive to wheelchair users and encouraged just to mention when making a booking and a table near the bar (which would mean near main entrance and Disabled toilet) would be reserved.
7359,"Through very, very heavy door form shop to corridor and then the door immediately in front was the accessible toilet - so no chance of holding one door whilst opening another, which also had the heaviest fire closure I have ever encountered.  Toilet small, with no transfer space, alarm cord cut off and the small piece left hooked over a very high window sill.  Could not get out of the toilet and got trapped in there for 15 minutes.  Other accessible toilet in the park was bigger, but still had a door with such a heavy fire closure that I could not get in or out without assistance."
7360,"An ok venue to have a drink if the weather is nice enough to sit outside, if you can't use steps then this isn't the place for you should you need to visit the loo"
7361,"Level entry front door, excellent for my scooter. I could use my scooter outside on the paving slabs and enjoy the view. Cottage on one level, living room with kitchen and dining, bedroom and adapted bathroom."
7362,Loo in the ensuite is quite low.  Left side transfer.   Grab rails both sides.    I was offered a raiser seat.    There is a second loo in the utility room off the living area which is higher but does not have grab rails.    
7363,easy there are concert paths all the way around
7364,"I love stills, they always have good photography exhibitions on and downstairs you can do classes, which always has tempted me.   I visited the space during Disabled Access Day and throughly enjoyed learning about the exhibition and the way it was displayed."
7365,"The staff tried their best to be helpful and accommodating.  The woman who took the enquiry, once she understood what was required, gave assurances that were more than fully met.  The receptionist at check in was also helpful.  The cleaner servicing the room did a good job."
7366,Helpful. English not as good as other cities on Black Sea but enough to get by. 
7367,"Wide automatic doors at the entrance, wheelchair adapted trolleys and spacious aisles make this a good supermarket experience. Lighting is bright, signage is clear and floors are smooth. I like this supermarket because the order of the aisles rarely changes, meaning I always know where I need to go to find what I'm looking for. "
7368,Number 8 bus goes down and up Broughton Street regularly 
7369,The staff were lovely. However the lifts were very difficult to get an electric wheelchair in the lift  (we managed eventually) and the changing place was very small with the bed only having excess from one side. But the staff were lovely and the expeditions were well spaced with no worry of accidently damaging anything. 
7370,If you are confident enough to wave them down. they're great :D
7371,"Excellent accessibility to Peter Scott nature reserve featuring a birds of the world side with tarmac paths and close ups of the birds and a wild side which still has accessible hides and very good surfaces. Ignore 'unsuitable for wheelchair' signs on some paths, they are all fine."
7372,"Downstairs barman very helpful with choice of beers, and with directing me to the disabled toilet"
7373,"So change of ownership in 2015.  Peebles Hydro new management has no disability awareness.  The new Disabled parking space are away from the entrance on the wrong side of the drive way backing onto a steep slope.   The lounge area is an obstacle course of badly place furniture making it impossible to move around safely, and due to the lack of free flow from the lounge, the sun lounge area is completely out of bounds.  The seating is not disable friendly with mostly seating that's too low, with few with arms, most with little or no back support. The disabled changing room/toilet in the pool area is now joint family changing room, so as the hydro is swapped with children there is no easy access to disabled changing facilities. Despite there being all the family facilities in both male and female changing areas.  The dining room now has family tables mix throughout the area, there is no safe corner for those with mobility issues, the tables for 2 are too low and the chairs have no support"
7374,Level access with automatic doors
7375,"Having such a wide, open public space as you enter the building did make it feel like it would be good for those with various access requirements. I did feel like the floor may be a bit slippy for some.  Signage for entering and exiting the main permanent exhibition space was not great. The doors were very heavy although when I was there a member of staff was positioned there to open the door for you.   Despite the central areas feeling spacious, the layout of the permanent exhibition made it feel crowded. There were times when you had to step back after reading the interpretation to find what it was talking about as the item was placed up high above other items which made it quite confusing and caused a bit of congestion in those areas."
7376,Helpful.
7377,"The staff at the marina were excellent and i forgot my medication and had to have it sent me via courier to the marina and the lady there drove to find us and give me the tablets,excellent service."
7378,"Really easy to get in and around in a manual wheelchair. Able to get round all displays, inside and out. Pleasant gardens to look around. Good homemade food and helpful, friendly staff! Very clean accessible toilets.   Only slightly negative issue was that there were only 4 disabled parking spaces, all full!  However, would recommend a visit and I will go again!"
7379,The staff are just so lovely and helpful. Received a lovely welcome. They are a credit to the place. Service was excellent. 
7380,Friendly and helpful 
7381,Car park with 4 disabled spaces. The restaurant is on the outskirts of Stirling beside the motorway so not sure about public transport 
7382,great transport links close to bus and train station small car park at the side of the theatre with disabled spaces
7383,"No problems. They have changing facilities with hoist and adjustable bed, enough room for two carers and wheelchair. "
7384,"No steps, fairly level  tracks & roads - compacted gravel,and plenty of Tarmac. Just 1 moderate push up a slight incline. "
7385,"At Watersinks there's a formal car park - gravel, smallish and no blue badge spaces. The surface is uneven and you'll have to pick your spot to transition from car park to path - there's a sizeable step most of the way round but it's more level, if a little uneven, in some places. Further along the road (drive on with Watersinks on the left) there's an informal parking area which I believe leads to the same gravel track.  However we used Watersinks successfully."
7386,The 'disabled moo loos' in George Square were clearly signposted and situated beside the ladies and gents. There was a ramp to the toilet door but unfortunately the door opened out the way necessitating any wheelchair user to pull the door open while rolling back down the slope. The loo had grab rails and plenty of space inside. It also had a sharps box which was alarmingly open (but fortunately empty) when we were there.
7387,"I went to Social Bite with Mum, venue was bright airy and cherful. Staff were fantastic and adepts quickly to cater to my needs.  Food was  delicious  and  yummy I had the beef stories. The staff were  extremely sensitive  to my needs. Yummy food fantastic price Awsime staff, "
7388,The signage was good. There weren't many lifts but many stairs. 
7389,Disabled parking round the front.
7390,"Before going to Cyprus, friends warned us that the Zoo would be too hilly to get the wheelchair about.  Nonsense.  Although there are a few hills within the zoo, they were not bad at all.  We got the public service bus from the bus station at Paphos Harbour upto Coral Bay and then the zoos shuttle bus.  I managed this as I could transfer from my wheelchair, which was stowed in the back of the bus.  Tickets bought and armed with a map, off we went to explore the zoo.  As mentioned, we found the gradients quitter manageable and that the different animal enclosures within easy distance from each other meaning we had viewing stops as we went.  We took in the bird show which appeared to be the same as ones we have seen in other countries, including the UK.  Indeed, the two people doing the show were British.   It was a pity that some of the audience did not adhere to the request to remain seated but no fault of those doing the show.   We enjoyed seeing most of the animals, We especially enjoyed watching the rapport the  ‘keeper’ had with the elephant whilst hosing it down.  We noticed a few bits where one paid an extra 10 euros, such as feeding giraffes.  We were slightly surprised to see small children doing this whilst the ‘zoo person’ sat and reads a book.  Although we are not really ‘Zoo people’ we did enjoy the numerous animals on display and appreciate the layout of the zoo.  Other ‘non animal attractions included Cactus Gardens, a Keepers House, Natural History museum, Art Museum, Traditional Cypriots house.  Lots of attractions to spend a couple of hours at least.  All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Paphos Zoo and shall do so again should we get back to Cyprus.  "
7391,"No hoist, standard disabled loo but you'll have to fight the healthies for the loo at break time as they don't want to wait for the normal toilets"
7392,"Access is gained around the side of the Hotel at the rear, in Reception are 2 wheelchair lifts for the few steps up in this Victorian Building, Plus lifts throughout to most floors. The Staff went above and beyond to give us a bedroom to use for the day for toileting purposes as we were not staying, just visiting for a Wedding"
7393,A step at the entrance and a few areas inside are up a few steps. There is an accessible bathroom by one of the bars. It can get quite crowded.
7394,The toilet totally meets my needs.  There are commodes available that are modern and very clean.  
7395,"There are nearby bus stops & taxi ranks, but not accessible tube stations."
7396, There  is an  accessible disabled toilet on the ground floor which has an emergency red current cord. See photo
7397,Quite small (but at least the door opens outwards). The baby changing table gets in the road a bit.
7398,"Staff were very helpful and welcoming, but I only saw 2 of them. 1 lady was at the museum and when I asked about visiting John Wesley's House she explained she couldn't leave the museum and gave me directions. Then another member of staff opened the door for me at Wesley's House. "
7399,"The venue has one of the few Changing Places Toilets in the area, however this was blocked by the table taking contact details at the main entrance, so did not view, plenty of helpful staff, so am sure would only take a moment to enable access. Another accessible toilet available, clean , roomy, and plenty of room for chair and carer"
7400,"This was a pre-arranged outing with Charlie, the warden. She wanted to check the accessibility of a new footpath leading from the visitor centre to the Layer Breton Causeway, where the majority of  the most interesting birds are seen. The route is circular and is 3.5 miles. At the moment it is only possible to complete about 50% of the route, but there are plans to make the rest accessible. The route took 1hr30 mins and was peaceful  and rather beautiful. The footpath is well signposted and comfortable to negotiate on my scooter. The path is wide enough for anyone accompanying a wheelchair user to walk alongside."
7401,The staff were  friendly and very helpful
7402,"As you come in, there is step-free access, with a slight ramp to get in - the door is power-assisted. There is a slight tight squeeze to get through the bar to get to the cinema - and although I managed, I have a small manual wheelchair so larger manual, scooters or powerchairs may struggle. From then on, all doors are power-assisted and there are also lots of grab bars nearby. The signage is relatively high up but is easily accessible and all signs are also in braille. There is an induction loop in the Box Office and Tyneside Bar. There is lots of comfortable seating in each room to take a rest on if needed (e.g. on each level by toilets, near the entrance of each screen etc.). The lift accesses all floors and is spacious enough, with a mirror and grab bar, as well as a foldable seat - which I imagine would be great for anyone who struggled with their mobility who didn't have a wheelchair or scooter.  "
7403,"There was an accessible toilet, and standard toilets.  I did not use these so am unable to comment further."
7404,"I don't know if there was an accessible loo in the restaurant but in the bedroom, the very spacious bathroom had some adaptations. The toilet had a grab rail to the left as you sit on it and the shower had one grab rail and a movable stool. You can see from the photos that the shower gel dispenser is too high to be reached from a sitting position and the tiled floor was very slippery but there was a bath mat for the floor amongst the pile of lovely fluffy towels they provided which solved the problem."
7405,A large and very well maintained accessible loo with plenty of room for a wheelchair and a carer if necessary.
7406,3 accessible parking bays - paved and a paved pathway to the door (25 metres).
7407,Plenty of onsite parking. At Front two bays close to a ramp to front door.
7408,"This is a wonderful attraction and ideal for wheelchair and scooters, however contrary to some other comments you may have to ask to be directed to wheelchair parking , not all attendants seem aware of them. Also you may be charged for parking but it is well worth it. Most important , if you enjoy The Kelpies you will absolutely love the Falkirk Wheel also on the canal two miles away. Wheelchair accessible and a breathtaking view from the boat when on the Wheel. Don't miss it !"
7409,"the trains are regular to Glasgow, I dont know about car parking but I think the buses are regular to here"
7410,We were able to park just outside entrance to our room.
7411,We managed to obtain a disabled parking place which was near to the entrance.
7412,"Apart from buying my ticket for St Mary's and showing my ticket at the entrance I didn't interact with anyone. However, my brief experiences were fine. Everyone spoke English."
7413,"I haven't been here for years, but after a great day out, certainly keen to go back.  In an original school building (designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh), the museum gives information about the history of schooling/education and Glasgow's culture.  You can walk through the school corridors, have a lesson in a classroom, play traditional games."
7414,"Klezmer Hois is a restaurant which was an old former mikveh - a ritual Jewish bath house. At 8pm every evening there is a Jewish music concert performed in one of the restaurants rooms. Admission to the concert room has an additional surcharge on top of the price of the food (an extra  30zł in 2019), however for something special, this was relatively inexpensive and provided an enjoyable, special and relaxing night out. "
7415,Great! Our party had 3 powerchair users in it so we had booked ahead and asked for a table with extra space - which we certainly got! Slight lip on door but otherwise level access.  There's a whole other floor upstairs with separate bar etc.
7416,"Confused as the food was 5 star but my experience was not. I use crutches or a wheelchair and was so glad I was using my crutches. On arrival the   Table was not ready and we were told to take a seat at the bar - high stools not too suitable for the disabled. Table was ready and was down a flight of stairs.Once down (thankfully there we folk in our group to assist) I enquired as to the location of the disabled toilet and you’ve guessed it, it was up the stairs! Or I could use a normal cubicle. Great meal, service and experience for the able bodied not so much for the disabled making me really confused."
7417,"Having stayed in this hotel before, we knew what to expect and were not disappointed. Having paid in advance, we got a reasonable rate.  Whilst I realize it may be tied in with demand, but I still find it odd that the three nights we stayed, each was charged at a different rate, with the Wednesday night being £11.50 more expensive than the Friday night.  The only other comment I would make at this point is that when I went to book online, a double wheelchair accessible room was not available yet on phoning the hotel direct, such a room was. Checking in was swift and we were soon into room 206, the same room that we had on a previous stay.   The room was very spacious, with lots of room to get around the bed.   Breakfast was more than adequate, with a varied selection of cereals, fruit, pastries on offer as well as oranges juice and hot drinks. The  downsides  of our stay (and there has to be some) was that we found the bed to be of the soft side and one of the bath towels has seen better days as a hole had appeared where it was very worn.    My main bugbear was the noise by other guests in the corridors and adjacent room at various times of the day and night. Sadly this seems to be the norm in hotels these days or perhaps it is just me getting old and less tollerant. If require a hotel for either shopping or visiting tourist attractions, this hotel is very well located.  A ten minute walk takes you up to the main shopping areas of the city with a similar time to get over to the Discovery or Unicorn.  Should we be back to Dundee in the future, we shall certainly consider using the Holiday Express Inn Dundee."
7418,"Accessible, very good, rails, height, non slip floor etc."
7419,2 toilets available but not that easy to get to and one was not signposted. Quite small. No mirrors or hooks for coat or handbag.
7420,"A lift goes from the car-park directly into the doctors building.  Or, if not using the car-park/lift, there are both stairs and a ramp at the front door.  On arrival you can use a computer screen on the wall to confirm you have arrived for your appointment, or tell the receptionist at the desk. Have noticed it is quite a high desk, with no lowered section, so this could make it more difficult for some people if in a wheelchair and especially if having a private conversation.  Waiting room is large and has room to move in.  The Doctors/Nurses come out of consulting rooms and call out the name of their next patient - although could be missed by someone with hearing difficulties, the doctors do usually come into the waiting room and have quick look about if no-one responds to their first call, so I expect they would make sure the person/patient understood.  Most appointments need to be booked on the day you are going - it can be difficult to get through on the phone at this time. However an online system has recently been introduced and some people may prefer that. You can also go in person at 8am ( when the practice opens) to make an appointment for that day"
7421,"The staff were incredibly friendly & polite, providing rapid table service & being unphased by the wheelchair. They spoke to both myself & my husband."
7422,The staff were very busy but also friendly and are happy to help people look for products within the store if you require help or assistance.
7423,"It was clean and tidy, with enough space for me to manoeuvre very comfortably. However, I have a fairly compact manual chair, so I think someone in a larger or powerchair might find it a bit tight. The door is very light, the doorway large, and all usual grab rails were present, as was a red cord dangling freely to the floor. "
7424,"The hallway to the disabled toilets was very narrow and had very little room to turn in. There was a coded padlock on the disabled toilet that only a manager knew the combination to. When the manager opened the door it was full of storage. There was a basket in the doorway which because of the sink I couldn't push it out the way and couldn't fit in the door, there were 4 very large speakers stacked in there and some other things that meant I couldn't use it. The manager had to come back and empty out the room for me."
7425,Passengers can be dropped off right outside the main entrance with parking adjacent.  Leuchie has it's own accessible mini-bus and wheelchair-accessible cars.
7426,Good staff.
7427,"Disabled access to shop via lift, 2 lifts available and large enough for sewveral chairs and to turn around in, but the buttons are not easy to press. However, mobility scooters partly blocking access to lift.  Plenty of space in the shop, wide aisles without stands cluttering them.  Space for wheelchairs and trolleys.  Nice and quiet on Monday afternoon.  Several self-service checkouts, with money slots low down, however, entrance and exit to them was tight for wheelchairs. All freezers see through."
7428,Bowes Museum is a delight . It is steeped in history and has connections with the Bowes Lyon family. The displays  are well displayed and easily accessed by wheelchair users. Lift to all floors and a lovely cafe. Staff are very helpful and could not be faulted when I went for a day out.   There is disabled parking at the rear of the premises and the accessible entrance is close by.  You have to ring the bell at the accessible entrance to have the door opened for you but it worked fine.  Bowes Museum also houses special events which are advertised on its  website and advertising in local papers. 
7429,The disabled access is very good as the garden centre is all on one level.
7430,"I arrived under my own steam, or should I say power, using my powerchair. There is Blue Badge parking in St. Clair Street and a separate area for HDSA members as well as away fans. You can get more information on the HDSA website at www.hdsa.org.uk"
7431,"The recent make-over of Abbotsford House has made the two walled gardens and almost the whole of the public parts of the house fully wheelchair accessible, and includes a fully accessible modern visitor centre with restaurant, shop and exhibition. Only the chapel and the parkland between the house and the Tweed are not wheelchair accessible."
7432,"Very interesting with a great variety of top class plants on sale.  As you enter, there is a stand with a fabulous display of top quality plants and good variety,  and a little further into the shop it has a good display of artificial ones, which you can’t tell are artificial at a quick glance. Through double doors takes you outside to the outdoor plants in excellent condition, such a good variety again, a pleasure to walk around. Another interesting hall is the Hobby craft area. It’s huge, but whatever your hobby or craft you will be able to get it there. It’s fascinating to wander through looking at things from paint to wool.  We really recommend you visiting, it’s a top class centre."
7433,"Great !!     I stayed in the cottages for one week with my sister who has MS and uses wheelchair. The cottages are very spacious, with great support equipment ranging from air flow mattress, clos-o-mat toilet, shower trolley, mobile hoist, ceiling tracking hoist, electric profiling bed etc"
7434,Disable toilets available with radar key
7435,The toilet is a good size and well maintained.
7436,"The toilets have recently been refurbished and we had 2 visits, on the 1st the disabled toilet was busy and a centre employee suggested we use 1 of the 2 baby facilities this was huge and bright and although the toilet seat was a little low it was perfect for my wife's needs. On the second visit we used the disabled toilet and although it has been refurbished to a high standard it is very small to get a powered chair in, get the door closed and transfer to the toilet.  This is very disappointing"
7437,"At the Water of Leith Visitor Centre. Down a corridor. The person on duty was very helpful indeed - opening doors for us and showing us where the accessible toilet is. The accessible toilet is on the small side, but manageable."
7438,"Theatre staff very attentive. Offered help without me needing to ask. Bars staff got chair for mum as standing and waiting difficult for her. Michael introduced himself to us and we felt well looked after. Friendly, chatty and good sense of humour, even bought our drinks to us seats during the interval!"
7439,the view sitting outside by the river
7440,"We entered the hotel from inside Central Station. The main entrance had two steps. There were two sets of double doors to allow you to enter the reception. The doors were heavy with no auto door entry. Reception is manned 24 hours daily. There was plenty of seating in the reception area. There were lifts to all floors.  To enter the restaurant you take the lift to level E and then along a corridor there are steps to take you down to the restaurant. . There is also a lift , however it was out of order on our visit. We were reassured it would be fixed by the end of the day. This was clearly signposted. There is access to the restaurant from Hope Street, however this door is locked until 4 pm. It would be of benefit to call in advance. There is also a small step (around 2 inches) at this entrance. "
7441,"This is not just an accessible hotel but an accessible holiday. Everything you could need can be provided from equipment to wheelchair adapted pick up from the airport and excursions. Hannah, Adrian and their staff know what is needed and they provide it. The food is exceptional and the views spectacular."
7442,Parking is right outside the disabled gate at the same level nice and wide
7443,Access was straightforward for us.  There is a large lift on the right hand side as you go into the venue.
7444,Popped into Grainger Market to escape the rain - and found a treasure trove of stalls and small shops!
7445,It is all on one level but the main door is quite heavy so bring someone with you. The lesson is the staff see you trying to open the door they do leap into action to help.
7446,"Was pretty impressed with the access in this shop. It was very well adapted for wheelchair users in particular. There is a customer lift beside the staircase leading to the upper level, automatic doors into the shop, and a dropped counter at the checkout."
7447,Ships and ferries go into Zeebrugge and you take a transfer to Bruges but Bruges being a medieval city is not easy on the wheels. We went to Blankenberg which is a post war city and very accessible. There is a good big beach and pier with coffee house. The coffee house has a lift to the Terace Bar. 
7448,The restaurant is situated in the centre of town .  It was busy with a good atmosphere and the service was great .  The menu and specials board had a great selection of fish to order from. Unfortunately access for wheelchair users is terrible.  For more details read further on in the review .
7449,A friendly wheelchair accessible cafe with a beautiful overlooking Rowntree Park.
7450,"Everyone was very friendly and encouraging. There were staff at the bottom of each of the lifts and some others around the place. We asked for directions/advice a few times, and each person we spoke to was helpful."
7451,Blue badge parking close to the Centre (about 50 yards). You could drop off even closer.
7452,Undercover parking this is amazing if the weather is bad 
7453,Public Transport in Germany is very good for wheelchair users so no complaints there.Goetheplatz on the U3 line is the closest to the venue.
7454,"If I drove to the multi-story carpark they would have disabled parking and they also have a bridge to get up with no stairs for wheelchairs or peaks. The nearest train station is across the road from the rivergate shopping centre, the nearest bus stop is outside primark."
7455,"There is an accessible toilet which is spacious, has grab rails and an emergency cord which reached to the ground. It was clean and tidy. When I walked in it smelt like it had recently been cleaned.  A Changing Places toilet is available in King's Cross Railway Station. "
7456,There was adequate room for me to get my buggy about and fond the information boards of the cars at a good height.
7457,"My room (#1) had a walk-in shower in a large bathroom; the room itself had excellent space for equipment storage, lots of suitcases, etc. However, shower and doorways were probably not large enough to take a wheelchair. There were no handles around the room.  If you go all the way up the drive in a car (rather than stopping at the parking) rooms, restaurant, reception and two terraces are all on one level. The pool is down a steep slope, but electric wheelchairs/buggies might manage it; once there, there are wide steps into the pool and even a submerged bench."
7458,"Car park just across the road with a walkway and lift. Flat entrance into hydro, lift to floor with accessible seats. Good view from accessible seating, although this might be different if at a concert with the people in front standing."
7459,"Great food, cocktails, brunch with wheelchair access"
7460,"I got a taxi to Elgin Cathedral so I can't comment too much on the parking. However, I do know that on-street parking is available several metres from the cathedral. Visitors can be dropped off at the entrance."
7461,Nice large clean toilets. Easy to get in an out of.
7462,"There is an accessible toilet in toilet in the car park next to the bus stop and tourist information office. the toilet had 1 grab rail, no emergency alarm and the toilet seat was missing. However it was clean."
7463,Cobbled surfaces didn't make for the easiest of visits.  There may have been level access to the restaurant but we didn't find it.  Signage wasn't abundant or clear
7464,Non existent but there are buses into the centre of Oxford which has a lot of pedestrian and wheelchair accessible streets. 
7465,All the staff were very helpful and made the visit an experience to be repeated as soon as possible.
7466,A reasonable size for a person who can stand but tight to point of being un-usable if on wheels. 
7467,"The church is located near the centre of Bracknell & is easily accessible by road, rail & bus, being only a few minutes from both the bus & rail stations. The church has two bulidings; the main building (Kerith Centre) is fully accessible to the ground floor, but has no lift access to the first floor. The ancillary building (K2) is fully accessible to both ground and first floors."
7468,"Our holiday was a Western Mediterranean Cruise on board the fantastic P&O Britannia. Leaving from Southampton we visited Gibraltar, Cartagena, Barcelona, Cadiz, Palma and Lisbon. Before leaving, to make life easier for ourselves we got our luggage uplifted a few days prior to our cruise by the Baggage Handling Company (I would really recommend this service) who transported our baggage to Southampton and the next time we saw it was on board. We done this so all we had to carry was hand luggage as I also got them to take my manual chair just in case it was needed as I didn't know how accessible places would be for my powered chair. The cruise terminal at Southampton had parking directly outside the terminal but we arrived by accessible taxi which dropped us off at the door. Inside was very accessible for wheelchairs with good toilets and ramped access all the way onto the Ship. The staff were very helpful. Onboard the ship was very accessible but my only negative is the lifts. You can at times wait a while. This is more down to people who don't really need them using them all the time with no consideration to others. The accessible cabins were very spacious and the accessible public toilets were also a good size. Overall, all areas onboard were accessible in the wheelchair. One of the pools on deck even had a hoist chair to transfer you in and out of the pool. Staff everywhere onboard were exceptional always very attentive and making sure everything was OK. Getting off at each port was a worry for me, but it needn't have been. There are limited amount of accessible excursions you can book either onboard or before you go, although a cheaper way to do it is by doing your own thing. Other cruises I have been on, if you're not booked on an excursion, you have just got to hope the terminal is  within walking distance of the city centre, or there are accessible taxis you can get as there have never been accessible shuttle buses taking you into the centre. but at each port, apart from the ones where the port is right in the city centre, they laid on accessible shuttle buses to take you to a central drop off and pickup point throughout the day. Once there we generally took a sightseeing tour bus which in each of the cities we visited were accessible and gave you the opportunity to get to know the city and took you to the main attractions at a fraction of the cost of  the cruise excursions. Gibraltar - to be honest I didn't rate Gibraltar too much. I tried looking for an accessible public toilet and found one, only to find that the door opens inward and once in, you can't actually close the door.  Cartagena - a beautiful little place that is quite accessible. The roman theatre museum is a great place to go. The museum itself is accessible then there is the ramp that takes you out to the top of the amphitheater looking down. The first time I've ever had the chance to see such a thing! The city has Lots of places to eat and drink that you can access either by the table service on the pavements or inside. Again everyone was very helpful and friendly. Cadiz - another stunning place worth a visit, probably my favourite place of the trip. Found restaurants and hotels handy for accessible toilets. When we got off the ship in Cadiz we were handed a map of the centre and it had walking routes , one of which was wheelchair accessible.  Palma - lots of interesting places but just wandered around the cathedral area of the city and found accessible hotel for a lovely tapas. Barcelona was fantastic and the bus tour was great. A place I would love to go back to for longer. We also used the underground there as most stations are accessible. A handy tip is the first carriage and last carriage of the train are the accessible carriages so it's best to wait at either end of the platform. I think it is marked on the platform where to wait for wheelchairs. Lisbon was a nice city to visit, again with an accessible tour bus. We just went on the tour then came back after having a coffee. Everything seemed so much more spread out in this city compared to the others."
7469,do not use so cannot really comment
7470,Very well thought out and very efficient visit with staff that were really helpful. The overall process was pretty stress free.
7471,"Could not be better, outside the front door and on smooth tarmac."
7472,The Quay is a great place to hangout on a weekend morning... You can go out on the 'causewayside' as far as the eye can see. You can also get to the wildfowl 'pond' and see nature in action.
7473,"There is no parking in closest proximity, but the buses stop just outside the cafe."
7474,being able to get round everywhere in my chair
7475,The entrance closest to the parking lot has stairs and no ramp. Staff will usually come out to the parking lot or to the station to help customers into the hotel.
7476,Train station located in the city centre of Glasgow. Many different train routes that take you all around Glasgow and surrounding areas. Frequent cross country trains also.
7477,"The cafe can be accessed by using a different ramps within the development, but it is a nice trip!   There is no lib on door, the cafe is mostly made of high tables which can be annoying, but outside they had lower tables. "
7478,"For an old and historic building, access was really good. The front doors have a push-button and then open themselves. The entrance is flat.  When inside, there are ramps wherever there are a few steps, and there is a lift to go to the different floors.  Corridors are all wide, and I think access would be fine to most areas. "
7479,Perfect for wheelchairs and motor scooters.  But it does not 'feel' disabled.  Everyone would be comfortable here.
7480,The staff are all volunteers and the attention to detail and TLC that's been put into the museum reflects an impressive level of devotion. The staff we saw were genuinely happy that we were visiting their museum!
7481,"I have never been to a venue with better, kinder, prompt, pro-active and attentive staff. It was as though I wasn't disabled."
7482,"As mentioned above, staff ignored the doorbell and I waited outside for several minutes. The person who eventually brought the ramp to me told me that he wasn't at all surprised that the staff didn't hear the doorbell, as they never (in his opinion) pay any attention to it. This one-star rating for staff is on the generous side."
7483,We walked there so not sure.
7484,"The people running the guided tour were extremely friendly, informative and helpful . One of the ladies with the CWGC called Sehar gave me a one to one guided tour, so that I wouldn’t miss out on anything, making for an interesting and informative visit which I very much enjoyed, so special thanks to her."
7485,Their accessible loo needs a radar key. Generally in okay repair. Has grab rails and is Generally tidy. It's also a baby changing unit which does take up a fair amount of space when it's down.
7486,"We found ordinary toilets which were nice and clean, but cubicles were rather narrow, so had to leave wheelchair outside and walk in, however, by chance we did see disabled toilet later on near to reception desk, but a bit late then."
7487,"Easy to find, enough room to turn around, grab bars are good. Red cord is often tied up as baby changing is also in there."
7488,"There is both steps with handrails or a ramp to the entrance of Gare du Sud. The entrance door was already open so I could walk right through. Once inside their is a foyer with a library and an exhibition space, but I didn't look at these. Instead I walked into the main hall with its food court. There are free standing tables and chairs in the centre and round the edges of the room are food stalls. The stalls are at standing height.  There is also a mezzanine level which is accessible by stairs with handrails or a lift. The upper floor has some more food stalls as well as some small shops selling vintage clothing and local produce. "
7489,Directly beside the main road. Disabled parking close to the entry office. Entry is free to everyone. Mainline train station at Kingussie is three miles from the venue. Main line Bus service close by.
7490,"This is such a gem of a place.  As the mum/carer of a wheelchair user, it is so nice to take a break in somewhere which has excellent facilities but which feels and looks like a home.  Aisle barn is beautifully 'done' to high specifications - originally adapted and renovated for the owner's father, a wheelchair user, it has clever touches - lowered kitchen units and carefully positioned for ease of use white goods,  a LOLA certified lifts takes you to the master bedroom (which has a with super-king sized bed and neat hoisting system) & accessible bathroom (which has an accessible flower AND a huge bath!), and the second guest bedroom also has its own en suite shower room.  Aisle Barn has 2 lovely gardens and you can also visit the grounds of the main house and go down to the private lake (200m away) to fish if you so wish. There is separate (not wheelchair friendly) accommodation for 2-4 others to join you during your stay. The owners were really welcoming and couldn't have been more helpful.  This area of Somerset is quite quiet but definitely worth exploring. We visited some of the beautiful local towns, the Wellington Memorial and drove over Exmoor during our all-to-short stay.  We will be back!"
7491,Plenty of parking and you can get a bus or taxi straight from Aviemore train station to the hotel. 
7492,"The Heather Gems is full accessible all on the one level, no steps , plenty of room to move a wheelchair around."
7493,Depending on what bus route you use there are 3 bus stops located near the fire station. One disabled pay at end of ramp. 
7494,"Wide door, large room fully equipped. Room to maneuver and transfer from a wheelchair. Fixed and fold down rails."
7495,helpful staff especially as we had a group of children with a range of conditions.
7496,Please see in my review
7497,Virtually outside the entrance
7498,"While this is an excellent venue for children and families, it is dire for anyone with mobility problems. No signage to disabled parking should have been a clue that this place is not suitable for anyone in a wheelchair or mobility scooter. Even the level paths are heavily gravelled and not suitable for any walking aids."
7499,"There are a number of car parks to choose from and many trails/paths. So you can make your outing as long or short as you like. Some of the gradients are a bit steep given the location but there are some gentle routes following the valley contours along the side of the beck. There are also off road cycling routes here - make sure you stay off these! You'll need a mobility scooter or robust powered wheelchair.  We went from the car park at the south end nr Lunton Hill and followed the forest drive through to the visitor centre (cafe, loos) at the north end. We took a small detour along Bedburn Beck which was a footpath but easily accessed.  It was about 7 miles and 3.5 hours round trip."
7500,"We were staying in Bath at the Indigo Hotel (review submitted) and had bought my bike and also my husband's Stricker handcycle attachment for his wheelchair along in our car.  The Bath to Bristol Railway Path is a 13 mile route on the national cycle network.  We cycled from our hotel through the town, which was a bit busy and found a path next to the river which we were able to cycle along.  There were a couple of path closures due to repairs and we followed the diversion signs which took us back onto the river path.  The Bath to Bristol railway path starts at Brassmill Lane and when cycling along the river you will see the blue signs which state that the path starts in 500 yards and you have to go along a quiet road to get there.  Once on the railway path its all flat and wide and takes you through lovely countryside and over bridges.  You know you are on the right track as there are quite a few cyclists enjoying the route but it wasn't over busy. We didn.t do the whole route this time but will definately come back to go to Bristol and back next time."
7501,"I visit Disneyland Paris several times a year with my annual pass and always choose to stay onsite in a hotel that is within short walking distance to the parks.  Arriving by Eurostar when you are in a wheelchair is very easy due to the excellent assistance and the fact you are right in the centre of Disneyland, so no additional transfers are needed. You can use the Disney Hotels Bus Service instead of walking; however you have to make yourself known otherwise you just get lost in the crowd and the driver will happily leave you behind!  The hotels staff were very accommodating; the room itself was extremely accessible and the bathroom was very well equipped. The swimming pool was also very well equipped for wheelchair users, which was a pleasant surprise!  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a wheelchair friendly break filled with magic!"
7502,"The girl in the shop (Kayleigh) was incredibly helpful and friendly, she was cheerful and just seemed happy to go above and beyond to assist, she made us feel welcome and looked after! The staff in the cafe were also friendly, but it looked like they were ready to close at 4 despite there being about 4 other tables of people still there. "
7503,This branch of Wetherspoons is very accessible it has a large entrance and plenty of space to manoeuvre around tables.
7504,"There is a car park beside the coffee shop with plenty disabled car parking spaces. Personally, I travelled via the train and Dundee train station is directly opposite the coffee shop. "
7505,"Bit bit of of the way, the car park from Falkirk Wheel is about a four minute walk, I think."
7506,"There is a disabled space for 1 car beside museum. Behind the museum is North St car park and also West St car park, both of which are easy to access from museum."
7507,Staff are lovely and could not be more obliging.
7508,"Level access, plenty of space in the area for one or two wheelchairs."
7509,This is a new venture by the Salvation Army and is part training facility and part exhibition covering the story of the song written by John Lennon Strawberry fields for ever.  The exhibition is interactive and takes you through the story around the song and John Lennon who used to climb over the wall to play football. The exhibition looks at the children's home that was on the site and you will see pictures of the home as well. There is also a garden area with very long ramps that make it easy to go round the garden in one area you will find the original Red Gates in a spot as near to there original location as can be due to redevelopment in the area.  The interactive part continues in the garden and also has music written by John Lennon etc. The venue also has a café that is employing people with a range of disabilities to give them training and support. Of course there is also a shop as you would expect with these type of exhibitions . This venue only opened around 8 weeks ago however I am sure it will be come very popular by the time Spring Summer 2020 comes along
7510,Good sized toilet with plenty grab rails. Very clean.
7511,"As others have said, the cathedral is really interesting and they have put ramps in to make it as accessible as possible. If you can manage a few steps and then sit down I think just about every where can be seen.   We joined a group for a tour and it was worth it. Then there's a lift to get down to the cafe and loo  "
7512,There is no entrance where it is easy for most wheelchair users to get in or out. There is no accessible toilet. Not recommended for wheelchair users unless you're a manual wheelchair user with the ability to bounce energetically over big hump-steps.
7513,Really good wheelchair spot so great view of the show. Staff member at front door helped us to seats and offered to bring drinks at the interval.
7514,Helpful and understanding staff
7515,"An accessible café tearooms, with shop attached overlooking BHS gardens. Lovely setting, amazing food and drinks and very friendly staff. Disabled bay parking just outside the entrance. Lots to see, do and eat! Will return with my grandma who uses a wheelchair, she will love it!"
7516,"There was ample parking at the side of our cottage on tarmac, there is more parking to the rear of the cottages but this is on small gravel, there are bus stops nearby, but the venue is just over 3 miles from the village of Rhayader. There is a garage with Spar and Greggs cafe about a hundred yards away."
7517,"A wonderful welcoming pub that serves delicious home cooked food. During our visit it was evident that the staff were extremely accommodating and polite, showing understanding where necessary. Although the front entrance of the pub has a step leading up to the door there is disabled access towards the rear of the building through the beer garden which is adjacent to the car park. Throughout the pub there is ample space to manoeuvre wheelchairs and sports a spacious disabled toilet."
7518,Saltburn is a lovely seaside town with nice independent shops. The seafront is level as is the pier and the cliff funicular is wheelchair accessible
7519,The staff member there was very helpful and was easy to find whenever we needed her.
7520,"Good sized toilets , wide doors, hand rails.Only issue was the doors are really heavy"
7521,Staff are tremendous but you wont need them for much because the emerites arena is fantastic.
7522,The Disabled toilets at Blackpool FC are really big to get into and the room was very spacious.
7523,Staff very helpful and polite
7524,"Driving to the airport was simple, well sign posted.  We opted for surface car parking, again well signposted to the disabled bay which there was a good amount of and well spaced out."
7525,Youngish gentleman served us. Attentive without being pushy. Could noit be moire helpful.
7526,Very pleasant friendly and helpful particularly the manager.
7527,Trains buses and public car parks all available. 
7528,There is a car park with many disabled parking spaces.
7529,"Access was easy into the restaurant it’s partly on one level. There are steps to other levels but having said that. The main flat area has plenty of space for disabled guests . There are pictures for the toilets as well as writing . Some pictures on the walls of various cuts of meat are also in shown in sign language using pictures for the words. There was plenty of signage about the current covid situation .,"
7530,There is a large accessible toilet within the station which I believe you have to ask a key for at the desk. It is only on platform one however!
7531,"Traditional pub serving good pub food and local Harvey's ales in the pretty 1066 country village of Burwash with beautiful views from the garden over the Weald. Pub is not accessible from the main doors at the front, but there is step free access into the bar and large function room at the back through the car park and a very decent (brand new looking) disabled toilet."
7532,The toilet is to the left of the bar and round a corner. It is awkward to get to if the place is busy as there is a large sofa along the corridor wall. The toilet inside has a great amount of room and is clean. The handrail was not securely screwed to the wall however which could have been extremely dangerous.
7533,Access is excellent and staff very helpful. We've made regular visits to the cafe as its a great accessible meeting point as well as having good coffee and cake (I'd recommend the lemon cake!).  Love the massive glass lift and staff are very friendly and helpful too.
7534,Staff were friendly and offered us a free sample of delicious cake 
7535,We found the staff at reception and at breakfast both helpful and polite
7536,All helpful and friendly.
7537,Access to all areas
7538,"I was extremely impressed by the staff member Stuart who showed me around the facilities. He was very reassuring, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about me using the equipment. I got the feeling that he was genuinely proud of how they managed to make such an old building so accessible. Fantastic customer service all round."
7539,"Being in 'the middle of nowhere' (Bolzano is 40 minutes away), you need to arrive and go anywhere by road.   But there is a car park outside the hotel - not large but perfectly adequate."
7540,"Accessible toilets easy to find. Enough space to manoeuvre myself and a power chair user. Also a changing places disabled toilet. All toilets kept very clean, very good access with changing places toilet!  "
7541,"It was very clean, lots of space. Suitable grab bars , alarm pull. No places to change adults except the floor. "
7542,"Toilets all over the site and a good number of accessible ones. All clean, well sized and equipped. "
7543,"No steps - no kerbs, wide doors so easy to just manoeuvre wheelchair in or sit on terrace.  Masses of room inside for wheelchair."
7544,We only encountered the staff of Cafe Tiki. They were charming and helpful.
7545,"As stated above, the entrance to the students union has disabled access buttons to press in order for the doors to open automatically. The students union is all on one level, however, to get to the offices upstairs there is no disabled access, there are stairs. The bar area is very spacious and furniture can easily be moved."
7546,Small ramp (bump really) from car park to path to entrance. Door to negotiate but wide. Level inside - flagstones. Small lip between some seating areas but very smooth.  Plenty of room to manoeuvre. Some areas had carpet.
7547,All staff that I interacted with during my visit were very friendly. A staff member came out with my helper to let me know how long I’d have to wait for a table and then later came and found us outside when our table was ready to help me to the accessible entrance.
7548,"Restaurant manager was very friendly and willing, training a young waitress."
7549,Small ramp leads into restaurant.
7550,Flat parking immediately outside front door so getting a wheelchair out of the car and into the cottage is a doddle.
7551,"The disabled access entrance is available on Killermont Street. There are two platform lifts giving access (from either side of the staircase in the entrance hall).   Once inside the main area of the concert hall, there is various entrance points for disabled access, depending on where you are to be seated. We were on the 1st floor, so used a second lift to get access to our seats."
7552,The staff seem to be temporary students or at least they change staff a lot. The waiting staff are so helpful and nice. They always seem to know when you've finished and want to order more food. The manager is helpful and sometimes does waiting. I was a bit annoyed once as I took my children before 5pm when it's meant to be free for kids to eat. I asked for my bill at ten to five and she brought it over after 5pm and charged me for them even though the restaurant was empty so I dont know what the delay was. Usually when we ask for the bill it arrives within 30 seconds. I asked the waiting staff if they recieve 100% of their tips and they do but most of them decline tips.
7553,There was 1 member of staff checking face masks when we entered the store and no hand sanitiser next to the baskets. The aisles didn’t have arrows and many didn’t have 2m markers. The queueing system even after all these months still has everyone lined up along the bottom of the aisles so it is not possible to distance as you come out of the aisles. Overall I would say I didn’t feel COVID safe and it felt like there were too many people in the store and round the tills.
7554,Not that good for disabled access a food kiosk is inaccessible to wheelchair/mobility scooter users due to the lack of a slope also an amusement arcade was the same I’ve attached a photo to show the steep slope with a big drop that would tip anyone out of thier mobility aid. 
7555,"I didn't use the accessible toilet while I was there, as it is mentioned on their website plus someone did a TA review in July 2017 confirming this."
7556,"We genuinely only visited this place because it was reviewed on Euan's Guide, and we were glad we did. It's not an easy experience to learn in detail about Bloody Sunday, but it's very worthwhile, and the level access and space around the displays in this small museum mean that wheelchair users feel welcome.  "
7557,"The starting and finishing point for Le Petit Train de Cannes is on La Croisette near Palais des Festivals.  The train station is about a 10 minute walk away, and it's on a slight slope down from the station to the sea front. There are also a number of buses that run along La Croisette or stop nearby. Sorry unable to comment about car parking, but assume it would be expensive given the location."
7558,"Multiple floors of accessible shops, including my favourite: a Lego store! On the 2nd floor, there are restaurants and well thought out accessible toilets."
7559,"There is no disabled access, but the venue was made as accessible as possible to meet my needs."
7560,All disabled seating is in boxes upstairs. The boxes are nice with plenty of seats for friends and family to sit with wheelchair user. However there is only one lift which can only accommodate one wheelchair and carer at a time so can take a while
7561,Does have disabled parking but we was unable to get a disabled space as they were all taken up. it’s free parking for blue badge holders.
7562,Wheelchair ramp upto front door. The ramp has a dogleg turn in it which wouldnt be suitable for a motability scooter. Wheelchair ramp at the back entrance from the Hotel car park. Only 1 disabled toilet/baby changing room. This is between the bar and restraunt and is at the end of a sloping corridor....so you may need a friend to wheel you back up although there is usually a friendly member of staff willing to help!
7563,"Staff in the hotel are most accommodating and nothing is too much trouble.   The hotel has level access throughout the ground floor, with wide corridors between all areas."
7564,i drove in car. as mentioned in other posts parking is plentiful and adjacent to the accommodation. was glad of my sat nav to find the cottages in the dark. a real joy driving along the country lanes.
7565,"Over in the Mallory Court purpose built extension block of orchard House, we found the bedrooms to be cosy and comfortable, with the added blessing of the house having one disabled room, it’s on the first floor, with a purpose built lift available, and the block is set amoung a number of tree top views in glorious grounds, and here stands the state of the arts Evan Spa, which offers you a luxurious Spa break where you will most certainly be spoilt, with its lovely swimming pool, an outdoor  vitality pool, an ideal sauna, hydro pool, and up to date Gym facility. You will even find an outdoor tennis court and other outdoor active sports courts, and grounds that will delight young and old alike, and we found the terrace area to be a real sun trap, even on a cold but sunny late March day.  OUR REVIEW Mallory Court Country House hotel is an absolute delight (photo 1) well maintained, with a wide open frontage that is so inviting. The Orchard House extension is a little way from the main house, but with easy parking, and pleasant walk to reach them entrances, with the bedrooms for this part at the front of the block (photo 2) the disabled room is on the first floor, with a lift available. Round at the rear you will find the entry into the Spa and Gym, (3) which is a reasonable sized Gym, beautifully kept and very clean (4) with all modern equipment (5).  There is plenty of seating available (6) as needed, and a lovely little cafe area (7) which offersclightvrefreshments and drinks.  The pool is very nice, not to big, but warm and cosy as you unwind (photo 8) and there is a delightful terrace garden, with sun loungers and rattan seating and a small heated vitality pool, (9) and it is truly a sun trap, so popular a place to sit and enjoy  after your dip. Alongside the extension are well kept gardens (10) overlooking the tennis court (11).  A walk back towards main Mallory Court hotel takes you along through gardens (12) With the main plants being fragrant roses, (13) and will lead you towards the other extension of Kings court (14) which is used for business meetings, shows and special events, but to the rear there are again garden areas to view (15) but for the lawn there are steps. Mind you, there are well maintained gardens to see (16) the hedges beautifully maintained (17) and later on in the season, the herb garden will be full of herbs they use in the restaurant. (18). This was a truly delightful visit for us.  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS Mallory Court is well worth a visit, or a stay, the Orchard House has made it possible for disabled to stay, and experience this delightful hotel. We hope you have read all three parts we have reviewed for you, and would highly recommend this hotel, even if the main house has areas disabled cannot enjoy to the full, but the rest is well rewarding enough."
7566,"The railway station is a major transport hub, as well as trains, there is an accessible tube station serving several lines. There are also several bus routes that serve the station and stop outside the entrance or close by."
7567,"Great accessible toilet on ground floor, and accessible room.  Good space to manoeuvre Very clean.  Definitely space for carer."
7568,Fab! We were directed to a great accessible box office at which there was no queue. When we then went to join the queue to board the London Eye we were escorted to the front of the line. It was also surprisingly easy to board the 'pods' themselves - staff put a sturdy ramp down and you can easy wheel on and off.
7569,"Spacious, has all of the correct hand rails etc. However slightly dated.   It's quite a way to go to (there are several sets of automatic doors that you need to go through to access the toilet)."
7570,For the age of the vessel they have done a great job with the toilet. Just basics of accessible toilet but well done. 
7571,The Broma café has its own large car park with disabled parking spaces and for those using public transport the bus stops are just outside the venue.
7572,"Limited number of disabled parking spaces available, however these spaces are the closest to the entrance giving those that require the spaces priority in accessing the shop. There is a bus stop just outside the shop as well."
7573,"We have visited many times prior to me becoming a wheelchair user. The access has massively improved over the years and I was pleased to be able to access ALL facilities, craft rooms, dining/bar areas and kid’s activities. Long ramps meant that there wasn’t many steep ramps to push up in the wheelchair. Staff very friendly. Will continue to visit, it is our favourite UK holiday. "
7574,We drove to the Bonnie Badgers and parked on a nearby side street.  There is a bus stop just outside the hotel but there is no train station in Gullane. 
7575,Good size large car park. Two disabled parking spaces but the car park is mostly even or flat. There are bus stops nearby with regular service.
7576,"Lovely wide gentle ramp from parking to the entrance of café. The first door is automatic and very wide, the inner door is not but offers no real problem. Once inside the whole property id level, counter is low and service very pleasant. Once items are ordered they are automatically brought to the table, not just for disabled but for all customers!"
7577,"Chapelfield is my go-to location for a shopping trip. The facilities are lovely and accessible, and they also hold quiet hours for people with autism and other sensory processing issues. Every shop has step free access, and the dining terrace is completely open plan. There's lift access throughout, and plenty of accessible toilets as well as a Changing Places facility"
7578,Owners couldn't be more helpful and friendly
7579,"Lots of parking at Commercial Quay. Not sure if there are dedicated Blue Badge spaces. Buses to Commercial St, but then you'd have to walk round to the front entrance. Plenty of room for taxi drop-off, but then cobbles to negotiate"
7580,"Been several times with family and friends to various shows. Good access, seating alongside general seating so can sit with your party."
7581,Good street level access. Seating inside main entrance doors - these are not automatic doors and can be considered heavy.  There are volunteers at the door to assist.  Internal - floors ar flat with lifts connecting two floors.
7582,"Friendly, sensitive and helpful"
7583,There are always plenty of staff on the floor to assist with any help required 
7584,"Plenty of parking spaces nearby. Concierge parking also available.  Ramp access to the hotel is on the left hand side of the front door. I found the ramp a little difficult to navigate in my electric wheelchair, this was due to a tight and uneven turn near the start of the ramp.  Once inside the hotel, the corridors, cocktail bar and restaurant were all very spacious.  We ate in the Strathearn Restaurant. Normal toilets were just outside that restaurant, however the accessible toilets were 200yds away midway along the indoor shopping corridor."
7585,"Accessible loo was well signed. Fully equipped, but not large enough to enable the mobility scooter to be turned. Grab rails provided but the toilet itself was ‘normal’ height."
7586,"In the basement, which is accessible by lift, there are 2 accessible toilets, labelled handicapes. The accesible toilet was clean and spacious with a single grab rail and no emergency alarm."
7587,See above
7588,There is 3 accessible loos in the shopping centre and they are very easy to find they are also very clean and tidy inside and have handrails to hold onto to and there is enough space for at least 2 carers
7589,Easy access
7590,Not entirely sure as we came on foot.  There is parking behind quartermile in the streets nearby.
7591,"A busy London station with links to the underground, local taxis and buses. Best to check on the accessibility of your chosen method of transport. Buses are accessible as are most taxis."
7592,The one in the car park is well equipped and clean. It was not locked.
7593,It is wheelchair accessible to the wheelyboat on the slip and even can access the pontoons if necessary 
7594,Blue badge parking in the street outside
7595,"Most things within the hotel are accessibile in a wheelchair. The only except is the hair salon. In normal times the staff would make another arrangement but we visited shortly after lockdown was lifted. The signage to the Terrace Restaurant is tricky because it is signed the Brasserie. That's not such an issue if you can pop up and down stairs but felt a bit tedious till we worked it out. The hotel have made great efforts to have the outdoor spaces accessible but there's a bit more work to do on that. Very welcoming, though, and one of the most accessible places we have stayed."
7596,Very friendly staff but appalling access!
7597,"Signs clear, lift available, lots of space to get around easily"
7598,Accessibility is first class to all floors to see the exhibits. There are also steps if one is able to use them.  Signage is excellent and one is able to see all the exhibits. There are seats so you can take a rest.  
7599,"There are around 30 accessible parking spaces which are well signposted. However, we have been before when every space was full as it's popular and serves the plant nursery (amazing collection of Kane's to buy)."
7600,"Access is fairly straight forward to the reception area, though you may have to wait for a child to come along to press the 'door bell' to alert the staff as you cannot reach it when in a wheelchair!"
7601,the staff were very well informed about access and explained which paths might not be suitable for my chair.
7602,"The paths around the grounds are mainly concrete and in good condition. I took my mountain trike but would probably have managed just fine with my normal wheelchair. It is quite hilly - nothing very steep but lots of ups and downs. The whole place is signposted so it is really easy to find where you want to go.   The castle has a small ramp up to the front door - easy gradient. Then you get taken a slightly different route in, to bypass stairs. After that, all the downstairs is accessible. There is a lift to get you down one set of steps to access a lower level. The platform was extremely tight with my trike but plenty of room for a normal chair. The upper level isn't accessible but there is a video you can watch.  The bird of prey area and display are well worth a visit but if you have an assistance dog, be aware that the birds don't like dogs. We weren't told not to take Liggy in, but as soon as we got close, the bird began to react, so I took her straight out and let the rest of the family do that bit while Liggy and me had a rest and a drink. "
7603,Very tight for wheel chairs
7604,"Arrived at booking to find our table was upstairs with no lift access as it was broken and according to staff had been for some time. After being asked if we would be ok upstairs and saying we would have to be, we were then quickly reallocated a downstairs table. The entrance doors are heavy and a solo wheelchair user would find them difficult."
7605,Fine - all on the level and very close to the restaurant seating area.
7606,RADAR key required. The lock is a bit jerky (reported to staff on Dec 31st). Limited space - one wheelchair and an assistant would maybe struggle. Handrails on both sides and red cord on right hand side - although this does not reach the ground. Space under sink to roll under. The toilet opens onto the main floor so no corridors or tight spaces to move around. 
7607,"Not overall impressed, no one bothered to help us, and only did what was necessary. The whole experience was disappointing, and we spent very little in the shop."
7608,"Fun enthusiastic group, great hospitality."
7609,The staff we meet during our visit were very helpful 
7610,Small. Very low. Only 1 side had a grab rail so needed help
7611,The accessible entrance is to the side of the restaurant
7612,Very friendly and helpful staff! Knowledgeable about the area.
7613,"15 of us booked for the Flying Scotsman. We had 2 in electric wheelchairs & booked spaces for all in their accessible carriage. We were boarded first with a ramp for the chairs. One transferred to a chair one stayed in the wheelchair but it was great to be together for an unforgettable day.   The carriage has a disabled toilet with room to get the wheelchair in and transfer - though it is a little light on space we were impressed to have the provision with grab bars and stuff on an old train.  There were several staff members on hand to help detrain using the ramps. The shop and platforms were crowded for the special day but they, and the restaurant, were all flat access so would possibly be easier to access when quieter in the week or on a non-event weekend. We managed.  The route to/from the adjacent car park is currently a little narrow with works ongoing but still navigable by chair. There are some disabled spaces and you can get a free parking token from the shop if you have a blue badge.  Couldn’t have done better!!"
7614,Edward and Marion do everything to make your stay go well. Marion's cakes in the welcome pack are delicious. Edward is always at hand if you have a query. 
7615,No problems at all
7616,"Oaktree is a fairly large garden centre, well stocked with a good range of plants. It is wheel chair accessible, although with some shortcomings."
7617,Large enough for a powerchair
7618,"The Flat Spaces accommodation has been designed to be accessible by people with various types of mobility impairments. And you can tell by the way one relaxes into the interior that this is about as good as it gets for someone with a disability. And the awesome thing is that they plan to build them the same all over, so we can travel knowing that our special needs will be thought of. An exceptional shower and bathroom, perfect bedrooms and wonderfull living area."
7619,"Vey helpful, waitress service if necessary."
7620,lots of parking spaces
7621,No disabled parking however you could get a bus into town and walk.
7622,During lockdown walking to this establishment  was a ritual - they do  pastries to die for and coffee. This was fine but having the use of one hand takeaways can be a bit of a pain. So I was over the moon to discover they had knocked through to the shop next door to create a sitting area and an accessible loo!
7623,"The staff could have been more helpful. It was busy the day I went and would have been old if the staff had helped managed he lifts. I went to the roof garden which Is on the 5th floor I think and the lift kept stopping full up from the top floor so I couldn't fit in. I waited for ages to be able to get in. My Mom spoke to them when we got to the ground floor eventually and we left a comments card with an e mail address about the problem , but nobody got back to us."
7624,"Croft Bungalow was perfect for our week's stay.  The design, layout and adaptations made it fully accessible when using a four-wheeled walking frame or a manual wheelchair.  We were able to relax without worrying in the unfamiliar environment.  The extra touches and equipment, such as the riser/recliner chairs, were very much appreciated and helped immensely.  The garden is beautiful and it was a real treat to be able to enjoy all areas.  We look forward to coming back."
7625,"Even although I am I weegie [Glaswegian] I haven't been here since I was a child. I came to see the da Vinci drawings. There was 12 drawings from the Royal collection they had been 'acquired' by Charles II hundreds of years ago. I didn't realize the museum shut at 5 o'clock sharp, it was probably just as well because we had the restaurant booked for dinner. I will definitely be coming back, entering the main hall brought back a lot of childhood memories. It also houses one of my favorite paintings 'Christ of St. John of the Cross' by Salvador Dali."
7626,"We drove, and there are some disabled spaces, but it can get busy so it is best to get there early.  We were given a sign for our window enabling free parking when partaking in an activity."
7627,"As with much of Rome, cobbles prevail! But they are noticeably flatter and smoother than cobblestone surfaces I am used to at home. They're certainly very worn down around this daily market. Camp de'Fiori is colourful, lively, and a great place to pick up gifts or fresh produce."
7628,Large space with plenty of tables and chairs of different sizes. All on one floor. Pity about the 20cm front step.
7629,Very friendly staff
7630,"Ramp into shop, wide doors, sufficient space between most displays, accessible changing room in the far left - might be a bit narrow for a wheel chair to pass between sofa and register."
7631,Staff are very helpful and friendly
7632,There is a car park with designated spaces - 3 hours free with a Blue Badge.
7633,"The Origano is a very good restaurant, the food was served very quickly. It's also good to see the food being made. We didn't feel rushed in any way, esp. for a group of disabled people. The food was excellent, the pizzas were very good.  The prices were reasonable for what we got."
7634,"There is a large car park as there is a hotel on site, a bistro , a cafe and a bar and restaurant. There are very limited disabled spaces though . The whole car park is tarmac."
7635,"Parking spaces available in the church yard, but having to go round three sides of the church is a nuisance, particularly for someone with a walking stick. Bus stops nearby."
7636,"I went to see a musical during the Fringe at Pleasance Two, and had a great experience! Staff were friendly and helpful, and everything went smoothly. "
7637,"Car park with disabled spaces, popular at weekends.  Staff will advise if car park full.   Didn't use public transport. "
7638,"Thank goodness for satnav, not obvious to find.  The main parking area would be very difficult for wheelchair users or those with limited walking mobility, due to being a gravely surface.  We asked parking attendant if disabled parking, he pointed across the road.   We parked outside the ""restaurant"" which had one disabled space we could see, and room for quite a few cars.  Restaurant sounds grander than it is.  Along the path is another shack that was the monkey cafe, at first glance it looks to only have steps in, but has a ramp to the right of that door. Its choices were really basic, and moving space very limited, but it filled a hole! The little monkeys in the small enclosure outside are entertaining whilst having lunch out, (on a nice enough day).   We had a young lad keen to go see the animals, and headed for the entrance. A 4yr old, 1 adult wheelchair user, 2 adults (1 being my privately employed PA). I was really disappointed to find that they didn't offer complimentary 'assistants entry, or at very least significantly reduced. They stated there policy is only those with carers photo id, could be admitted, so with making my displeasure clear I paid the entrance fees.   I have employed PA's for 20+ years, and this is not something I have heard of before. I suggested she meant my CEA card, but no,  ""official like in a nursing home id for the carer to show-with a photo"". I totally understand they need to make money, but unfortunately I am really put off by this, as it doubles the cost for me to have a day out and join my friends. I can't go without an assistant.   The terrain was ok for me, a bit bumpy at times, but manageable with my electric wheelchair. I have poor balance so I chose my paths quite carefully. I was encouraged into puddles by my young friend, as I am assured splashing is fun!  The accessible loo I was in, was near the play park, it was also a baby change area.   The highlight for me was seeing the rescued  bears in the pond, and the monkeys, oh and the meerkats feeding. It was a good day out, not too big a place to go around, and had a play park for kids to have some fun..the £1 a go- karts were my little friends highlight. There was also an indoor play area, which we didn't use as it was a lovely day outside.   I would like to go back, but would need to weigh it up against travel/entrance cost of something else.   "
7639,"No negative issues, signage perhaps could be expanded."
7640,Venue was all one  level fantastic lighting and tables  smith non slippery floor 
7641,very friendly and helpful staff
7642,"The Blackpool Buses we used were wheelchair accessible and the drivers very friendly and helpful. We used the circular service (15 / 16) the goes around the town; very hand for the North Station, the Zoo, model village, South Beach and the centre of town."
7643,"All of the staff we dealt with were very pleasant, helpful and willing."
7644,"The food was very nice, Staff were friendly and helpful and there is access to bathrooms downstairs"
7645,On the day we visited there was adequate Disabled Parking Spaces.
7646,Fine apart from point re wetroom
7647,"Staff attendance at the toilets was poor. When reporting to the information desk as advised for assistance to board the train the service was poor. Simply told to make my way to the platform and someone would come and assist. Went to platform, nobody appeared and again fellow travellers helped by going and getting help. Help to board was grudgingly provided."
7648,Low Barns is a Nature Reserve . It is easily reached by road and there is some parking for disabled. It is well maintained by Volunteers  and its main feature is a 1.5 mile circular walk which take you through the reserve and by a river.  The staff are all very friendly and the teas and coffees are excellent!
7649,"This Tudor castle of the 16th century, is a MUST VISIT for disabled people. It stands just 12 miles from Bristol in the village of Thornbury, and is full of historical facts and artefacts and a truly interesting visit, where lunch or afternoon tea adds to its delight. The Tudor castle began construction in 1511 by Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of  Bedford Who lived 1478 until 1521, when sadly, he was beheaded by the order of  King Henry V111.  It is an early example of a Tudor house, now a grade 1 listed  building. The buildings are of Cotswold stone Ashlar, some stacks are of brick, and some roofs  are lead, others tiled. There are compass windows on its south side, most of the  windows though are metal casements, and it still has its original stone built  fireplaces. The beautiful ornate brick chimneys were built in 1514.  The Privy gardens as recorded in the 16th century have kept its name, and lay to the  south and south east of the castle. Noted early visitors to the castle were, Princess Mary who stayed for 18 days in 1525, before she became Queen, and later King Henry V111 and Anne Boleyn who had to spend 10 days here following the outbreak of plague in Bristol, and as you wander around room by room you will note some beautiful artefacts of historical interest. Following the death of Edward Stafford, The castle became crown property, but in 1554 the now Queen, Mary, gave back the castle to Henry Stafford, 1st Baron, but then over the years it fell into disrepair. In 1637 the new owner, a member of the Howard family moved in, and it remained in the Howard family until 1960’s. The castle was renovated in 1824, then in 1849, Henry Howard commissioned Anthony Salvin to restore the castle again, through 1850. In 1960, Sir Algar Howard sells the castle, and by 1966 it becomes  a restaurant and  hotel. Between 1966 and 1986, it was operated as one of the UK,s top restaurants, by Kenneth Bell, with staff including food writer Nigel Slater. According to a local newspaper, the Gazette, an article of April 2011 tells us that (quote) Thornbury castle have gone into administration. (end of quote). It had been owned by the Von Essen hotel group for the past 11 years. It was then bought by Thornbury castle hotel limited in Nov 2011, registered in London, who now manage the hotel, and on our visit in October 2021, is undergoing major renovations in many  parts of the grounds, but the 26 roomed hotel remains open for visitors, and well  worth going to see this quite remarkable castle hotel, which on the ground floor  areas is quite wheelchair friendly.  200 yards from the village of Thornbury, is the gateway into Thornbury castle, (photo 1)  set amounts tall ancient trees.  The 16th century castle buildings are of Cotswold stone Ashlar, some stacks of brick, and some of the roofs are lead, others tiled (photo 2). The castles beautiful ornate brick chimneys were built in 1514. During our visit in 2021 the castle is undergoing restoration work.  The car parking at the moment is on the grass lawn (photo 3) but is easy enough to push wheelchair along. This leads to a long hard path leading to the gateway (photo 4).  You enter the castle through the gateway, on the western side into the inner courtyard. Over to your right in the courtyard is the entrance door to the reception (photo 5), the door being of solid oak. This 26 bedroom hotel remains open for visitors. The reception area is of dark oak panelling and a intricately designed carved desk, (photo 6) giving a feeling of history just oozing out at you. We then entered the Great Hall, and immediately found a place to put the wheelchair (photo 7). We sat in the oak panelled Great Hall for coffee. A very comfortable, elegant room, beautifully furnished, (photo 8) all made by Stephen Edgar, whose workshop is in the castle, and designed with 17th and 18th century decor. While sitting there your eyes are drawn upward (photo 9) to two magnificent  chandeliers (photo 10). Placing my very dry Riesling on the wine table, so as to admire the huge ornate Urn (photo 11) depicting the visit of King Henry V111 and Anne Boleyn in 1535 where they stayed for ten days. There were more urns, so intricately made, absolutely beautiful, it’s hard to describe, and then lunch was served to us in the Great hall (photo 13). (photo 14) Stepping out of the hall, you come to the flagstoned hallway which led to the disabled toilet (photo 15), quite small, spotlessly clean, beautifully tiled, (photo 16) but too small to take wheelchair into. From the Great hall a solid oak door leads you through (photo 17) into another small room where afternoon tea may be served (photo 18). A beautifull huge metal casements window overlooking the gardens (photo 19) invites you to an intimate table for two. The stone built fireplace in the Great hall (photo 20) is actually the original, dating back to 1514. On a cold winters day that would be a delight to sit by, but it now gave us a chance to sit and contemplate our further exploration of the magnificent case, as you will see in (PART TWO, EXPLORING THE CASTLE)  Our final thoughts Our first impression on seeing the castle was disappointing, it just looked cold, bare and uninviting.  Then we stepped inside, and wow, it was so unexpectedly beautiful, and our (PART ONE, THE GREAT HALL) concentrates in a must come to visit and see for yourself, and the ground floor is completely wheelchair friendly."
7650,Yes there is an accessible toilet on site 
7651,"There are disabled toilets on each floor however, sometimes not as tidy or clean as preferred but are shown that they are cleaned regularly through charts shown on the walls and doors of the toilets. "
7652,"I am an amputee(BKA Lt leg)Stayed here 22nd/26th May`17.Spotlessly clean room with basic but large wet room. Staff are genuinely glad to see you.The welcome is so nice from all the staff.Hotel is clean and tidy inside. Outside needs a coat of paint. Hotel is joined to Victoria Pub by covered walkway all level access.All meals can be taken here. As a jumping off point for Eden,Heligan it is ideal. Free parking,disabled bays by main doors,level access."
7653,"Although only one disabled bay, it’s right by the hotels entrance, and other bays are very handy anyway. The entrance into hotel is on the level, with a push wooden door that’s easy to use. Being so excited to view this beautiful hotel, we forgot to check if lifts are available, but all we needed to see was on ground floor level anyway."
7654,I did not have much interaction with staff but in the restaurant they were very helpful and polite.
7655,"There is an accessible toilet, but none of our group used it on this occasion.  All of the group had used it previously and said it was a good toilet.  "
7656,"A delightful day awaits all that travels on ‘The Watercress Line’ we visited when Thomas the Tank Engine was visiting as well. Nothing was too much for the helpers at the railway stations we visited they put me and my family in a guards van while we traveled on the railway if I were able to walk from the guards van I could of left my mobility scooter there and had a table seat in the main carriages but I cannot do so,So we waited in the guards van which had plenty of seats for my family. "
7657,"Well signposted, large room with lots of room to manouevre.  Plenty of grab rails"
7658,London buses are great - entirely accessible with staff who seem entirely okay about putting the effort in to get you on. 
7659,"Very helpful and friendly staff, geared up to meeting the needs od people with disabilities. Ray, whose brainchild the cafe is, is often on hand and well worth grabbing for a chat!"
7660,"Used my Welcome app and was greeted at door then escorted by Ricardo to my friend. The staff including Marketing Manager Sylvia were amazing. Very friendly, very attentive. Made me feel like a regular, so much so, I want to go back."
7661,"There was a council car park at the entrance to Norie Miller Park however, it was cornered off for the event. Therefore, we parked about a 5-minute walk away in a council car park. Around Perth there are a few council car parks near Norie Miller Park.  Within at least a 10-minute distance from the park there is a bus station and train station. I'm not sure about the local public transport because I am not from this area."
7662,We drove to Balgrove Larder. There are sign for Balgrove Larder on the roads. The car park is a large gravelled area so it was easy to park but the gravel did make it hard to push a wheelchair. See photos)
7663,"You enter via a very well stocked deli which has a great range of meats, cheeses, wine and lots of Italian treats. The restaurant is quite tight with seating but I was still able to manage moving around in my electric wheelchair. This staff were very helpful in getting me a suitable table. I had a special of a ragu of slow cooked ox cheek served wit freshly made pasta. Absolutely delicious I will need to get back here to try some more dishes."
7664,Staff were excellent but the staff member who helped me in the car park was as high as the sky.
7665,Changing place!!
7666,"It is a nice drive to get to the hotel, intriguing approach, and you can park up in disabled bays right by the hotels entrance, and it’s ramp that is needed to get you into hotel. (SEE PHOTOS 6 to 9)"
7667,lift as above
7668,"roomy and with good disabled friendly locks which don't challenge my weak hands when on my own! Easy positioning to get in and out, except in roof top restaurant where turning in an out of is is a little tight."
7669,"Main walk was a good quality path which was accessible along its entirety, a hide which had just a tiny lip to get over and a space inside to sit in your chair. Lots of children's activities enroute, some of which you can access. The visitors center has ramped access but the shop is very tight. Staff happy to move things but shame to have to ask."
7670,"Very friendly, helpful staff who go out of their way to help with any issues."
7671,"Overall I could get level access to the platform or via a door lip through the ticket office. Buckfastleigh has a model indoor railway, shop and cafe building which we did not go into. Accessible carriage has a manual ramp to get into which is pretty steep. At Totnes the station has the platform and toilets only. Access to the rare breeds farm and cafe is down a slope and cross over the line."
7672,Stayed and what lovely staff booked an accessable room online was delighted with the wet room facilities. On arrival and departure staff were very helpful offers a hand with bags 
7673,"From what I could see the access was good. The building was well signposted, and there was a ramp to the right of the door, in addition to the stairs. "
7674,"Though it might be slightly difficult to get there, there is easier access within the building including the cafe and auditoriums. Friendly and approachable staff.  Overall, a good experience for a night out at the Royal Concert Hall!"
7675,Access to the boardwalk was unrestricted. If using a stick make sure you place it on the planks and not in the gaps. A gentle slope to the sand and 2 benches. 
7676,There is an accessible loo but it was tucked away in a corner by the main entrance. It might not be too easy to find for some folk. It is a good size and easy to get in.
7677,I could get to viewing area and ramp to accessible loo. But cloakroom is at top of ramp so people standing there all the time. Couldn’t get to the bars as no lowered counters! And couldn’t fight people from my chair!! I liked that toilet was NKS/Radar as meant it wasn’t used by people who didn’t need it!
7678,No accessible toilets available except at Fishers Landing station in Vancouver. That one is very clean.
7679,"Had to go up a ramp, around a corner and avoiding a pillar - a 5 point turn. Tiny room with baby change where space for a transfer should be. So small that once my small scooter was in, the basket was over the toilet! Red cord was tied up. I left a red cord card on it. "
7680,"Friendly, competent and helpful - even though they were rushed off their feet. Service too was speedy."
7681,Level access for wheelchairs. Door is heavy and non-powered. There is an accessible loo. The counter is not lowered. They have no tables that are suitable for me as a power chair user. There is air conditioning and wifi. 
7682,"Once up the steep cobbled entrance road, the path is loose gravel.  There are steps up to the ticket off so it's inaccessible from the front door. However a member of staff hurried out as soon as he saw me. There's a  special wheelchair entrance that bypasses the ticket off (see photo) and this leads to the rear of the ruin. Much if these outside areas are cobbled.  There's  a ramp leading to the inside rooms from these areas to the rear, and this route takes you via a sharp and quite tight turn into the Georgian interior. Once inside it's nice and flat with plenty if Soave it manoeuvre. There are good displays on the walls.  Shop had plenty if space too."
7683,They gave me a room on the first floor near the lift and did help to get our luggage to the room and explain which parts of the hotel were accessible. 
7684,"We entered the main door which was a little tricky but we did get some help from staff the second time we used it. I'm sure there may be easier entrances in other parts of the store. Once inside the surfaces are smooth and easy to negotiate as a wheelchair user.  We took the nearby lift, which was beautifully decorated, down to the technology department. The lift was spacious and the signage inside explaining the different floors was really good. Getting around the departments was good as unlike many stores there was plenty of room between the displays."
7685,"This venue has an Auditorium, a workshop and studio to hire. The performance of the Pace Annual Panto is held here and various productions and concerts throughout the year.  The café is only open when there is a performance.     The Art Centre is closing in 2020 for refurbishment."
7686,"The front entrance had wide automatic doors, there was signage inside showing where to go. You book and check in online but the staff are there to help. We were shown through a single door to the lifts, both large and working well. The staff helped with the door to the lift (which you need to swipe your key card to go through). It was easy to find out room with the signage. As this is a hub, the room was small but actually better than I expected. The accessible rooms are bigger and have high hypos beds. There are modern touch screen controls at head height (sitting) at the beds where you can control lights and temperature which was so helpful! There was a big TV on the wall that was loaded with movies! There was a fold out wall mounted desk with was so handy for me to prepare medications, there was also another seat in the corner. There was a small table in-between the beds. "
7687,It was easy to get around with the shops on one level. Big Sainsburys that was good. Fair spread of other shops. All open fronted and easy to wheel around.
7688,"Non asisted wheelchair access, without barriers. The building is easy to find because the facade is red an has a signal."
7689,Only used sink
7690,Very helpful
7691,Plenty of parking. 
7692,"Other than the loos in our room, I did not use the others in the hotel. Whilst the one in the room had a drop down rail, I found that it was very close to the wall and sink, which made access difficult.  I could not reach the loo roll holder and just used the spare roll because of this."
7693,"West Bank park is a 20-acre park located in Holgate, just outside the city centre. There is a large woodland area where there are  paths to follow through the trees. Next to this is a meadow area with picnic benches. The park has 2 very well maintained bowling greens which are often in use by West Bank Park Bowling Association, there are benches along the periphery to sit and watch. For children and teenagers there are two playgrounds - one for under eleven years, the other for over eleven's. The park also has a basketball court which is accessible when the park is open. There is a pergola walk, with roses and flowers to either side, but this does contain steps. The alternative path is wide and even, it is set on a slope and there are a few benches along the way to stop and rest if needed.. There are toilets in the park and a small car park nearby. The park is set along a main road between York city centre and Acomb, and this has numerous bus services running along it.  "
7694,Right in between several bus stops but no idea about disabled parking. Only one wheelchair accessible entrance (the side). 
7695,"All staff were very welcoming and helpful. Nathan the Motability advisor was very professional and experienced at helping me make the right choice for my needs, putting me at ease right away.I find transferring in and out of new cars very stressful , as it can be a struggle, so I was particularly impressed that he also offered me the option of trying out the car in a more private area if I preferred , rather than the front  of the main entrance. This made a huge difference to me choosing a new car. "
7696," The accessible toilet can be reached through  a door  which opens  in  The way, and then  slightly  turning your wheelchair to the left to access the sliding door  Into the toilet.  The toilet has grab rails."
7697,Excellent tarmac footpaths all round. Well maintained.
7698,There is a bathroom with facilities for disables as you can see on their website. There is also a shower chair. There is space for a carer.
7699,One of the largest dedicated Blue Badge car parks I've seen in a long time. Plenty of space to transfer from the car to the wheelchair.  The parking bays are are about 100m from the main entrance. The signposting from the main road was not as clear as it couldh've been. We drove to the wrong entrance before finding out way to the accessible parking. Not too sure about public transport but there were buses running along the nearby main road.
7700,"The car park lacks disabled bays, but the venue is directly next to the train station, with several bus stops nearby too."
7701,"Lots of dropped kerbs and flat area, but cobbles in some places. "
7702,Usual city parking. 
7703,I would normally travel up to Glasgow by train however as there was disruption on the railway I drove up by car with the help of my Mum. We parked in the St Enoch Centre car park which was ideal as it is open air and so no height restriction. Only thing is you have to have the right change availabile for the car park meter. Alternatively you can call Ring Go from your mobile and pay over the phone. Telephone number on parking meter. There are also also accessible and changing places toilets available within the St Enoch centre.
7704,"The one member of staff I spoke to was friendly, but he came up with a great number of fatuous excuses for the lack of a ramp, none of them remotely convincing or realistic. For this, for the failed doorbell, and for the shop's complete failure to provide access to wheelchair users, only one star."
7705,"The museum is in a former Synagogue. It has an interesting exhibition of Jewish culture. There are a few stairs, but with my crutch I found it do-able."
7706,"We went by car. Parking was near the entrance on grass.  You can drop of in front on a hard, flat surface."
7707,"First time both at the Emirates Arena and to a basketball game, so it was great to combine them both for a great experience. I had absolutely no problems at all with accessibility throughout the arena and it was fun from beginning to end.  I would definitely return again."
7708,"As it's in a forest, expect uneven surfaces eg tree roots!"
7709,"The toilets are clean and well maintained, large enough for your needs, although you may have to leave wheelchair by door. It has grab rails and pull cord."
7710,"I always find this station easy to use, and I never find myself panicking unable to locate a platform or where I need to be. The addition of Platform 9 3/4 is a great touch!"
7711,They were all very helpful and proactive in making the visit enjoyable.
7712,The parking is near the ramp to get into the chalet
7713,"I love this place!  The food is fantastic,  and the staff are really friendly and helpful.  And it's reasonably priced.  I haven't been to a gig there in a while,  but I often go during the day for coffee or lunch.  Ed, the manager,  is very approachable if you have any comments or issues,  and the atmosphere  - being a converted church  - is quirky and fun. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that it has a glass door which,  if no-one sees you coming and opens it for you, you have to push open (with your feet  if you're me) and I'm always afraid of breaking as it bangs quite hard, and the counter is quite high and makes me feel a bit like a 5 year old in a sweet shop!"
7714,Generally speaking all types of transport are available gates located all round the stadium so very easy to access!
7715,"We were able to park right outside on our first visit and in the small car park on our next visit. There is on street parking and a council carpark across the road. There is a bus stop just outside and the church is in quite a central location, about ten minutes walk from town"
7716,"The reason for my low rating is that although the bar and restaurant are very accessible, the complete lack of a wheelchair friendly toilet makes it a no go. Who wants to have a couple of beers and not have the ability to go to the bathroom?? Made even more infuriating by there being 2 men's toilets. Why hasn't one of these been made into a disabled toilets?"
7717,Parking  was in the 8 space car park which has only 1 disabled space
7718,"Friendly, helpful and efficient."
7719,There is a toilet labelled with the wheelchair access sign in the car park / field. I did not look inside. Toilets are available at the cafe and all visitors need to ask for a key - I  did not see any signs to them being accessible. 
7720,Access is simple via a step free doorway
7721,Bus stop 500 yards Disabled parking for rear and side exit
7722,"It has level access, lovely staff and supports young people with learning difficulties."
7723,"Excellent facilities, lots of space."
7724,"their is lifts at the new entrance at George square towards the toilets or the main station, also lifts to take you down to low level, their is announcements all the time with what platform the train is coming from"
7725,"Very good, they will help to make your trip here enjoyable."
7726,"Can't comment on the parking. The restaurant is in Correction Wynd, which is just off Union Street. Union Street is very well served by wheelchair accessible buses. The cafe is best approached by heading down St Nicholas Street (pedestrianised) and turning left into Correction Wynd."
7727,The staff were all friendly and helpful. My only negative is one male member of staff who we encountered several times. He was very friendly but made lots of assumptions. Suggested that 'one of the men [in our party] should push me up the ramps' and several times warned me to pace myself because it's a big place and I would get tired. He needs to realise that wheelchair users are not necessarily weak and helpless!  Everyone was great with my assistance dog. She got lots of fuss (which she loves) but they all asked first and were respectful.
7728,Brilliant! There were tarmac paths throughout the grounds and they were well maintained and easy to follow - even in the dark! We stopped in at the Terrace Cafe on the way round too which again was easy to access and had plenty of space.
7729,An automated door gets you into the building and once inside it's very accessible.
7730,Fully wheelchair accessible bar.  Garden overlooks Priory ruins and is very pleasant.  Accessible loo inside. Not a huge menu but plenty of choice including veggie options. Food restricted to set times eg lunch 12 - 2. Food was good.
7731,"Chania has its own airport. I had a very positive experience with special assistance arriving but on the way back they only took me as far as the gate in a wheelchair. When I asked where my support was they said that I had told them I could so stairs and they had taken me via wheelchair to the gate and only offered me the regular shuttle bus. I then had to walk down the stairs and join the speedy boarders on the shuttle and disembark. It was only after one of the other passengers complained that someone came to help me up the airplane steps.  From the airport there are buses. However I took a taxi which took about 20 minutes and cost 25 euros, each way (March 2018). The taxi took me directly to my hotel and from there I was able to walk round the harbour and town centre."
7732,With a Changing Places Toilet on site and numerous other accessible loos and changing rooms it was fabulous. The accessible changing rooms were poolside and had ample room for changing. Staff were on hand should you need anything.
7733,"This is a huge landmark hotel on the M4 corridor in South Wales, so you might expect it to respect disability / accessibility laws, but amazing there isn’t a single fully accessible room in the place. I’m only a part time wheelchair user, so I managed, but I’m always on the lookout , so I double checked, and disappointingly it’s true, no accessible bathroom in the place. One room with some rails ( mine didn’t) and an over the bath seat, ONE, but that’s it. What about the fab new Lodges they’ve just finished? Nope.  The Spa itself is accessible although the changing rooms are a bit of a challenge to negotiate. They let me take my chair into the pool environment which was nice and there are rails and staff to help you in and out of the water.  Couldn’t find the disable parking spaces, had to pay extra for a room that I could move around in my wheelchair ( they did say the standard rooms would be tight for that) and no rails in the bathroom, let alone a walk in shower ( we did have a discussion about that, reception describes all the showers as walk in, but they are not level access.) The staff were in the main absolutely lovely, I felt like a normal human being and that is a great compliment to them, just a shame the organisation as a whole makes it very clear that wheelchair users are not a clientele they want staying in their hotel. "
7734,"There were only two members of staff when I visited as far as I could see, both were very friendly. However, once we sat at our table we waited about 15 minutes until we got any service and when our orders were taken they took both drinks and food at the same time. I feel like they might have forgotten about us.  My helpers burger wasn’t cooked enough but, the staff were very apologetic and took it off our order."
7735,Blue badge parking available.
7736,See general description - only ground floor accessible
7737,We went to the disabled toilet beside the great hall and it was excellent.  There are other disabled toilets but we didn't go into them
7738,On street parking is available and Blue Badge holders can park outside the front door. A bus stop nearby has frequent accessible buses into town.
7739,"Entrance has automatic powered doors, access to restaurant via lift"
7740,"There are two entrances into the tower, the one is step free and is at the rear of the tower, I had been directed to this when I emailed.  There is one lift to get up to the shop and floor to see the 4d experience, which made quite a queue because all people were using it. But was plenty of space inside the lift. There is a smaller lift then up to the 4d experience which was all accessible. Then the lifts right up the tower were large and accessible. There was plenty of space to go onto the glass floor, you cannot go outside unless you go up the steps, but the views are brilliant from the glass floor and I didn't feel I missed out on going outside. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. They showed and directed you to where you needed to be."
7741,"I've never met anyone who would not help, even when busy they have radioed for someone else."
7742,Staff were fantastic and friendly.
7743,Peaceful surroundings. Lovely cottage Review of Crathie Opportunity Holidays Reviewed 3 days ago We have just returned from Crathie. Can not praise enough.  Everything was amazing. Cottage had everything that was needed and more. The setting was wonderful. Towels and crockery etc were of high quality It was so sad to leave . Crathie Kirk was at end of road and balmoral car park too Ballater only minutes up the road with supermarket and shops thoroughly recommend. Date of stay: June 2021
7744,This is a newly refurbished station and it's amazing.
7745,Staff in the train station were reasonably friendly - but not particularly helpful. Our train was more than 45 minutes late and staff didn't mention this to us when we made enquiries at the desk. Conductors within the train were much more friendly and informative.
7746,"We were able to organise a family reunion that met everybody's needs.....aged from 8 months to 70 years! Fantastic!!!! The wheelchair accessible cottage was thoughtfully organised. The bathroom and kitchen in particular were spacious and fitted with every device to support the disabled member of our party. In addition, were masses of games, information about the area, dvds and lots of comfortable places to sit. Although set in a secluded area there are various restaurants and places to visit that are wheelchair accessible. Edward and Marian are great hosts and always on hand to provide support and advice. All in all a great place for a happy break!"
7747,"There is plenty of disabled parking along the south shore, surrounding the dam wall and within Kielder village. However, there is no parking and visitors are unable to drive along the south shore at all."
7748,We took an accessible cab to and from the airport and MRT in between. Cab cost is S$50 per trip regardless of distance. MRT is fabulous and population extremely helpful.
7749,"The first individual I asked for help finding the disabled toilet did not speak English! The second person said something along the lines of ""No sir we do not have a disabled toilet""   He then proceeded to direct me to the one over the other side of the shopping centre. I was totally gobsmacked!"
7750,There is a ramp at the side of the building which you would use if you were approaching from the main road along the coast (A901). It is wide with a gentle gradient as is the ramp from the car park at the back. There is a nice wide boardwalk in front of the restaurant although there is one small step through the entrance doors of the restaurant which is why they lose 1 mark.
7751,Loo fine but doors too heavy. It was busy enough for there to be people around to help. 
7752,Very accessible building. Now has an external lift to upper floor. Lovely outside seating area.
7753,"Level access throughout, including restaurant. Lifts to all floors. Level access entrance to building to the left of the stairs up to the main entrance."
7754,Cars can park right next to the accomdation. There is a ramp up to the front door of the cabin or a couple of shallow steps
7755,There is disabled parking outside of the Sealife Center it is council owned and all disabled people must pay for parking there regardless of any vehicle paying road tax or not.
7756,Very helpful and friendly.
7757,"This is one of the top hotels we invite you to go and visit, our highly recommended 5* plus hotel, and we have three parts we have reviewed for you to read, as this is such a wonderful experience, one we will never forget. Part one then will advise you about our absolutely wonderful lunch here in the Hillfields bar lounge. Part two takes you on a trip through the hotels gardens. Part three was for my husband, the highlight, of being shown around the most appealing, wonderful Spa that the hotel is famous for, luxury at its best. Do please read these three parts and see what life is really like for those who can enjoy life to the full.   Driving through rolling Sussex countryside led us to the 123 acres of a most elegant 19th century house, dating back to 1849, offering luxury at its very best. The country house was built by James Hodges, who lived here, while also spending 7 years in Canada while he directed the building of Victoria bridge, near Montreal, before coming home again to his delightful house. He died in 1878, and the house was sold to Louise Schott, who came from a family of merchants, but he himself becoming a banker. On his death, his working partner Louise Floersheim lived here, and in 1903, he extended the house, using Bath Stone, and adding an Orangery. He passed away in 1917, but his wife Julia (nee Baddeley) continued to live here until 1922. Then an engineer Sir Lindsey Byron Peters lived here, he married and had three children, but the family moved out in 1933. In 1935 the new owner Colin Goldsworthy Haywood developed the formal gardens and a delightful terrace. He never married and remained single for the rest of his life, living here for almost 40 years until his death in 1971.  During 1972, the country house opened its doors as a hotel, then in 1981, new owners bought the house, and it was to become known as “Exclusive Hotels and Venues” founded by Giuseppe Pecorelli, until his son Danny Pecorelli took over, and this was the first of his Exclusive Hotel chain, and what a fine job he has done with Pennyhill Park, and his other 5* hotels around the country. Interestingly, during 1999 they built a training pitch here for the England rugby team, who went on to win the Rugby World Cup in 2003. Today it still plays a part in the National teams training facilities at St George’s park. Pennyhill Park itself is only a 10 minute drive from Ascot, and just 20 minutes away from Windsor castle.   This is to some extent a dog friendly hotel, where your canine friends may join you in one of the bedrooms, but do inquire before booking a room, as then your pets may be allowed into the reception and lobby areas. Accessible rooms are available, but must be pre-booked, and from what we have seen of the hotel, we know the rooms will be a delight and disabled friendly. We will never be able to afford an overnight stay here, as a top class hotel deserves its high charges, so our review cannot include disabled rooms, but our experience of reviewing over the decades will give us enough confidence to recommend a stay here as we know you will be well taken care of.  OUR REVIEW  Having just come off the A30 and entering Pennyhill Park through its lovely gateway, it’s just a short but beautiful drive passing many very old trees as you arrive at the arched gateway which looks so appealing (photo 1) then a few more feet and through another arched gateway (photo 2) will get you to the main entrance, where we found the one and only disabled bay (3) right by the entrance. Being pushed over a level tarmac and paved path took us toward a beautiful heavy wooden double push door that awaited us (4) and into the entrance (5) leading to the Hillfield restaurant, and your immediate thoughts are opulence. The doorway ahead led us into the Hillfield bar lounge (6) a delightful area.  We sat in the bar lounge, very comfortable and a most pleasing deco (7) you feel at once you will be pampered here. The counter ahead was being prepared for light snacks, and this is where you order your drinks, beverages and light snacks (8) but of course a waitress will be over long  before you have to trouble yourself. We enjoyed a beautiful light mid day snack (photo 9) with a delicate glass of fresh Merlot, all elegantly laid out in very pleasing surroundings. By our side a doorway awaits where you will be escorted to your table in the Hillfields restaurant, (10) and into the exquisite dining room for your afternoon lunch (photo 11). Here in the opulent restaurant the perfectly prepared buffet style dishes (12) will tempt to tickle your taste buds (13) Along by the reception in a lovely corridor (photo 14) are the toilet facilities, beautifully tiled wall and flooring in a reasonably spacious toilet, toilet with a grab handle available for you, (15) and if you need to, you can get your wheelchair inside and spin around.  As we investigated the hotel, we found one of the delightful lounge areas, to sit with a cocktail perhaps (photo 16) or close by a lovely small cosy sitting area by a welcoming fire, (17)  heat radiating from its fireplace.  Then another beautiful passageway (18) which lead us out to the views over the gardens (19).  OUR FINAL THOUGHTS about part one of our review of Pennyhill Park. If you feel in need of a bit of luxury, this hotel is a must. Throughout it is wheelchair friendly, the deco is delightful, and our one thought was, Opulent. We most highly recommend you visiting for its sheer pleasure, and afternoon lunch will be delightful. "
7758,"The nearest tube station is not accessible for a wheelchair so I travelled by taxi on my first visit and returned by bus. On my second visit I travelled by bus which is very convenient, free and more comfortable. There are direct and frequent buses from both Victoria and Waterloo mainline stations. From Victoria - 35 minutes and Waterloo - 15/20 minutes. There are very few dropped kerbs outside venue so tricky for a power chair user to cross the road for the return bus journey."
7759,"Arriving at the Distillery's visitor centre you have two large glass doors. These can be a wee bit heavy but staff were watchful and quick to lend a hand. Once inside a warm welcome awaits and you can decide whether or not to take one of the tours. Holyrood is unusual in that they are producing both Whisky and Gin on site; hence the choice of tours.   While you wait there's a great shop area to browse and everything was on display in easy to see units - no wondering what was lurking on the upper shelves or behind other things. The two till areas made for easy access too - no fiddly counters to rest your chin on here!  I went on the tour having decided to 'see everything' and was instantly charmed by the amazingly large lift. It's not often I can wheel my powerchair in a lift and then do a complete three hundred and sixty turn. I think my guide thought I had lost the plot when I did three quick rotations!  The lift quickly takes you up to one of the upper levels and the start of the tour.  It was a sharp intake of breath when we entered the first room - all to do with scents and smells - but with an appearance of something of a cross between Hogwart's, a chemistry lab, and Merlin's den! Accessible benches laid out with intriguing glass containers, small bottles, colourful wall charts, and a big black wall of iconic rune like interpretation. You'll have guessed by now that I loved this room.   Moving onward, we moved to the next section, each being cleverly masked from view until you sweep into them. A view down on to the two beautiful shiny copper stills - I'm sure they have a name but that bit escaped me as I pondered on the idea of how few distilleries create this 'gallery' style of view which is so helpful for wheelchair users who otherwise spend a lot of time peering up at stuff.  The enchantment continues as I saw another colourful room explain the amazing flavours that are infused in to the gin making process. I will leave the surprise element of that room for your visit, suffice to say it was vibrant, easy to wheel around and complete with great interpretation walls and panels. I fully intend to bring my visually impaired pal along on a visit - he'll love this magical room. Oh yes, I nearly forgot... in this room sits an amazing work of art - although many will call it the gin still or something similar. It was great to be able to get so close to it.  We meandered on to different levels and were able to revisit my two friendly whisky stills but this time on the same level as the stills. Again very easy to wheel up to and get a sense of the scale. After a pause to admire the stills and the irresistible peering down through the grated floor we moved on.  Going through what looked like a wooden door we were plunged into a dimply lit, aromatic, chamber ... no, not a Harry Potter one but a warehouse style room where casks sat on shelves and upturned barrels formed high level tabes and the atmosphere recreated that of the typical whisky warehouses we see dotted throughout Scotland. The atmosphere, the aroma, the temperature here was so right, I imagined myself being in one fo the many warehouse I have visited on my travels.   From here, where you get a wee dram, we moved into the bar area where you can sit a while, enjoy the view of the Craigs and then the final descent back down to the shop area and time to say good bye. "
7760,"Smallish venue, unable to get close enough to the tables although my electric scooter is very large.  Everything I needed was on one level."
7761,"The nearest tube stations are Russell Square, Euston or Holborn, none of which are step free. The nearest step free tube station is King's Cross and from there you can get at 91 bus which, along with several other buses stop nearby. "
7762,There is a train station but it stops by the South Terminal and those who want to travel to the North Terminal take a short ride on the shuttle which connects the two terminals. 
7763,The cafe staff at ghe 1st venue were friendly but service was very slow.  The staff at the pub were very friendly and helpful. 
7764,"I went to see Tom Ballard in Pleasance Upstairs at the Fringe. It's a very small venue, but surprisingly comfy and even more surprisingly accessible thanks to lift access."
7765,The toilet is easily accessible from the front entrance however if someone came through the back entrance they would have to walk to the other end of the station to access the toilet. The toilets are very clean with grab rails in place for stability; there is enough room for a wheelchair to be moved around as well as have a carer to assist if needed.
7766,"Very friendly and able. Mostly youngsters. Very helpful with assistance. They are always most welcoming...wether you are calling in just for coffee or wanting a bar meal. Be aware you cannot book a table in the bar area...I usually go at about 11, have coffee and then stay for lunch! It all gets mega busy in summer...same as in most seaside towns."
7767,Very friendly and helpful
7768,"Signage was adequate, though I went to see a specific event for disabled access day, for which there wasn't signage from elsewhere in the market. The crowds are heavy, so it's impossible to see where you're going or get about easily. Particularly, because there is so much to see and a lot of the crowd are trying to eat and walk, as a wheelchair user on my own I found it difficult to get around and see things. It would be better on a less busy day, but on Saturdays there are the most extra events and demos going on.  Some individual shops were too small to go into with a wheelchair, but staff would speak to you on the threshold and bring you things. Most stalls have low displays and are easy to access from a wheelchair.  Getting between stalls is difficult - there are not enough dropped kerbs, the pavements are too narrow and streets are poorly maintained. There's quite a lot of broken glass/discarded food on the ground because trolleys of food have to bump up and down the kerbs."
7769,"The shopping centre has very good disabled access, there are several lifts available throughout the centre to allow access to both levels.  The lower food court has several levels of seating; all levels are accessible via stairs or ramps."
7770,Friendly and helpful
7771,Level access. Doors electric and automatic.   Lift available up to second level. Didn't use it but door looks manual.   Aisles are wide. No designated wheelchair accessible till.
7772,"Very accessible venue, ramps were clearly indicated. I had the option of early entry. Staff were very helpful on the phone and in person.  My only criticism would be the wheelchair spaces were only in the very  front row but the carers seat was right next to me which was a plus point. I would highly recommend this venue for wheelchair users."
7773,Allowed late check-out at no extra cost and re-arranged beds to meet our needs.
7774,"Friendly, knowledgeable and chatty. "
7775,The staff are very friendly.
7776,"There is a ramp available to get over the gully, you can knock on door and they'll bring it out.   Reception desk is high up but payment machine isn't fixed. "
7777,The people in the Cathedral were keen to assist but no masks were worn and people got too close which I find is often a problem with people and wheelchair users. I kept moving away but they kept moving closer! I can still hear you from a 4ft distance you know!
7778,"The signs were in large print, power assisted doors, Ramps instead of stairs ,Chair hoist , Disabled changing areas , toilets and showers."
7779,"Very friendly, helpful and approachable."
7780,"Flat thresholds into each cabin, wider than standard doorways for wheelchair access, wet rooms, kitchen units move to allow a wheelchair user to get close to the work tops, recline/riser seat, higher toilets with toilet frames, grab rails, electric beds etc."
7781,All staff that I encountered during our visit were very friendly and helpful with anything that we needed.
7782,"There are multiple disabled toilets in the facility, which are clearly marked to inform others easily. "
7783,Former summer residence of the King of Greece and birthplace of Prince Philip in 1921.  The palace also houses a museum. There are extensive grounds.
7784,Self catering chalets with total accessibility. Everything is well thought out for mobility without sacrificing the overall design. Fantastic view over the Firth of Forth. This was our third visit and we have already booked for next year.
7785,There are two publicly accessible toilets in the complex. One was fine and the other out of order.
7786,"Fantastic, always keen to help and there are plenty around. "
7787,"Beach wheelchairs always need someone with you who has a bit of muscle, but there wasn't far to go from our parking place to get out on the beach. When I later took my small scooter up to Sammy's cafe and shop, I thought at first I wouldn't be able to get to the cafe because there was at least one big step up, but it turned out there was a way in through the shop. I certainly couldn't get up the step to the open-sided marquee where everyone was eating due to Covid rules, but the staff took pity on me and my family and set up a table for us just inside in a well-ventilated place near an open door."
7788,"We were shown right in and the route was level access all the way, except for the aforementioned door."
7789,They were all very knowledgeable and helpfull.
7790,Plenty of blue badge spaces available near entrance to site
7791,"We were well treated by Henry’s staff, from head waiter to the chef himself, a nice little team set up."
7792,"Got taxi in and out from Airport, so access to hotel was no problem"
7793,"Once inside, getting around was easy and there were plenty of staff to help point the way. You can wheel in to the booking office, or perhaps pop in to the cafe for refreshments. Or as we did; head off to the event space if you’re attending an event. The spaces were interesting and the main hall an unexpected experience as you’d never imagine such a large and ecorative space sat at the top of the building. We particularly liked being able to get up to the gallery level and look down on proceedings. That felt good as usually wheelchair users end up looking up at things so to look down and see everything was great."
7794,A lot of the ground is very gravelly and extremely difficult to walk on if you have mobility problems
7795,"Dawlish Railway Station has step free access to platform 2, with trains heading towards Exeter/ London. Platform 1 with trains towards Paignton/ Torquay is accessible via a railway bridge with stairs only. However through Special Assistance they can arrange and accompany you to cross the railway line. I found the special assistance excellent at Dawlish Station. There are also local, step free buses serve the town."
7796,There is a disabled toilet but again there are  access problems for wheelchair users.  The problem is that you must go up several stairs in order to get to the disabled loo.   The disabled toilet is spacious and does have an emergency red cord. See photo.
7797,Overall the staff and venue provide a good/enjoyable option and experience for this wheelchair user/companion.
7798,Very helpful!
7799,"From my point of view as a visually impaired person access was pretty good. My pal who uses a powerchair had a different view but still thought it was pretty good. The key to enjoying the visit to the Castle is to do your homework and get a sense of the layout and what there is to see. You can get a map which makes getting around easier. If you are a wheelchair user or have a mobility impairment then it's useful to know that there is a mobility vehicle that can take you from the esplanade up into the Castle.  Once you enter the Castle and Guardroom Square you are on cobbles so these may be a little tricky for some people.  You can pick up an audio guide when you get your ticket which is very helpful in setting the scene.  There is a lot to see so it's useful to leave yourself plenty of time for a visit.   You can visit the Palace where you follow a route through the various rooms. These are brought to life with actors playing period character roles. While you are here head up to the support Gallery to see the Stirling Heads gallery. There is a lift if you cannot manage the stairs. There's also a hand large print guide to the gallery as well.   Another spot to see is the Great Hall with its high vis outside paint and the amazing spacious interior. You can even sit on the 'throne' and get a selfie!  Oh yes, don't forget to explore the Vaults that are under the Palace. See where the lion lived and visit the access room where there are films, objects and activities to help with explaining the Castle. Handily there is an accessible loo adjacent to this room as well.  The castle also has a couple of gift shops as well as a cafe.  "

7801,Very helpful
7802,We drove but I understand there Is a bus service to Betchworth (not sure how close it gets to the pub).  Blue badge bay was right outside the entrance with easy access. I only deducted that half a star on a technicality as there is only one space.
7803,"There are accessible parking spaces in front of the visitors centre. Unfortunately the local train station is not accessible, so access by public transport is limited, but Scotrail will happily supply a taxi from the nearest accessible train station. "
7804,There are accessible toilets located on every floor and all are clearly sign posted. 
7805,Fine - on the same level as the entrance.
7806,"When I arrived at the festival my friends and other-half were already inside, as I'd been to visit other friends before joining them. When I asked the staff to help me find them, it wasn't an issue and they stayed with me until I could find my group. All staff were also very supportive when finding toilets and refreshments. "
7807,I didn't have much interaction with the staff as only bought a drink.
7808,Has small wheelchair lift for getting down the first few steps. Otherwise all flat
7809,"Staff exceptionally helpful. They are great with young ballet crowd, elderly chapel goers and us, proper unselfish conscious welcome. Menu amazing! Mega fresh cafe! BEST Welsh rarebit ever"
7810,"Access to the site is through the main ticketing gate, and there is a flat hard surface route to all buildings - and alternate routes are available to each area to avoid gravel or steps. I was able to get into all exhibitions while using a wheelchair using these alternative routes.  There are many individual buildings spread across the site including an art gallery, gift shop, coal house and the main building housing Northumbria Archives. They house some permanent exhibitions such as my personal favourite The Pitman Painters. All were accessible, and the staff are more than happy to help should you need additional help or information.  I have to point out The Pitman Painters exhibition especially for access as it included iPads to take around the room and find out more information about the paintings contained in the display.  It included extra information not available in the room, fully subtitled audio and video interviews and high-resolution images, so you get closer than anyone else to the paintings. For me, it’s the accessibility highlight of the entire venue!  Signs are mostly clear and well placed throughout the whole venue - again staff are helpful and can help you find the smaller exhibits if you get stuck!  There is a Cafe, Information Desk and Gift Shop in the main building and all are wheelchair friendly and have a portable loop at the point of sale or desk.   "
7811,"The Storytelling Centre presents a blend of old and new buildings that once inside offer an engaging space to visit, listen, learn, play and enjoy. All of which is designed to be as accessible as it can for everyone."
7812,"All the internet photos of hotel excited us enough to want us to visit this hotel, and approaching it looked very nice from the road, (photo 1) but what a disappointment for us, it is now tired looking, still in need of maintenance and a good paint job to try to brighten the place up. The approach towards hotel was not appealing enough for us (photo 2) and although a decent sized car park, (photo 3) the only disabled bays we could see where alongside the disabled chalets, but at least we could park close  enough to hotel entrance (photo 4). This has quite a steep ramp leading into hotel, but my wife who is my carer,  managed to push me up into hotel. The entrance to hotel is very basic, and reception area not at all inspiring (photo 5) Warmly greeted by friendly staff who did all they could to help us. Inside, the lounge had table and chairs, but no sofas to lounge on, and this serves as the bar area as well, (photo 6) big enough to get wheelchair around though. Lounge areas looked acceptable but did not excite us at all, The bar itself functions, (photo 7) but we had a nice cup of coffee. The restaurant again was very basic, nothing inspiring. (Photo 8) with pleasant seating under windows. (9)  If you like us are just visiting, then we need to use the public toilets, and you reach this down a very steep ramp, ( photo 10, the photo is misleading as it does not show how steep the ramp really is )  You cannot get a wheelchair in there, so I had to get up out of my wheelchair to be able to push open the door (11) and get into the toilet area, but it is just an ordinary toilet, with no disabled amenities  available, so no grab rails or pull cord, (12)  and I was concerned as it smelt a bit and I felt it needed cleaning, so in no way was I going to use the toilet. Going outside into corridor again, was of concern, with a very steep ramp to get up to bar area, and as I had gone to toilets on my own, it was a very hard struggle to get up ramp, so if you have to use toilet then have help to get you up inside hotel again. There are terrace areas to enjoy, but disabled could not use these areas, as steps to get up and down (photo 13)  There are disabled chalets available as separate from main hotel (photo 14) a good idea, with parking right outside your chalet, but they badly need redecorating and maintenance on the outside, the present grey colour does nothing to give appeal, it’s just a functional colour they used. there is a step to get up into narrow doorway, so you may need to get out of chair so that carer can help you get inside, then fold the chair up to carry in, but it will be difficult to find space to store it. The room itself is small and very little storage space. The bed is a standard double bed size, (photo 15) With a small open fronted wardrobe and a plain desk, with tea making facilities on it. (Photo 16). And the only other room is a walk in shower room and W.C (17). Our final thoughts. It was disappointing for us, as it looked so nice from the road, we were hoping for more. Restaurant and bar are very basic, uninspiring, simple bar like areas. The public toilets was of concern and care will be needed. The chalets are very small and basic, and we feel we would not be able to use this hotel ourselves with our need to use a wheelchair.  "
7813,They tried to help.
7814,"The staff are not greatly interested in their customers, and when I asked whether there was a lift to the basement, the response was just ""No"" - no apology, no explanation, no offer of other assistance (such as for example ""Is there anything you'd like me to fetch you from the basement for you to look at?"")."
7815,Lots of parking spaces good local transport
7816,"I used one of the toilets outside the viewing area though still in the arena. Plenty space in them and no problems at all for a powered chair. I would advise one thing, take your ticket with you!!! Schoolboy error, almost didn't get back in without my ticket!! :-D"
7817,"Used loo at City Hall and Marina. Access good, Spain tends not to have red cords. "
7818,"Most shops are very friendly ( I would particularly mention Cafe Nero). The jewellery shops, in general, tend to be a bit stuffy!"
7819,The accessible loo that I used was well laid out and modern. It lost points as the signage to find it was not that great. My observations have been noted by the bank and signage will be reviewed.
7820,I think most of the cottages had paved parking right outside.
7821,"I'm not sure about the nearest bus stop, but there is parking nearby. We walked from Queen Street Station which is about 10 minutes away. Staff are happy to book taxis and assist people into taxis where necessary."
7822,Big accessible loo but door was VERY heavy and hard to do on your own.   Has a radar key but staff in cloakroom (which is beside the loo) have one too and were b friendly and helpful.   Loo was very smelly though so pretty unpleasant.
7823,We drove and there was plenty of parking space. There were no designated spaces but it was easy to park around the back were the disabled entrance was. Not aware of any public transport.
7824,All staff were great
7825,Signage could be better as it suggests the lift to the accessible loo is in a different direction to what it actually is. Wheelchair lift down to loos with plenty of space in it. Not far from lift to accessible loo. Explanations within lift re: which floor to choose could be better.
7826,Signage is poor. Two hearing loops installed (one in each of the two halls) both were working. No portable loops.  Rachel came to village hall at 12-15 -  The two halls were not in use. The hearing loop system in both large and small halls were switched on separately. Both worked but the volume could have been greater. Rachel appreciated this ( her Mother has a hearing loss) and said she would contact the manufacturers. Signage needs to be larger and clearer.
7827,"Although there is no sign for a disabled toilet at reception, there is one with the other toilets just off reception.  The toilets were cleaner than they appear in the photo; there was room to manoeuvre, a grab rail but no red cord."
7828,Loo out of sight.Usually dirty.not much room inside but corridor suitable for wheelchair.
7829,"This is a leisure centre in Edinburgh that is split over three levels. It is just about wheelchair accessible, with lift access to the top floor, but is really quite cramped inside. "
7830,Staff are really eager to help and always around
7831,We walked but there were buses stopping close by.
7832,The Marlowe is a very modern theatre and as detailed below can offer a very good experience for the wheelchair patron. It all depends where you sit!  Rating 3
7833,There were parking facilities however it was extremely busy and there were not many spaces left. We had to park on the main road in which there may have not been enough room for a ramp to assemble from a vehicle.
7834,"Two disabled bays, but full, with no blue badge in sight. Although ground on the level, it did not look to safe, so stayed in car."
7835,We stayed for the weekend. We took my wife’s wheelchair and car boot mobility scooter. Both were fine for moving about the site - both inside and out. A bit more tricky if you wanted to go to the footpath by the adjoining Chichester Harbour.
7836,"Parked right at front door, as we were using Welcome.app the girl.came.out and asked if we needed any help..Automatic door and straight through to cafe. Had reserved a table.for.us as booked on Welcome app.."
7837,The shaded carport adjacent to the accessible flat works very well.
7838,Accessible access without stairs available at the bottom of the venue. A lot of the performance was done with BSL and had captioning on the screen. Absolutely amazing show by ZooCo called Sirens which covered a lot of hard hitting societal issues in a fun and thought-provoking manner. Would 100% see again!
7839,Very helpful. 
7840,The Restaurant has a door in from Coatbridge Main and one from the hotel area we used the door from the Main St. There is a glass door that is wide enough to let a wheelchair through this opens inwards and leads to a small square hall area that has double doors leading in to the Restaurant area once through these doors there is a small reception type desk. From the desk you will be lead to a table suitable for the size of the group.
7841,Level access to areas for wheelchair users. Few steps to my seat on sticks. Highest number of accessible seats in premiership by far! Well over the required legal minimum. Active Disabled supporters association.
7842,"From the main road there are no dropped kerbs so the powered wheelchair needs to be kept on the road to enable entry to the Pleasance Grand.  The staff are very helpful and if they see you in the wheelchair queuing to enter the venue they tend to take you past the crowd, up the ramp and get you seated first."
7843,Excellent - can't fault them. Very friendly and very helpful.
7844,"I used the Neatebox Welcome App to visit Double Tree Hilton to meet a friend, as a result they knew my requirements before I arrived, were notified when I was approaching and met me at the door.   Ricardo was very helpful and ensured that I had what I needed.  I met up with a friend using a motorised chair for a meeting and it was a very good experience.   Had a lovely Caesar salad and the very tasty Double Tree Biscuits.   "
7845,"No room for wheelchair in disabled toilet, had to use the whole womens toilet area with the main door shut."
7846,Only 1 accessible loo that is also used by the theatre in the same complex. The loo really does need upgrading as quite shabby and not a lot of room especially if a carer is needed.
7847,There is a loo that is big enough for a small mobility scooter but it's tight. It's better with a chair. It does have a handrail by the toilet but it's quite low. It is also through a push door before the actual toilet door which can be awkward to negotiate. 
7848,"I arrived in a taxi. There are disabled parking spaces at the front of the hotel. There is loose gravel at the front - quite large stone chips, which my TravelScoot's narrow wheels couldn't cope with. After about half an hour of faffing about I queried with the staff whether they might have a wheelchair to get me to the front steps (quite shallow and with banisters, so I could manage them). Staff sourced a wheelchair, but unfortunately it had a flat tyre and they didn't have the required connector. Eventually I was dragged to the stairs in the flat tyred wheelchair by a staff member, bless her!   Despite it having been explained in advance of the booking that I use a three wheeler scooter, staff were arranging a temporary ramp consisting of two narrow runners. Probably ok for a wheelchair but not for a three wheeler! I clambered up the steps with the aid of the banister and staff carried the TravelScoot up and in to the building for me.   In order to get up to the dining room there is a set of steps to negotiate. The height's about 4ft and a temporary ramp had been installed. Unfortunately it was so scarily steep that I needed someone to give me a shove to get me all the way up it, and to act as a human brake when coming back down.  You can drive right up to Cobbleheugh House, which is at the rear of the hotel. Its back door has a couple of shallow steps down from ground level (gates on either side to hold on to). Watch out for the broken surface and the reasonably high ledge to get in to the building. When inside there is reasonable room to manoeuvre. The doors are heavy and difficult to open when on a scooter."
7849,"A lovely gift shop and restaurant overlooking the sea. Great for a breakfast, coffee and cake or main meals. Flat access, spacious, carpark."
7850,All v friendly
7851,Staff were pleasant and helpful.
7852,The signage appeared clear and it was easy to find product.Being a DIY store I expected things to be difficult to negotiate and it wasn't. I saw an induction loop in operation.
7853,Dedicated parking at the front entrance of the hotel in the courtyard. Staff very helpful.
7854,"For a take away place - great! There is loads of space, the seating is all against the walls which means there is a big open space right up to the counter when you enter.   Unfortunately there is no suitable seating for a wheelchair user inside as they're all high tables with stools. It would be great if they added in a lower table!   There are only seven or so tables each that seat two so it's not a massive place..."
7855,"Access in and around the building:  The building sits in what looks to be a residential street. The signposting is not obvious but when you walk past the large entrance helps in finding your way.  Once inside it was bright and light which made getting around easier. As a visually impaired person lighting is important as are clues within the environment. Two large black lines on the floor help to point you toward the reception and the lifts.  The lifts were large and spacious and the buttons easy to operate.  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms:  The first thing I noticed about the accessible bedroom was getting in the door. The door locks were of the key card type but you didn’t have to struggle with find a slot; just hold the card on the lock and it opens.  Once inside the room there was lots of space to move around. The wet room was big and well lit.  There were audio and visual alarms in the rooms. A personal evacuation plan is discussed with guest on arrival.  Access in the dining area:  The dining room was back down on the ground floor level. With plenty of tables and chairs to choose from. Again, it was bright and light.  Access to other facilities:  The hotel had a small gym which had a range of equipment."
7856,Located on God's Blessings Lane (don't believe your Sat Nav). Ample parking and six unmonitored disabled bays by the entrance.
7857,There is a lot as disabled parking spaces around the hotel. I am not sure if there is public transport down to the hotel as I drove and the only thing that I would worry about if i hadn't is the train line that runs across the enternce of the Quay complex as I'm not sure my chair would have gone over it.
7858,taxi
7859,Staff are very friendly and can't do enough to help
7860,Wide doors and  parking spaces just near the  entrance door.
7861,The staff are very helpful and I had no problems getting the information I needed by lip reading. Whether they do it deliberately or naturally the staff face you and speak clearly giving you their full attention until the conversation is over.
7862,"The accessible toilet was near the checkouts and had a wide easy to manage door, grab rails, and plenty of space. It was clean and tidy. Dropped a point as the door was obstructed by abandoned shopping trolleys."
7863,Car park is separate from garden centre (not something that can be changed) but surface of car park around disabled spaces is poor and makes it difficult to move wheelchair around.
7864,There were some bits with cobblestones that the main building had automated door buttons everywhere. You have to go winners if you were a car because there are no dropped curbs
7865,Whole area has been redeveloped - mostly flat and pedestrianised and we had the impression that planners had taken on board accessibility.  The three restaurants visited were all wheelchair friendly.  Lots to do and see and green areas for just sitting and watching the world go by.   All on Kings Cross station's doorstep.
7866,"We were apprehensive going to a concert with our two sons who are wheelchair users. So many things could present as an issue but we had a fantastic experience. Friendly staff, plenty of accessible toilets, easy access, good seating (with no one blocking your view or standing in front of the wheelchair). Plenty of parking around the Arena."
7867,"I'm only allowed to award five stars maximum but I'd have liked to have given two sets of five stars for our visit and the folk we met. The ladies on the desk at the visitor centre were fabulous - not phased by my usual question of how accessible the experience is for wheelchair users. They talked through the visitor journey, where the loos were, what we could see, and how the tickets worked. Finishing by giving us a handy map to plot our way!  When we arrived at the house two cheery stewards met us. Explained how the tour route was accessible all the way through, the options for the audio guides and when I said I didn't 'get on' with audio guides offered a beautifully printed and easy to follow transcript for me to use. They were friendly, amusing and made such a big difference to our visit. Well done to team Abbotsford; particularly as all of these folk were volunteers!"
7868,"There are parking bays on the street that can be used for free with a Blue Badge. However, being the city centre, it’s very busy and they were often all taken up. There is discounted (via the hotel) parking in the NCP Glasshouse car park in Glassford Street a block or so away. Glasgow City Councils own website says Blue Badge users can park on double yellow lines but fails to say NOT in a no loading area, which this part of Queen Street is. As a result we got a parking ticket! Currently appealing!"
7869,"We were met outside the theatre by friendly helpful staff , who took us in by the dedicated route . We were shown the bar area and then taken to the disabled toilet which was roomy and spotless . We then were shown to our seats , my mobility scooter was then taken and stored until the performance ended , then we were escorted out of the theatre , brilliant service "
7870,transport able to drive right up to outside. caution with length of stay though.
7871,Very welcoming & informative. Plenty of staff on hand and offering to help. 
7872,"Enjoyable evening. Disabled parking was a bit of a let down but hopefully more get allocated soon. Staff were fantastic, friendly and very helpful. Comfortable viewing. Coffee shop there too"
7873,"Bus Service on this main route in and out of the City is  well provided in either direction, there is ample parking too."
7874,There are disabled parking spaces available outside the theatre and around Stratford town in nearby streets. However Stratford is always busy so these are often full. There is ample parking in nearby car parks.
7875,Accessible London Buses pass on two sides of the square.
7876,On site parking available
7877,Café was wheelchair friendly though the desk where you placed your order and where you paid wasn't at a lower level for wheelchair users. I could navigate my wheelchair around in the café okay - In some areas of the café the tables and chairs are quite close together but in other parts there is room to manoeuvre around. In the shop part of the garden centre (we didn't go into the pants section) the aisles and displays are very crammed together and it was very difficult for my carer to manoeuvre my wheelchair around and there where some part of the stair that where too inaccessible even for my narrow wheelchair.
7878,"Staff were great.  As mentioned before, they didn't interrupt us too many times even though it was a ""quiet"" Tuesday night.  We asked for a break after our mains before looking at the dessert menu.  We didn't have to ask again for the menu (as has happened before in other restaurants) but whilst we were chatting one of the waiters quietly and without fuss just placed the menu next to us.  We only had one check back during dinner - again in so many restaurants there is no communication between staff sometimes and you feel like you're being interrupted all the time - not here as the staff have got it spot on.  Good job guys!"
7879,The staff were helpful
7880,"The staff tried to be inclusive during the tour and were willing to answer any questions. The staff have a lot of explaining/ spiel while on the tour so patience is necessary! My only gripe is that we have visited many times when some staff have watched us struggle to manoeuvre through the entrance doors and doors into the toilet area. However, I'm sure if asked they would be willing to help."
7881,The Hotel is on the Esplanade over looking the sea and ferry terminal there are a number of steps from the pavement to the ground floor reception area.  There is only one lift for the hotel this covers all the floors including the basement. This is what they use as disability access as we were told when booking. please see disability access for more information
7882,There was plenty of parking spaces.
7883,Small shop with decent access for wheelchair.
7884,This is a small small theatre. It has a ramp or steps to the entrance. Inside the front row is step free. The other rows are accessed by a staircase with handrail. There are spaces for wheelchair users.
7885,Reception staff were helpful. As were a couple of the waiting staff who had a chat with us and were happy to speak to the chef with regard ingredients used in the meals . I needed to know this for my allergies 
7886,"The restaurant is directly  accessible from the street,  very spacious with wheelchair access available to seventy-five percent of the tables, with staff at hand to assist if required or move seats if needs be,"
7887,Access is via steps leading down from car park level.
7888,"There is a double bedroom with an ensuite bathroom which has a shower over the bath and the other room can be configured as a twin or a king-size double and the ensuite bathroom is a wet room with just enough space to manoeuvre a wheelchair.  The loo in the wetroom was very high. Grab rails by sink, loo and shower. No shower seat but they provide one if you ask. There are 360 degree views of all the rooms on the website so you can get a really good idea of what you're getting."
7889,New building with easy access.  Lift to all exhibition areas and lots of circulation space  Easy to see everything.  Ample casual seating around space as well as in cafe and restaurant.
7890,The staff were particularly helpful and friendly. They frequently brought drink refills to the table and were very observant. Some staff were making balloon animals for the children in the restaurant which was nice.
7891,This is a great little cafe inside Discovery point in Dundee. Great access and lovely staff!
7892,"Very Good has lift inside the pub to chose whether you eat upstairs or down, very spacious"
7893,Even surfaces throughout and hall-way to rooms are wide enough. Didn't see any steps anywhere.
7894,"Access in and around the building  I found getting in the building fairly easy. There are some steps up to the front entrance which has a glass surround. There is a hand rail to the side of the steps.  Once inside it was bright and light and the main areas distinct enough to be able to get a sense of what is where once it was explained.  The lighting was good and the lifts were easy to find, large and well labelled. Once up on the bedroom level the corridors were easy to follow and find the room. I particularly liked the key card system as you touched the card to the door handle area and the door unlocked. Great for me as it’s tricky working out which way around the usual swipe style cards go!  Access in the accessible bedrooms and bathrooms  Once in the room it was spacious and well lit. It worked well for me as I was able to see well enough not to be fumbling around trying to work out what was where and how things worked. The bathroom was bright, light and spacious.  The fire alarm system in the room has a flashing alert as well as the audible signal. Staff will discuss a personal evacuation plan when you check in.  Access in the dining area  The dining area was near to the bar and it was easy to find. The colours and décor were good contrast. Menus are available in braille or large print by prior arrangement.  Access to other facilities  The lounge on each floor was a great idea as you could sit and look down toward the street and get a sense of the atmosphere,"
7895,"Nearest parking is available in the Angel Hill car park (free with Blue badge), Ram Meadow (pay but with additional time given) and behind the Premier Inn. There is also some nearby disabled bays (near the police station).    There is a train station in Bury St Edmunds. It is the other side of town, so probably a 30 minute walk. There is a bus station in town approx 15 minute walk."
7896,Down a farm track and parking to the left with loose chickens out. The paving is gravel so might need to be careful.
7897,Okay parked without any bother
7898,It is level access to the store. Automatic doors open to let you in. There  is plenty of space to manoeuvre.
7899,"The hotel can arrange door to door transport at extra cost, we did not use this. There is parking at the rear of the hotel. When the car park is busy it is possible that cars will need to be parked one behind another, however, if your car is parked at the back, reception ask that you leave your car key so that if the car in front needs to be moved & you are not available, they can do this. This is a reasonable request. Most of the hotels have small car parks & this seems to be standard practice. When we were staying the car park was quiet. There are dropped curbs from the car park into reception."
7900,"The Barbican Centre is an arts venue which contains cinema, theatre, 2 art galleries, exhibition halls, conservatory, library and restaurants.  This review is specifically about my visit on Disabled Access Day 2019 where there were disabled musicians performing throughout the day and the day ended with a panel discussion. "
7901,Everyone very helpful.
7902,"The front entrance is flat, the exterior doors both need to be opened for a wheelchair user to access, and the interior doors are wide enough for one to be opened, both are glass, which staff are quick to assist with.  It would be advisable to book, as there are limited seats/tables that would be easily accessed by wheelchair users.  The bar area has the high tables/stools which are not accessible (a trend that I don't like)."
7903,The bouncers and staff seem like a sound bunch here.
7904,Plenty of disabled parking bays near the entrance.
7905,The corridor to the loo was nice and wide. The door to the loo could present a problem to users if unaccompanied as it was a turn handle opener. It was nice and clean inside with grab rails and a red cord but unfortunately I was unable to manoeuvre due to the size of my powerchair (or the lack of space). This may not have been a problem for smaller or manual chairs. 
7906,This Cafe Nero is located in the town centre and there is some parking in nearby streets. There is disabled parking within the Thistle shopping centre multi storey car park which is about 15 mins away. Stirling rail and bus stations are about 10-15 minutes away. 
7907,Nice wide step free entrance!
7908,"All main pathways that you follow for the Enchanted Forest in Faskally Woods are resurfaced to accommodate individuals with mobility issues. When I went I was expecting the occasionally tree roots on the pathways, however there were no issues. The main bumps that I encountered were the wire protectors they used throughout the forest for the lights and even then, I have driven over bigger ones that they had (see image below). There are a few steeper gradients that you go up and down, but there are plenty of stewards around to help if you need it. Also, if you are like me and have minimal upper body strength then you may need support going down these gradients because with the issue of these pathway sections being a little steep there are also a few bumps.  There is also a bridge that you go across twice throughout your walk and I needed support on my chest to go down this as it was a couple of inches higher than the pathway.  For the two main shows that were on this year there was a viewing platform for both. Here there was a designated area where people with prams, in wheelchairs and people with other impairments are given priority. The barrier may still be too high for people; however, I think this is needed for safety and most of the light shows are higher up in the forest trees.  There are some areas of the Enchanted Forest that have bark laid down which for me I know the wheels of my powerchair would just spin in so I didn’t even try it. These areas were two light scenes which I could see from the pathway, a food area, where they sold the merchandise and the story telling hut. One of the light shows was interactive. However, the way I see it is that I managed the majority of the light show, more than I thought I would, so missing out on a couple of things I didn’t mind.   I don’t know much about visual impairments however; the pathways are quite dark and there are embankments at the edge of the pathways with a single rope to highlight the edge. It is recommended on the website that you don’t attend the Enchanted Forest if you have photo-sensitive epilepsy."
7909,"Getting around Copenhagen is relatively easy there are good, regular bus and metro services. Bikes are very popular and there are often special bicycle lanes. Some of the pavements are cobblestone, but usually where that is there are smoothed parallel paved stripes which make it easier to walk/ wheel on.  At the traffic lights I noticed most admitted a tone, which speeded up when the green man came on. The area is generally flat. The Little Mermaid is very small, and unassuming.  Tivoli amusement park has step free access to its delightful grounds and gardens and a couple of accessible rides and is well worth visiting (see separate review),   Christiansborg  Palace, is just one of the many royal palaces in Denmark, it has step free access to its state rooms and stables (see separate review). Amalienborg Palace is another royal palace and where Changing of the Guards take place.   Nyhavn with its harbour, colourful former warehouses and lovely cafes is a great place to relax and soak up the atmosphere. One side of the canal is busier than the other and the quieter side doesn't have cobblestones. There is also a lot of art and cultural things to see including the Glyptotek, a gallery with European, Egyptian, Greek and Roman artwork founded by the Carlsberg brewing family (see separate review). There is also 60 minute boat tours, suitable for some people with mobility difficulties, where you can see many historic and contemporary sites (see separate review). The beautifully maintain and tranquil King's Gardens is the largest of Copenhagen's parks (see separate review). The city centre, where most of the tourist attractions are located, is relatively small. If you choose a city centre hotel it should be easy to get about. "
7910,Really good generally - can't fault the main hall.  The Lantern (previously known as 'Hall 2') is not quite so good as there is a silly stairlift system and you have to navigate two of the slow kind of lifts to get to the loo.
7911,La Route du Sel  had a toilet but it there was a step to get to it and there were no grab rails in the toilet. I'm unable to comment about other toilets in the village.
7912,We drove there and used one of the two blue badge holder parking spaces. 
7913,There are a couple of disabled spaces how ever not many. These are located at the front of the restaurant. There is a bus stop a road away from this restaurant however it does have a steep incline from the bus stop up to the restaurant. 
7914,"There's only street parking or multistory car parking, which can be a problem if you have a large wheelchair accessible vehicle."
7915,The staff on the reception are friendly and helpful also the fitness and gym instructors are very knowledgeable about health and fitness and are always on hand to give advice and offer assistance when visiting the centre. 
7916,"Whilst the toilets themselves were nice, clean and spacious, they were hard to find. No clear signage could be seen by us. But there are accessible toilets within easy reach of the lifts and the red cords hang to the floor. "
7917,US Capitol  is one of the most iconic buildings in Washington DC. I would say it’s a must see. Entrance was free. Once we got through security ( for prohibited 🚫 items see https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/plan-visit/prohibited-items )’we made our way to the tour (45 mins long). I would suggest that you pre-book your place on a tour on the Capitol Hill website to avoid queuing ( https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/plan-visit/book-tour-capitol). The tour was packed with information about the history of the building and the congress. After the tour we spent 45 mins !!!!! queuing to go into the senate gallery ( https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/plan-visit/watching-congress-session). I am not sure it was worth the wait. We then had a quick snack in the large cafeteria that had a selection of basic hot/cold/sweet and savoury food. Overall I would say the building was extremely accessible and I would definitely recommend visiting it. More details about accessibility to follow.
7918,The number 8 bus goes down Broughton Street 
7919,There are disabled bays outside the store they are wide but they don't have very clear markings.  Several buses run near the store and there are pedestrian crossings. 
7920,3 disabled parking spaces at the door. You would need a car to get there
7921,"Wide ramp to entrance.  Seating throughout the galleries for a rest. Large print labels available as hand-outs in the galleries.  Lift to other floors was ancient and had heavy grill and door to heave into place. It is going to be vastly improved with new larger lift.  Good signage throughout, being improved again during the building project.  Induction loop being installed at welcome desk.  "
7922,"No steps, access up quite a steep slope. Corridors quite narrow, there is a lift, but we were on ground floor. Narrow corridors made opening and closing doors difficult if my friend was pushing my chair, she couldn't get past the chair to the door"
7923,We got their via DLR and Underground from Greenwich. Got off at South Kensington and walked for about seven minutes through the covered walkway and through the museums underground entrance. The exhibition was about a three minute walk away.
7924,Absolutely perfect at the restaurant part but a lot of people don't know there is another one at the opposite side of the store - it could maybe be signposted somewhere the front entrance or at checkouts.
7925,"My first visit to this cinema and it didn't disappoint! Friendly staff, great access, excellent seats, AMAZING screen and audio... Just a shame that I didn't get to pick the movie!"
7926,"The access is great, level access  from the street direct into the hotel with lift access to the bedrooms."
7927,Signage in the store is good and there's plenty of staff around to ask where things are and they're often happy to take you where you need to be or find products. To go upstairs there is a escalator which you can take your shopping trolly on but it's not suitable for wheelchairs/power chairs/mobilities scooters or if you have poor balance. There is a lift at the back of the store to take you upstairs. There are manual and mobility scooters to borrow and also trollies with seats for older children with disabilities. The aisles are wide and most of the time they are kept clear though there is the occasional cart where staff are putting products up on the shelves. The beauty section and clothing section the aisles are a bit close together and a bit jumbled up so its hard to navigate around. In the café it's easy to navigate around the tables and chairs thought he serving desk is a bit high up if you're in a wheelchair.
7928,"Gorgeous little restaurant with lovely staff.  My dad and I visited on Christmas day for their special Christmas menu (I was excited so already had my choice ready!).  I managed to get parked as close to the door as possible which was great, there is a big step up to the front door, but a portable ramp had been put down for another guest so I used it.  The staff did say if I mentioned when booking they'd make sure it was there.  The dining areas are a little snug but they had made a special space for the lady in a wheelchair.  As I was on my crutches I fine and there was plenty room at my table.  My visit to the ladies was a bit eventful as there was a mahoosive (it is a word!) step up to the toilets.  I had to get my dad's help only to discover when returning to my table that there was another portable ramp I could have asked for (only found out as the lady in a wheelchair needed it).  The toilet isn't wheelchair accessible at all hence the star off.  The lovely food made up for the lack of accessibility, I even ate prunes and enjoyed them!"
7929,"Think 1950s icecream parlour.... a relaxed and quirky vibe with many, many flavours of the most delicious ice cream that I've tasted. There is also savoury food (I had a crepe with avocado and tomato), hot dogs, chilli etc, along with decent coffee or alcohol if you prefer. Oh yes, and it is wheelchair accessible with a decent loo and no fuss made. The waiter discretely removed a chair for me and we could concentrate on the important business of choosing he food."
7930,Its in the centre of town meaning parking is difficult and during certain times in summer would be almost impossible.
7931,There was an accessible toilet by the other toilets. Fairly large but not big enough to transfer from the right hand side.
7932,"Up stairs.  As a wheelchair user, unable to reach them."
7933,"I have been there at least 3 times and every time there is something different to see. Great place to go with the family. Museum stuff usually run educational talks from time to time so go on their website if you wish, I would highly recommend doing so. "
7934,"Discovery Museum is just outside of the city centre, it has lots of interactive displays and great accessibility throughout."
7935,"A lovely place where we often go for lunch in their fantastic restaurant. On leaving I needed to use the toilet and since I`d had a stroke 6 weeks ago, used the `disabled` one. On entering the main entrance to the toilet area was `mother and baby` and right down at the furthest point was the disabled one,  surely these would benefit from being the other way round?  Once inside the  rail that surely should fold down, didn`t,  so there was nothing to help me lower myself onto the loo which I felt was far too low down for any disabled users. I will think twice before visiting again ,  just in case I need to go. "
7936,Ramp to front door. Doors are wide but you might need help opening them if you are in a wheelchair.
7937,Level access  from car park to venue and restaurant and disabled toilets. There are step levels in the restaurant but ask for level access for a wheelchair user. 
7938,Kilmurrys is the old Newlands post office. They have made great use of a limited space. The tables inside are quite close together but a member of staff got me a suitable table. There is seating outside for alfresco dining when weather permits [you have to remember we are in Glasgow]. 
7939,"Once inside the place is level. There are displays and shelves to negotiate though so care needed, but there's plenty of space to get a chair through. The outside seating has two levels - the upper level is directly accessed from the tearoom. The lower level is accessed via a ramp which is quite steep but manageable. The patio is paved. There's plenty of room inside the cafe and farm shop to manoeuvre a chair.  The steep ramp up to the shop door is an issue as is the sprung front door - very hard for carer to hold or for a disabled person to manage. There are double doors from shop to tearoom - one open and the 2nd one is easy to open to get a chair through."
7940,"There is a large public car park just next to the cinema. It has a number of marked disabled bays. Otherwise you have to pay at ticket machine to park, but it is a set rate of a couple of pounds for a full day's parking, so is very reasonable.  The cinema is also very close to the train station, and there are local buses too. "
7941,"I had a great experience here! My partner and I are both autistic manual wheelchair users (although I have a power assist), and I am also deaf. I loved the size of the lifts at this museum and also really enjoyed that all videos were subtitled with the majority having BSL interpretation. On the downside, the interactive screens were really difficult to use (I don't know if this was just the calibration, but this definitely needs to be sorted) which made it really difficult for wheelchair users or those with physical disabilities to use. However, everything was very open plan and all doors being power-assisted made such a difference! I noticed there was definitely a lot of thought into the access, such as low tables with space under for wheelchair for all the videos displayed, the power-assisted doors, induction loops, textphone, and BSL use."
7942,Many disabled slots all on the fkat
7943,Easily accessible location for wheelchair users
7944,At all the gates and at all the camps we saw dedicated disabled parking bays. You can only really get to the Kruger National Park using a car - and except for designated areas - for obvious reasons you have to stay in the car when you're there! 
7945,"Good access with no steps or inclines. Suitable for wheelchairs, with an Easy Access route specifically designed for wheelchair users.  Every Thursday morning a local charity offers for hire a range cycles adapted for use by people with a range of disabilities.  "
7946,Staff were very welcoming welcoming and friendly
7947,"Brilliant accessible toilet (see attached photo below) behind the souvenir shop which you enter via a side-door in Westminster Hall. Everything in the toilet perfectly designed and laid out, and the red emergency cord was not tied up - five stars!"
7948,"One accessible loo next to reception, loo in room not particularly."
7949,"I am a season ticket holder at Inverness CT and obviously love Caley Thistle but I have to be honest that the accessibility is not great. First of, It can be hard buying a ticket if you're not registered with the club as being a wheelchair user. You have to be registered with the club (unless you're a away supporter) if you are wanting to get a ticket so bare that in mind. "
7950,"When checking in we were asked a lot of questions about what help I needed in an emergency.  As my husband was with me I didn't need any extra help but I thought this was a great idea. We were also offered instructions in Braille or large print . Also we were asked if we needed a vibrating pillow which would go off in an emergency - fantastic idea! Used your roomkey to pass reception.  2 lifts to all floors. Excellent room which had a wider door with 2 peep holes- one at wheelchair height. Wetroom was perfect with lots of grab rails, a lower sink, lower mirror, large comfortable fold down shower seat. Even the soap dispensers were lower down. The bedroom area had plenty of room to manoeuvre my wheelchair and the clothes hangers were lower than normal. Large comfortable bed with a panic button at one side. We paid for wifi for our stay. Lounge/dining area beside reception where we had breakfast but lunches and evening meals are also available.  Only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is I had booked 3 rooms , one for myself and husband, one for my mum and one for my father-in-law and when we checked in my mum had been put on a different floor to the other 2 rooms and as shes in her 80's she was a bit worried about it "
7951,"The car park is huge and plenty of room 2 get in and out of the cars. I didnt, however, notice if they had specific areas 4 disabled parking. We managed fine without it."
7952,"I'd been on to venue staff before the tickets went on sale and from then to the end of the gig  they were very helpful.  However I docked half a point for one guy. The guy who advised me not to be in the standing area did so to my friend. Tut tut. There's nothing wrong with my understanding or hearing,  man.   This was my only tiny negative experience the entire time. "
7953,"There are two great changing place toilets within the Capability Scotland building, these are fully equipped with a hoist, bench and privacy curtain. Toilet is placed in the center of the wall which means that if you are able to transfer yourself.  The only problems I had were that I couldn't reach the lock and open button for the door with the toilet because the radiator was in the way, but I would have someone with me to help, not sure if others in wheelchairs would manage. Also I struggled to reach the sink. But I am delighted there are more changing place toilets available, it is open 9am until 5pm Monday till Friday."
7954,"Prague Zoo is the 5th best zoo in Europe and is an amazing attraction for all the family to enjoy.  There is over 150 exhibits including 144 endangered species as well as other mammals, birds and reptiles. The zoo is accessible by car and there is a large car park that can accommodate around 850 cars.  Individuals with a disabled badge can park for free as well as getting 25% off admission price and carers can access the zoo for free. The zoo offers a variety of food from restaurants to refreshment stands, all at very good prices. "
7955,All paths are wheelchair accessible but there are a lot of steep natural inclines which can make it difficult at times.
7956,No transport for disabled - bare minimum disabled parking 
7957,"Lovely, large accessible loo in a corridor leading off of the main restaurant. It was very clean and modern, and there was a clear pathway leading up to it."
7958,Some parking outside. A few buses go through Stockbridge.
7959,"The ticket area and entrance hall is accessible. A large lift takes you up to the first floor where the Gallery is housed. Once there you find ample space to move around, helpful staff and a good experience."
7960,Polite but seemed not that bothered that I couldn't go to the toilet.
7961,"Very cheerful, and one employee even went through the history of the building and garden whilst we were sitting and enjoying the garden."
7962,"Public transport to the gardens is very accessible. King's Cross is the nearest tube and train station and both are step free. From the tube/ train station it's an easy, step free short walk straight down Gray's Inn Road. The gardens are on your left and directly opposite is Westminster Kingsway College. It should take about 5 - 10 minutes depending on your speed.  From King's Cross you can also take the bus number 46 from outside of King's Cross Station. Alternatively there is bus number 17 which stops in Caledonian Road. Both buses stop directly outside the gardens and the stop is called Heathcote Street. If you are travelling from King's Cross, due to the one way system, buses are unable to go directly down Gray's Inn Road, so the bus takes a longer way round and the stop is the second or third after King's Cross Station.  On a bus back to King's Cross, the number 17 stops in York Way, next to King's Cross Train Station, whereas the number 46 stops in Pancras Road, the road in between King's Cross and St Pancras Stations.  Travelling north on the number 17 or 46, from the City of London or Holborn, exit at Eastman Dental Hospital bus stop and then continue north in the direction of the bus and the gardens are on your right hand side."
7963,"Essentially cricket training and spectating venue with entertaining space separate hired out to public, when doing so spectators / parents have to use the disabled WC as access to public wcs is on 1st floor which is where the entertainment hall is. Hence queue for Wc, as numerous parents/ siblings use disabled Wc. They can’t use the ones on the changing rooms due to safeguarding policy, which is totally understandable but to remove access to the public ones on first floor is ludicrous and puts unacceptable volume through the disabled Wc. It was pointed out there are 2 disabled wcs. So I suggested two disabled persons wouldn’t need use at the same time? Also, second disabled Wc is through a set of heavy hinged fire doors. Disabled bays constantly used by others or People park at top of the pedestrian slope preventing chair access so they can wheel their sports equipment down"
7964,There are plenty of disabled spaces close to the entrance but for those without disabled badges there are plenty of car spaces available.
7965,From the moment we entered the venue we were on plastic 'decking' so it made it easy to get around - it had slanting edges so wasn't a trip hazard either. The accessible viewing area was well signposted. The platform was spacious and had great sightlines - it had folding chairs so people could arrange themselves as they wished. There was a chap with a cool bag on the platform so you could get drinks almost without leaving your seat. There was also a wheelchair charging point on the platform. You could tell a lot of thought had gone into disabled access at the festival! It's worth noting that we visited on a dry summer's day so I'm sure that we would have found it a little more tricky in torrential rain.
7966,"Good size toilets with left transfer, hand dryer would be better as well as as a bigger lock indoors for those with difficulties."
7967,Great visit to the scene of WW2 war cabinet offices and rooms under Whitehall. Could spend a whole day if you read and watched everything. A great audioguide lead you round and really brought it to life. Free for a carer and reduced for disabled. 
7968,Very spacious and clean. The one downstairs in the basement is best
7969,"There were plenty accessible toilets onboard. Some were automatic sliding doors that you had to push the button to open/close/lock them, the others were just the normal manual doors. There was good space in each of them."
7970,"My husband dropped me, there is a small are for stopping but not parking on the Mound."
7971,"there is a disabled toilet and they are very clean, tidy and room for a carer."
7972,"There is one disabled toilet located at the back of the bar. Access to the toilet is clear with no obstructions. There are two grab rails positioned around the toilet. Both attached to the back wall on the right hand side (when facing the toilet). There is a cord hanging from the ceiling on the left hand side of the toilet (again, when facing it) for use as an alarm. The sink is low enough for easy access and it a reasonable sized toilet with a sufficient amount of space."
7973,"There is no car park and it is on a pedestrian street, the nearest train stations are Queen street and Central, there are also several bus stops near by and the closest Subway stations are Buchanan Street and St Enochs."
7974,An accessible loo was adjacent to the harbour side.
7975,Just above the Metro St James. Two public car parks across the road. 
7976,"The Tullie has a small tarmacked car park (probably less than 20 spaces.) It has has one disabled space. There is, however, public parking across the road and there are bigger public car parks further along the road. The inn is a couple of minutes walk from the railway station and there is also a bus station about five minutes walk away."
7977,"Buchanan Galleries has two entrances that are suitable for people who are in wheelchairs. The first entrance is a steady slope nearest John Lewis in the shopping centre. This entrance has a variety of wide doors which allows access for people in wheelchairs. However these doors are not automatic meaning people who are in need of assistance, but do not have the assistance may find it difficult to enter the shopping centre. The second entrance at the top of Buchanan Street has several stairs with another set of heavy doors. There is a ramp put in place at the edge of said stairs with a wide set of automatic doors.   There are a set of lifts available for people on the ground floor of the shopping centre, which allows people access to every floor.  "
7978,The Museum is accessible from the main street through a courtyard. There is a ramp and there are doors to enter so that you don't have to navigate the revolving door. The galleries themselves are spacious and each floor is step free. The one thing that may be an issue to some people is that the public lift that we were directed too had very narrow doors. There was a manual wheelchair that was located right next to reception that you can borrow. There is also an audio tour that you can take around with you for more information on the artwork.
7979,Two accessible toilets available of differing layouts and sizes.
7980,"Good staff, friendly & helpful."
7981,"The museum is in the centre of Corfu Town and is housed in the first floor of a historic town house. The ticket office is on the ground floor and there is a desk at standing height. There are 12 steps with handrails on both sides, see photo, to reach the museum. The stairs curve towards the top, however this was not a problem as the museum was not busy and I could take my time.  A guide escorts you round the museum and gives commentary in English and is very informative. He re-creates how life would have been like in the 1800s. There are a couple of places where there is a small ramp to the next room and in the re-created cellar there are 2 steps down, this is the last stop on the tour.   There are a couple of chairs where I could rest as I went around. "
7982,"The toilets are at the back of the cafe, you have to be able to get past both the queue of people getting served, and a row of tables on your other side. Bit of a tight squeeze!  There are two toilets, both of which are accessible but are also intended for all customers to use. Therefore there was a queue to use them - which is ok if you are able to wait. The toilet had accessible features, but wasn't really that user friendly. The emergency cord was wrapped round the raised grab-bar and tied together, meaning neither of these things could be used. The toilet -roll dispenser was empty and the container was lying open (so was in the way). There were spare toilet rolls sitting on the back of the toilet, which were fine for people with good mobility to reach, however as this was an accessible toilet would have been out of the reach of many. A little bit more awareness would mean these things could easily be improved."
7983,Lots of parking at the villa all on block paving so no issues when using a wheelchair. I would recommend renting the WAV or a car for non disabled people. The village is only 10 minutes away in the wheelchair. There is no public transport.
7984,"This is the second time I've been to BST Hyde Park and it was just as good - if not better! - than our previous visit. The set up is great, the staff have obviously had some great staff training and even the loos are good! The only difficultly for us was the drop off / pick up as my pal's powerchair is too big for the accessibility vehicle so we had to go through Hyde Park - but that has tarmac paths so whilst it is a fair distance it is definitely do-able!"
7985,"This is a stunning hotel, which is accessible (to a point) and offers fantastic food, relaxation and 5 star customer service. A must visit for anyone in the area...............oh and it's owned by Scotland's own Andy Murray."
7986,I did not check the toilets on this visit. I am told there is a new accessible lift on the second floor by the cafe. I gave tha manager a couple of Euan's red cord cards. I will check next visit. 
7987,Disabled parking very close to main entrance to cinema
7988,"Cameron Toll Shopping Center on the multi junction site of the A7, A68, A701, 702 is a shopping retain Park, formerly known as Savacenter. It’s predominant outlet has been Sainsbury’s - which at one time was the largest in Scotland, it has a large Boots the Chemist and an Aldi, an indoor seated Greggs, Costa and a Thornton’s, with additional seating in their own areas in the mall. There are other electrical, jewellery, clothing, stationary, shoe and leathers repairs with other independent outlets. It’s all on one level after Access is via ramped areas from the bus stop locations which service South Edinburgh the Borders and the RIE campus at Little France. The large car park is also on one level. There is considerable space for parking which includes Disabled parking at the Old Dalkeith Road entrance and exit and the Cameron Toll itself. There is also a Fuel and LPG station on site, with a sit in / drive thru McDonald ‘s and KFC. Toilets are fully equipped, regularly serviced and also have a RADAR key facility. The retail part of the Centre is on one level with no ramps required, the upper level accessed by left is occupied by a Puregym site. There is also a posting box. It’s large, spacious and completely adequate for power scooters, chairs and assistance dogs are welcome, Costa and Sainsbury’s have their own toilets which are equipped and accessible given their catering provision."
7989,"The Sill is the National Landscape Discovery Centre at Once Brewed, near Hadrian’s Wall. Opened last year, The Sill has a permanent exhibition about the landscape and our relationship with it as well as temporary exhibitions - the current one is about Dark Skies and preventing light pollution. It is very interactive but I think they could have incorporated a little bit more detail into the landscape exhibition without spoiling the child-friendliness. The whole place has been designed with accessibility in mind: automatic doors, a lift with audio announcements and Braille signs, accessible loos, even a changing-places area with shower. There are plenty of seats, the reception desk had a lowered section and staff were really helpful. Outside there are plenty of Blue Badge spaces as well as bike racks and a bus stop outside. There is information about all the accessibility features on their website. The café, which specialises in local produce, is on the first floor, accessible by lift and is light and airy with great views over the countryside. We just had a sandwich, which was great and very generous, but I can’t comment comprehensively on the menu, however it did all look good! There is a path from ground level right up to the garden roof and you can also access it from the café. There is a hard surface, but it was rather juddery so I didn’t fancy venturing too far on it but the views even from this level were good. From the roof they must be fabulous! "
7990,Perfectly friendly
7991,The staff are very helpful and friendly.  Nothing is too much trouble.
7992,"No signage, but if you ask staff they’ll advise you where they are( at the back of the store) Clean and tidy, plenty of grabrails, room to manoeuvre and for a carer. "
7993,Good ramp not sloppy in rain
7994,There is a step but as I said they’re looking into getting a ramp
7995,"The 21km trail around Loch Leven is a great walk for all the family, or bike ride.  The wheelchair friendly path is pretty much flat and smooth. It mainly follows the edge of the loch, a few bits venture through fields.  There's a short climb up to the viewpoint near East Brackley, nicely  broken up by a few switch backs (bit tight for bikes but easy for wheelchairs), the view at the top is definitely worth the effort. We went as far as the Vane Farm (just over 1/3 of the way) underpass.  Very disappointed that it wasn't wheelchair accessible due to the two flights of stairs that need negotiated.  "
7996,"Fort Nelson is a restored Victorian fort, placed on the top of portsdown hill overlooking Portsmouth harbor. It gives an exciting incite to what cannons and fortifications where used to protect the south coast. With its secret underground tunnels, ammunition bunkers and 19 acres of ramparts and fortifications , you are able to discover what it is like to live in this Victorian garrison including the kitchen and hospital. There are daily guided tours and at 1 pm the firing of a 2nd world war 25-pounder gun. Plus its free admission. For further information visit,  https://royalarmouries.org/visit-us/fort-nelson/ "
7997,There were two of us very obviously disabled but no one asked if we wanted to order. We had to drag ourselves to the counter. It was not busy so it would have been a simple courtesy to ask if we needed help. 
7998,"It's fine getting around, although don't expect to get out on the open deck. Transferring from my scooter to one of the fixed seat and table arrangements was a bit tricky."
7999,Well signposted loo with wide door and hand rails
8000,Always love popular tourist destinations... Excellent buildings/light shows etcSingapour is one of those places. Nice and flat. English is the norm and accessible buses + public transport is good. I felt safe as a solo wheelchair traveller. 
8001,Fantastic parking directly outside the store with lots of spaces available.
8002,Staff were helpful and informative.
8003,"Wooden old shed, in need of work, no actual disabled toilet, just same as public use, it does have a grab rail, but, well, look at photos."
8004,Level access into the venue. Most chairs are moveable so pretty straightforward getting a space. Could be trickier at a busier time though.
8005,"Lots of wheelchair access but no visible loop system for very quiet auditory experience (in temporary display gallery). Lighting dim, making pictures harder to see. Many exhibits raised up above height of wheelchair user. However, staff very welcoming and helpful, 2 manual wheelchairs to borrow, building majority slopes not steps."
8006,Loved coming here and soaking in the view over Coniston. Great food for lunch with friendly staff. Automatic doors with accessible toilet...  Would recommend & visit again!
8007,"The accessible and Changing Places toilets are open on each level. They were extremely clean and tidy. They are spacious, with grab rails and emergency cords which reach to the floor. In the Changing Places toilet there is a sign saying that toilet can be flushed manually or operating the touchless controls you can activate the wash/ dry mechanism. While I was there I couldn't get it to work (and I did report this). There should be a mechanism to squirt water to wash you and then a drier comes on.  This maybe really useful for people who find it difficult to wipe their bottom. "
8008,We where greeted by the door by a friendly staff member who directed us to the lift.  
8009,"You passed the loo on the way to our seats. It was clearly signposted, clean, spacious with grab rails and for once at a football stadium hot water. The automatic soap dispenser was a bonus!"
8010,Directly on the beach. There are a number of accesible buses that stop very close by.
8011,Access to the Horse Guards Parade is level and easily approached from the adjacent pavement. The surface is gravelled and may make it hard for some wheelchair users to negotiate.
8012,I really enjoy walking through West Princes Street Gardens! The paths are wide and smooth and you can avoid the steep hills into the garden by entering via King's Stables Road. In the summer months they have deck chairs dotted around on the grass.
8013,It was great to see an accessible loo in such a restaurant. Clean and not cluttered.
8014,"Private, charged car park is unexpected and unwelcome. Buses from Doncaster and Rotherham stop in the village."
8015,"Good, but one misses Lothian Buses' power-operated ramps. The double doors are wide and the wheelchair/buggy spaces just inside them. This 66 year-old accompanist was able to get wife & wheelchair on and off buses without the need of a ramp. A ramp would be essential for solo wheelchair users and power chair users."
8016,Accessible toilet in both our room and the pool area. Lots of space and grab rails.
8017,"We went to this show/event expecting something similar to the Enchanted Forest (an event we love and have been to many times).  In fact, it was a lot more like an immersive theatre performance than a light display.  Yes, there were some pretty lights, although not anything like the scale of Enchanted Forest or the Edinburgh Botanics lights, and we weren't encouraged to dwell and watch them.  It was difficult to figure out what this event was from the website.  It's in fact a long walk through a forest where actors occassionally jump out at you, pretending to be either Roman soldiers or Scottish Picts.  It was amusing, but I can't see how they can stay in business given the large number of actors.  The acting quality was what you'd expect from good drama students, or as an aside but as a complete show it was lacking somewhat.  The cast also scared young children who were next to us by talking about Picts dismembering and decapitating those who roamed the forest.  A theatre performance has failed if the actors have to reassure children by saying that it's just pretend.  MY ten year old was fine, but I would advise against taking children younger than this.  In terms of accessibility, the organisers have not thought about this in the slightest.  We were directed to 'disabled' parking that was further away down a hill than the normal parking, and then asked to walk up a steep and muddy grassy verge.  The route is extremely long, with little feedback of how far you've walked or how long you still have to go.  Several times we thought we were nearing the end and then found ourselves back in the centre area.  My son is a wheelchair user but choose to use his walker instead, having successfully walked round Enchanted Forest.  I would estimate the route is at least three or four times the distance.  My son did very well but eventually he had to sit on the edge of the frame while we pushed him.  We also missed parts of performances because it took us so long to catch up with our group.  The route is extremely muddy at points, and very steep at points.  We were escorted around the route by a yellow-jacketed member of staff with a torch showing us the muddy puddles and places where the path had a steep and unprotected edge.  At one point a second staff member joined us as we walked down a steep hill approximately 30-45%.  They were there to catch us if we slipped!  At times we were diverted to a different route but ended up walking up muddy verges with tree roots.  This certainly couldn't have been managed by an independent wheelchair user and a powerchair would have struggled with the slopes too. As much as I appreciated their assistance, I would rather we could have spent time out together as a family, rather than our family plus Jonathan the security guard.  There were seats in the middle area that had a burger van and marshmallow stall, although the seats (haybails and logs) were damp and unappealing.  The marshmallows were £2.50 for three mallows, and you weren't able to toast them yourselves!  I think there might have been portaloos, but I wasn't aware of disabled toilet facilities, and certainly not Changing Places facilities.    The paths were lit every couple of metres by a single low level light, and the cast were not lit, so I think people with visual impairments would struggle to access the event too.  Sadly I think this will also be the biggest reason why this event will not be successful, as because it was very difficult to take photos what captured the event to share on social media, unlike other forest light events.  All in all, this has been run by well meaning amateurs with no idea no real idea of how to provide even basic accessibility.  "
8018,"There are plenty of accessible parking spaces at the side of the Cineworld building which isn’t too far from the entrance. There are also a few accessibility parking spaces in front of the Cineworld building too, as well as many standard parking spaces.  I don’ know much about the public transport in this area of Dundee. However, there is a bus stop about a 5-minute walk away which goes from Blairgowrie to Dundee bus station. Then Dundee bus station is a 10-minute walk to Dundee train station. "
8019,Didn't see any signs around identifying the disabled toilet. Staff member advised me that there was one at the back of the store and that a key from a member of staff was required to access this. Staff member wasn't sure whether or not there was an alarm cord. Didn't view the actual toilet so unable to comment on the spacing etc.
8020,"The trail follow the route of the former light railway so no inclines. It's well surfaced. The access the trail, pick it up through the gate at the end of the car park that's furthest from the road.  The trail meanders through the valley. There are a couple of bumpy sections where tree roots have wrinkled the Tarmac but they were short lived and minor.  At the end of the track it's onto a minor road - follow it over the bridge and you'll see the tearoom on your right (over another small humpback bridge). Depending which day of the week it is, there's little traffic but keep your eyes peeled as there's no pavement.  This is a popular route for cycles so, especially at weekends, watch out for bikes along the whole trail. The surface in the tearoom seating area (we were outside as we have a dog) was a bit rough with loose chipping so. Sadly all the seating was picnic benches so difficult get a wheelchair close. This walk features in the Peak District miles without stiles book."
8021,"Roots is an urban farm shop with a café, serving a delicious range of savoury and sweet food."
8022,"There are 3 entrances to the theatre, all of which are step free. We had tickets in the stalls, so didn't visit the upper floors of the theatre, but there was a lift providing step free access.  When we arrived the doors of the auditorium hadn't opened. The area outside the stalls had a narrow corridor. There was a bar with the counter at standing height. Round the corner there were 2 seats. In the opposite direction by the bix office there was more space but a standing are only. No other seating was available so I ended up standing, which is difficult with my crutch.  There was a sign saying large bags could not be taken into the auditorium, see photo. I had a small handbag with me so I  was ok but my friend had to put her rucksack in the cloakroom which was upstairs.   On the theatre's website there is an access page and a map of the seating plan, however this does not provide any access information. The stalls were we sat are step free with a slope down to the stage."
8023,"Offers of help with the door, let us swap our booked table for a more suitable one where I could stash my wheelchair."
8024,"It was easy enough to get into foyer and reception desk, by using the ramp next to disabled parking bays. (3*). The parking is free, by getting passcode from reception desk.  There is a bar and cafe like eating place, easy enough to get in as on the level. However, the terrace garden has steps from the bar area, unless you go all the way around to the restaurant area, then you can access the terrace area, which is a sun trap, so very nice to use.   The gardens are of no use as steps in use to be able to use  the grounds. The staff are very helpful and willing, and cost of bar food and drinks are typical hotel costs. The coffee, tea and hot chocolate are very good and very hot on the many occasions we have ordered. (4*).   Restaurant very plain and simple, (3*) disappointing, and not appealing,  but food is of high standard and well prepared (4*).  However, to arrive into restaurant, there is a very steep and twisting ramp route to get there with tight corners (2*). The toilets are old and so so, (3*).  There is a swimming pool available (4*).  It is not really a disabled friendly hotel, but the staff are very good and will do what they can to help you, and full marks to Joe the headwaiter who really looks after you. We would recommend this hotel however, despite it being difficult for disabled wheelchair user, and has become one of our favorite hotels to visit for a few hours."
8025,"Everything is on the level,  no stairs to worry about. If needed there are two lifts, card controlled for safety. Plenty of room to move around, never tight anywhere, and you can get to see all you need."
8026,Great... When you could find it!! The biggest problem with the loo was that the door was plastered in Fringe posters and flyers making it very well camouflaged and hard to find.
8027,"I'm assuming you mean the inside of the venue, and that is certainly accessible with lifts to all floors and easy accessible toilets."
8028,large tarmac car park with several good sized parking bays for blue badge holders nearest to the door
8029,"A first floor restaurant in a building with a lift to the seond and third floors but where the lift doesn't stop at the first floor (button locked off) with NO toilets on the first floor, never mind a disabled toilet.  Website gives no indication of these limitations and staff were unhelpful on our arrival - eventually having struggled with the stair access."
8030,12 Disabled bays by the entrance. Bus stop 400mtrs away with busy road to cross
8031,"Great build your own burgers. Good access to ground floor with accessible bathroom, no lift to downstairs area."
8032,There are ladies and gents toilets available there was a notice next to the ladies that said a wheelchair toilet was available to ask staff?.
8033,"Very helpful, happy to help locate items, give advice about plants etc, will carry items to your car. Self service tearoom, but staff happy to carry items to a table for you"
8034,The disabled loo is in the backstage area which was pointed out to us. The toilet was cold and they only had wall bars as opposed to a pull down bar. The toilet was clean with enough room for a medium sized wheelchair. There is not enough room for a carer. 
8035,"The restaurant is pretty far from town so transport may be an issue. There is only one, rather small car park out front (no disabled spaces)."
8036,Single yellow line with disabled badge 200ft away from the main entrance
8037,"Good Access to get in, but no accessible loo. disabled shopping trolleys available. Could do with more staff."
8038,"Newborough Forest is absolutely beautiful but it is hit and miss with access. Sometimes possible and sometimes not.  Parking is no problem at all with plenty dedicated blue badge spaces. Very open space and flat.  Right by the car park there is short board walk taking you straight to wonderful views of the Llanddwyn beach and a picnic bench on the board walk. You can’t get on the beach as a wheelchair user which is such a shame but it is certainly nice to see the scenery. If it has been windy then it can be difficult or not possible to cross the boardwalk due to sand blowing over and depositing a thick layer of sand on the board walk (see picture). On a day where sand is minimal, it’s perfectly possible as we have done so on other occasions but couldn’t on this visit. See photos.    The Forrest has an easy nature trail (yellow route). We have done this before in a manual wheelchair but it’s challenging. When we have done it in the Power Chair, it was much easier and manageable so I would say if you want an easy ride, use a Power Chair. It is mainly level and flat but it’s a Forrest so the odd lump and bump. And branches on the floor etc. There are benches around the forest.  Again it can present as an issue if sand has blown over into the route (see photo).  If you are in the area, it’s worth a drive to see if the paths are clear. When they are, it’s a really lovely walk. The drive into the forest is beautiful.  There is an accessible toilet and parking is free with a blue badge (scan the barcode on the back of your blue badge on the way out and the barrier will lift)."
8039,Staff are always very friendly at this train station.
8040,Easy to get into. There is only one. It is quite large and well equipped though.
8041,"I did not see any changing places toilets. In one hall all the disabled toilets are inside the gendered toilets, inaccessible for wheelchairs and scooters, people won’t move out of the way if there is a queue, and I found mops and cleaning equipment stored in one. In the other hall where there is separate accessible toilets there are no radar keys so used by all. There are more upstairs, but there's only one lift so you often have to queue for ages to use the lift that malfunctions. Very poor for a venue of this size. "
8042,We found the access for two of our group who have mobility issues was very good and made use of the lifts to access the building which were clearly signposted.
8043,"What can I say that others haven't already said, this place is fantastic with everything you need provided or available to make your break with a disabled family member that much easier and the staff are brilliant, can't recommend Homelands highly enough"
8044,"This German bar has Level access. It has a good party atmosphere on the weekends, Good food, and friendly staff."
8045,There is no accessible toilet at this site.
8046,Staff are always very friendly in Mimi's and will offer you a very warm welcome.
8047,"(I'm reviewing as someone with limited mobility, but not a wheelchair user) I recently attended a gig at shepherd's bush empire, using their access booking process. The process was really straight forward and everyone I dealt with on email and phone was great. I was advised to provide a pip letter a few days in advance of tickets going on sale so that I was already set up on their system. I also completed a form outlining what help I needed. On ticket sales day, everything was straight forward and my booking for me and a companion was confirmed with an email and a letter a few days later with instructions on what too expect on the day. When we arrived at the venue, we parked easily in the road behind the venue (get there a bit early though). After collecting our tickets from box office we were given access via the stage door (avoiding having to stand in the queue) and a member of staff met us to take us to level one in the lift. Non wheel chair users are generally sat on level one as long as you are OK with a couple of steps. The member of staff showed us where the nearest bar was, where the toilets are (again, there are a few stairs to the loos, one which is very high), and then she showed us to our seat which there were no steps too and had a great view! After the gig finished, we just had to wait for the bulk of the crowd to file out, then a member of staff took us back down in the stage door lift. All in all, I was really impressed with the level of care and attention to detail that this venue take. I really got the sense that they just want everyone to enjoy the venue and not be held back by barriers. Will definitely consider attending events there in the future. Whilst I didn't use it, I believe there is a platform on the ground floor for wheel chair users and a disabled toilet on the same floor."
8048,Lots of staff on hand and generally attentive.
8049,"Lovely, supportive staff. Great opportunities for young people with SEND. Fully accessible. My son has been going regularly since last year and the staff have helped him increase in confidence and gain Sailing qualifications. He now has a real passion for being on or around the water! "
8050,"There is disabled parking on the market square just for disabled people. However, the pavement is partially cobbled and cars were parked up on the pavement making me have to go into the road."
8051,"This is accommodation built specifically for special needs, and after 3 visits we can't find anything that has been missed. Look at the website for photos."
8052,Good signage.  A ramp at the opposite side of the door and automatic door. 
8053,Staff were really lovely and friendly. When I returned they remembered me from earlier in the week. 
8054,Only limited access with a maze of lifts...
